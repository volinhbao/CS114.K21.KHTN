Title,Review
"As a viewer that actually went to TIFF and witnessed this film and didn't want to believe the hype, it is an absolute MASTERPIECE and Phoenix is a certified legend.","I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema."
Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.3,602 out of 4,398 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Only certain people can relate,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.3,073 out of 3,863 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Perfect in every aspect.,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.3,318 out of 4,205 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
MASTERPIECE 😍,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime2,876 out of 3,670 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
The Hype is real,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.2,458 out of 3,138 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director2,094 out of 2,746 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Went for a second time to watch,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.1,965 out of 2,620 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
"Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight.","It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.1,758 out of 2,415 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Finally, a REAL movie","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.929 out of 1,372 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joker > Endgame,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.1,417 out of 2,133 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Critics are useless!,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
BELIEVE THE HYPE,"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.618 out of 1,018 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Masterpiece.,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.531 out of 883 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Requiem of a broken man,"The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity""
& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.
Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.
The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.

Brilliant. And best joker I've ever seen,"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.442 out of 776 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Movie of the Decade,"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it.503 out of 889 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away
1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker."
The Rise of the Joker!,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10"

Saw it tonight and had to make an account so I can tell everyone how good it is,"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger?

Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinema,"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before."
Astonishing Masterpiece,"What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.280 out of 531 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Stop comparing it with Endgame,"Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)272 out of 536 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+"

Joaquin phoenix is god,"Joaquin Phoenix certainly did an impressive, impeccable and magnificent job. I'm very dedicated to the role... Valla prepared himself very well and explained step by step how he managed to characterize himself in the best possible way for his role and how only great actors do: very professional. I am infinitely grateful that he has taken the time to investigate about the disorders, about the drugs, but above all for the time that he has dedicated to perfecting such an important detail as the Joker's laugh, a laugh that is so impactful and full of pain, frustration, anger and in many cases madness. A wonderful experience in the cinema for a lot with a great message, which unlike what has been said, has left me thinking about the responsibility we have in a society that instead of helping feeds violence.3 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Masterpiece,"Yesterday was that day, when I understand, that I have touched history. This movie will drag you in your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering. This masterpiece will grind you, like a meat grinder and you will watch it in silence and with open mouth. Like the whole cinema will.
I don't like comics movie, marvel is very pompous, absurd and insipid. In my opinion. It's not an art, it's just an attraction. As DC movies was too. But now DC made history, the made art and made drama.
To be more understandable. When you watch for example Avengers or League of Justice you are eating McDonald's hamburger. But when you watch Joker you are eating 1000$ stake in the most luxurious restaurant in the world.186 out of 388 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Film of the year (if not of the decade),"I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get."

The best thing DC has done since Dark Knight,"Joker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters.177 out of 371 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Clear the Shelf for the Oscars,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie.

Masterpiece *Movie Of the Year* Best Actor - Joaquin Phoenix*,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!"

A Huge Leap In The Right Direction For DC Films,"This is a dark, twisted, sad and sympathetic take of possibly the most enduring comic book villain of all time. DC would be wise to keep taking risks like this and blurring the genre lines because this is where they have a change to excel in an area the MCU won't cross into for fear of not being family friendly. If you cannot match Marvel in an interconnected universe then the answer lies squarely in making quality solo, if not one-off films like this. Phoenix is one of the top actors of his generation and I think it is possible to judge this take on Joker without even comparing to Ledger's. Both are genius and both very different. I have to go off topic and say the one person I'd love to have seen play a live action version was Mark Hamill at the right point in time but we'll have to just give him the best maniacal Joker laugh award and be content with that.6 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.","Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.139 out of 299 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Spare me the ""best comic book movie ever"" nonsense.","It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.106 out of 227 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
One of THE BEST PERFORMANCE ever!,"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.
It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.
Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.99 out of 211 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Disturbingly brilliant film making,"Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves."

"Led by a stunning Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is an instant classic","Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5"

Chilling and deep,"Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10"
DC's masterpiece. Although a huge risk for the studio -- it paid of. A lot.,"I had the chance of seeing a screening of Joker at the Venice Film Festival last week. 'Joker' was easily one of the highlights of the festival thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing.Although the movie consists of an amazing supporting cast, you mostly watch the movie through Arthur's (Joker's) lenses. Arthur is present in every scene of the movie, ala taxi drive. The movie clearly draws inspiration from Scorsese's 80s work (most notably from Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy. There's a lot of nods and easter eggs for the fans of those two movies). The gotham city we see in this movie is the most corrupt version to date, which is to be expected when our beloved caped crusader doesn't exist. It's a nightmarish vision of New York where corruption, crime and chaos are the leading forces behind everything. The story takes clever twists and turns that will leave even the most hardcore and well-read DC fans with their jaws on the floor. I wish I could talk about them but I don't want to go into spoilers. As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the clown prince of crime, there's really not much to say that you haven't read already. Phoenix literally transforms into both the role of Arthur Fleck and the Joker, giving us a super realistic and groundbreaking performance that even the Oscars cant snob. Joker is a strong contender for best picture.This movie is a must watch for both comic book and drama fans alike. It's a deep character study of a mentally ill man slowly sinking into madness that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 from me. I cant wait to see more small budget comic book movies about other DC villains (or heroes!)."
It is the movie to be watched several times and maybe more,"First of all he film is a prophecy. The outcome is depressive but very realistic looking on it from our days events.

All It Takes Is One Bad Day!,"Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors."
Best movie this year so far,"I was so hype after the trailer, and kinda expecting to be disappointed because DC you khow... but well it turn out even better than what the trailer had shown, and im grad its.

That's Life,"Joker is a contemporary example of a chef-d'oeuvre. It's a monumental piece of art. In essence, it's a masterpiece. Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix in a once in a lifetime portrayal of an iconic comic book villain. Barring any connection to the source material, Joker stands on its own as a film that will be upheld in the annals of the decade's best films.Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a mentally unstable man who is trying to find his place in a society that rejects him. Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur is perfection. Phoenix captures the essence of life with mental illness. In a career with so many masterful character portrayals, this is the one that viewers will cite as Phoenix's crown jewel. The emotion within the film supersedes great acting by taking a step into reality. Arthur Fleck is a character that is written so well and so real that it hurts. Where much of the media stigmatizes mental illness, the character of Arthur Fleck humanizes it.The cinematography in this movie is incredible. 2019 has been a year of great camera work, and this film spearheads the year. There are many iconic scenes layered throughout the film that are phenomenally shot. As the movie progresses, the film grows exceptionally in terms of cinematography. At times it is hard to tell whether the movie was shot digitally or on film. Essentially, this movie bridges the gaps between new wave cinema and contemporary cinema in a graceful manner. The lighting used within the film is atmospheric and successfully matches Arthur's mood throughout the film. The cinematography is masterful.This film is a Dramatic, Psychological Thriller with a great twist. The writing is insanely clever. The suspense is uncanny. The ending is satisfying and chilling. The supporting cast are great. They add weight to Arthur's emotion, successfully building him up and progressing his development. The soundtrack is iconic. The music enhances the overall experience as opposed to watering it down with noise. This film is damn near perfection. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix created a modern masterpieceOverall, Joker is a classic in the making. It challenges the stigma surrounding mental illness, presenting a narrative coupled with classism. This movie is important. In a zeitgeist where mental instability is a common issue, this film gives voice to the voiceless."
No joke - it's brilliant,"I'll leave all the glossy remarks to the paid critics.I simply want to say that seldom have I been so riveted by a performance as I was last night.I'm primarily a comic Fan, long term too. Most adaptions are less than rubbish. This is excellent. Phoenix is Oscar worthy and the production is terrific.Being set in the past removes the over abundance of tech and gadgets which suits the character and the myth. It also allows the actors and the words to shine.The photography, the music (wow) and the supporting cast was flawless.So pleased it's still possible to make a movie like this."
Flawless Storytelling,"Casting was really good. No crazy surprise breakaway performances - everybody fit their parts and held their own (which is hard in the face of Phoenix and DeNiro).But the way the story unfolds, the foreshadowing, the grand revelations - absolutely masterful!

"Uncomfortable, affecting, triumphant, dark","This movie will affect you. It speaks to society, it speaks to the human condition, it speaks to our darker instincts. It's gritty, human, and in some small way profound.It's beautifully shot, artistic, very well acted, the the score is absolutely effective and well done. I don't rate this 10 lightly. It's not a film to be merely entertained, but it is a ride, and it's a film to talk about.

"Uncomfortable,Disturbing,Genius!","I haven't sat through the entire credits in stunned silence since ''let the right one in"" baring no resemblance to this movie whatsoever I was left completely speechless as to what I'd just witnessed. The term masterpiece is thrown around alot these days but Jaquin's nailed on performance of one of society's forgotton tormented souls that inevitabley arcs into the fragile but brutal criminal psychopath we know as the joker is understatedley 'perfect' to a level where the viewer is left to almost encourage Aurthur's inevitable wrong doings and sucker you into morally second guessing yourself with 'is he actually doing wrong?'
I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well.

The Perfect Storm portrayal of American society,"A country that makes mental health care treatment unaffordable to the poor (great surprise many of them are...), and blames poor people for being unsuccessful, thereby pushing them to the edges of society. Add to that the second amendment and handing out assault riffles to anyone, and there you have it The Perfect Storm.The most symbolic scene in my opinion is when the Joker puts a gun to his head and we see his face painted in red white and blue...An important movie, that will hopefully emphasize the problem, paving a way for a solution.24 out of 49 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Incredible Work of Art!,"One of the best movies of ALL TIME! The final image is as powerful as cinema gets and marks JOKER as a modern masterpiece.

Everything in the film has a greater, more universal meaning, and it's not rocket science to figure out what stands for what. The simplicity of its metaphors doesn't dull the impact as a sensory experience, though, because it's still pretty potent stuff.

The subtleties and the nuances of his gestures are moving. I could not believe what my eyes were seeing. No offence to the other past attempts, but they do not go anywhere near this.

Rare occasion when the hype/buzz/comparisons are correct - Fantastic!,"I personally loved the film but, let's be honest, you don't care what I think.
Why would you... you don't even know me.No, YOU want to know if YOU'LL like the film and are looking for signs (occasionally hidden deep inside an ocean of egocentric opinions) as to whether or not you will.The answers simple.If you want, or are expecting, ANY semblance of a ""comic book"" movie there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It's not. And it doesn't attempt to be.The common comparison of ""If you like Taxi Driver, you'll love this"" is over-simplified yet astoundingly accurate.
It's true. If you're a fan of Taxi Driver, or similar films, you'll be right at home laughing (when you shouldn't be) along with Joker.The acting's outstanding across the board. Cinematography is absolutely fantastic. Everything from set design to editing add to the fact we now have another (rare) classic-in-the-waiting film that happens to draw from a comic book series."

"Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period.","Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.
Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed ""Fear City.""This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself ""God's lonely man"" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.
The Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
Its not a film its Art,It would take me hours to describe my feelings for this movie.I went to the cinema expecting to see a great performance from Phoenix...but...it wasnt just him....Everything was great the story the music the photography directing...Phoenix will win the oscar (im sorry for the rest of the contestants)..Everything is just WOW about him ...what a great movie ...Just a reminder to Hollywood that a great script with a great acting has no need of special effects or cgi or action scenes or whatever to make the top...Go back to movies like that ..make sure the story is good and the acting is good and forget about the restCongraz to everyone for that masterpiece...and we the viewers thank you!37 out of 81 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

One of the most fascinating and engrossing films ever made,"Joker is absolutely brilliant. It's gritty and utterly captivating. It's a tough watch at times and yet you can't look away. I would not recommend it for the faint of heart, but if you love crime drama, 1970s movies, or very early Scorsese films you might enjoy Joker. The film is getting a tough rap from the mainstream critics, mainly because it's very divisive, but also because it shines a harsh light on some very rough subjects, including class warfare, access to health care, and the mental health crisis in America. If any of these things make you uncomfortable don't go see this film. As for my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and so does the director. Yeah, it's that good.One last thing, the photography demands that you see it in the best possible quality. Also, for goodness sake, don't let your kids see this movie. This is not a Batman film. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. It's a ""hard R"" crime drama.17 out of 33 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Will Hopefully Be Talked About for a Long Time,"This masterpiece of a film shows how, one sort of small Director and one of the best actors of all time can come together to make a movie that reflects society in the past but also today in some of the worst ways possible.
With the director, Todd Phillips, that did movies like the Hangover and Old School he shows that not only can he make very funny comedies but also a dark and serious period film. He's camera work throughout the entire film with over the shoulder shots and tracking shots of characters show how much he cared about the style and the feel of the 1980's Gotham setting.
The stand out of the entire film was Joaquin Phoenix's performance of the titular character of The Joker, but it doesn't feel like he is playing a Joker that we have ever scene before. We know the look of him and we know what his name is but his back story and many unique aspects to the character such as his laugh, and his voice are very different. Joaquin Phoenix seems to know that he is playing Arthur Fleck more than he is playing The Joker. By losing 50 lbs and learning dance moves and practicing the laugh of people with Pathological Laughter shows how much he cared about this role and the challenge it took for him to become The Joker and Arthur Fleck.
This movie as a whole is a period film and a character study. It shows how society is today with corruption and looking out the little guy. It shows how people can be treated so poorly and not cared about. It shows the dangers of what can come when things are slowly taken away from a person in their life. It also shows how mental illness can affect a person and their outlook on life. One quote is ""what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?"". This perfectly sums up how society can warp the mind of someone especially someone with a mental illness.
This movie deserves all the praise it's getting and will hopefully be talked about for years to come."
Is there any way to rate this movie more than 10 stars?,"What can I say? This movie speaks for itself. It's amazing, it's mesmerizing, it's dark, it's brutal, it's the best movie of 2019 hands down. At first we see the sufferings of the main character Arthur Fleck. Then we see his journey into madness and accepting his identity, Joker. The ending was magnificent.

I created an account just to rate and comment on this movie. I am not a batman movies fan.,"I'm not usually a fan of comic based movies. I was never a fan of batman because I'm having a hard time taking people in costumes seriously. I went to watch joker because all of the hype and I was genuinely expecting it to be a so-so performance. I went there watching the Heath Ledger's joker before, which was OK in my opinion, as I said, I'm not a batman movies fan.
However.
This movie is not about batman, is not about comics, is not about superheros. This is a drama film. A drama which touches you deep inside on a special level, a movie which you feel because at least once you will sympathize with the joker. You will find yourself debating inside, whether he should be excused for his actions. Seeing Phoenix portray Arthur, from a beaten man, to become THE joker, quite by accident, is an extraordinary journey. The movie deserves all the praise it gets, and some.

Best in Venice. Best CBM of all time? Perhaps.,"Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film, delivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it. Phillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie film rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a love for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised. He navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay homage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves through each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits even roll.Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we actively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and strategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and most memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that you can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at times he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur Fleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers that will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise, while the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC characters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.So where does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark Knight."

Unreal Performance...,If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this it will only be because Hollywood is too sensitive. Probably best portrayal of the Joker yet...even though I still love Heath Ledger's version. This is just on another level! Would only warn against seeing this if you can't handle disturbing images/violence/dialogue. I have seen some of the worst cinema has to offer and I still got nervous sweats and felt incredibly uncomfortable the whole way through. Good luck!13 out of 24 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

Joker is not a movie. Its a phenomenon and a rare phenomenon.,"Went to watch the movie as a Heath ledger fan, came out as Joaquin Phoenix biggest fan. Best perfomance I've seen for any character.

The rundown on why people may or may not like the movie,"I loved the movie and believe it is one of my personal favorites ever, but many people are giving it bad reviews. This movie will please those who understand it and see the underlying messages, which makes it powerful, moving, entertaining, and real. But if you don't see the true meaning (or don't want to), it just seems like an unnecessarily dark and violent addition to the Batman ""franshise"". Another reason some people may dislike this movie and find it ""boring and too slow"" is because there is an extraordinary lack of CGI, which for me personally makes it all the better... and then some. If this sounds like a negative to you, please stick to The Avengers and don't waste your time, because you will. It's not cookie cutter, it's not a money grab, it's a movie that makes you think and can be perceived in many ways. Exceptional writing and a surreal acting performance turns this would-be great movie into something truly special.
There isn't a right way for Joker to be perceived, there is just a wrong way, and that's where the bad reviews come from, expecting something it was never meant to be, while missing/overlooking the greatness of this film."

One of the hardest things is living to the hype. It's even better.,"Little to say. I expected a masterpiece of a movie only based on comic books, and concentrated only in a character study for the ages.It is.Perfect story. Twists. Real drama. Real pain. Darkly funny at times, but not comedic in the least. It is violent, as it should, but never glorifying violence like the rest of the comic book adaptations (even the ones I love like Man of Steel or Infinity War or...)It is just perfect. I give my ""Thanks"" to all the people involved (I gave my money too, which is more important to them).----------- As a negative, It's not particularly original, with too many things (a few times, scenes) from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.
It is clearly better than those movies though"
"If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this, We confirm that the whole industry is fake!","This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC.19 out of 38 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Modern masterpiece - has got right under my skin!,"I would consider myself an avid film fan and in my 37 years, I have been privileged to watch many classic films that have an x-factor and capture the zeitgeist at the time. Some films are just beautifully put together and the combination of image and sound work together to create something more than its parts.Joker has the x-factor and works almost perfectly as a film. Seeing as perfect doesn't exist, this is as good as it gets. Throw in a performance on a Daniel Day-Lewis level and you have something very special. It clearly draws from Scorsese's work in the 1970s (Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy etc) but also has a very relevant social commentary about mental illness, the rich/poor divide and shared responsibility.The critical backlash after the initial praise is strange, but feels like a concerted effort to distance themselves from a film that could be too hot to handle. However, the people clearly disagree and the universal praise is totally deserving.This is a transportative and transformative film that looks backwards to redefine a genre and create a gem of a film. It's dark, depressing and glorious all at the same time."
No wonder critics are afraid of it.,"See. Its been such a long time since there has been a movie which is not supposed to make you feel happy or just give you moments. I am so happy that I got to witness this and see it. It will hit your soul. It will make you ask questions. It will make you think so hard, which is something we don't get in movies anymore.
Also, even though this is called ""Joker"", I hope people don't forget about Arthur, because I think that's what's important. The journey of Arthur to whatever he becomes.

"A classy character study on rise of the Clown Prince, Joaquin Phoenix & Todd Philips both deserve to be applauded","This is a brilliant film helmed by Todd Philips with an Oscar worthy turn by Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. This movie is more ""class"" than ""mass"". This is a very unique take on the character, very different from the Dark Knight's Joker that was played so awesomely by The late Heath Ledger. The film stays with you long after the end credits roll. I would like to add that it would be unfair & unnecessary to compare Joaquin's Joker with Ledger's Joker, since the same character is written differently in both films, and both these brilliant actors succeed in leaving their own unique impression on the viewer. And yes, the violence in this film has been totally overhyped some of the media outlets, the film is more a character study/drama with only a few scenes of violence that have been placed in sync with the story. Those expecting an ""action"" film, are likely to be disappointed.
Though this movie was planned as a standalone, I hope the success of this film inspires a Sequel.

Put on a happy face!!,"To appreciate ""Joker"" I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is (which usually comes from having gone through something traumatic, unfortunately). An example of dangerous compassion would be to, say, make a film made about the fragility of the human psyche, and make it so raw, so brutal, so balletic that by the time you leave the theatre you not only don't want to hurt anything but you desperately want an answer and a solution to the violence and mental health issues that have spun out of control around us.

Ultimate tale of morality,"It's been reported that some people found the level of violence so graphic they have walked out of the showing..I can understand why. It's inexcusable that they did as they missed the ultimate tale in morality and their lives will be poorer for that fact.If you expect to see a bells and whistle CGI extravagance, you'll be disappointed. If, like me, you want a psychonautical joyride into the creation of the character of Joker.. open yourself to the lesson you're about to receive.Joaquin's portrayal is by far the superior version and most credible I have watched to date and his is a performance, I feel, cannot be surpassed, and should not, as here is the ultimate lesson of the nature of humanity - a poignant tale of human kindness and the consequences when that chain fails.. there are always repercussions for that imbalance and in the Joker, we see the deepest, darkest, most tragic and twisted sequence of consequences that should be a wake up call for us all, particularly now with the social injustices that are now common place. A Joker is reflected in each dispossessed person and we are many.A genuine masterclass in acting by Phoenix. The collaboration between Todd Phillips and Scott Silver is sheer brilliance."

There are movies.. And there are masterpieces. This is one of them!,"I really liked the way heath ledger portrayed joker in dark knight. Funny, cunning, evil. If he was living today, he would have aced this movie. But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema.

"A true ""kino"" experience; the most revolutionary and subversive film since Fight Club","Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers)."

It might be my favourite Batman movie to date, and the Batman is not even in it!

"Ignore the critics, this is the movie of the decade!","I can see many scenes of this movie becoming iconic.The scene on the stairs and the fabulous but creepy dance Joker makes as a way to release anxiety. I can see it become famous just like the Rocky Balboa jump or the ""I am the King of the World"" standing with the open arms from Titanic.I haven't seen a movie this good in ages; It is funny, it is creepy, its has suspense, it has violence, action. It is intense. It shows mental illness in a way very few movies have done it in the past.It has smart jokes and if you ever felt depressed or lonely in your life (which most people have), you will understand it much better.The movie has 2 hours but it feels like 20 minutes providing such intensity and hanging on the edge of the seat story lineJoaquin deserves an Oscar, so does the movie not only because its great but to encourage director and movies companies to invest in more movies like this.Don't listen to the ""critics"" about this movie, the people are loving it and the voice of the people is the voice of God. Critics they go in the opposite direction of the flow because they see themselves as being ""different"" and they want to be different by saying something else than what everybody says in a bid to make them look like they ""know"" more than everyone else. If everybody loves a movie, they will hate it. And if everybody hates a movie, they will love it. Its always the same thing.Everyone can be a critic nowadays, thanks to the internet. So don't listen to them anymore, its just an outdated way of reviewing movies and not one bit reliable anymore.Go watch Joker and jump to your own conclusions, I bet you won't regret watching it."

Everything is perfect in this movie - story, acting, photography, music... hell even the colors of this world are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix carried the whole storry on his back - it was an one man show that took all your attention, imagination, stirred all your feelings and emotions and left you speechless when The End letters came on the screen. The best movie this year for sure - Phoenix deserves Oscar for this one and any other reward he can get in this world.

In line with Heith Ledger,"Ok, nobody can beat Heith Ledger.. But Joaquin Phoenix does the Joker extremely well. I've been waiting for a movie, dark and serious as the Dark knight. I've been longing for a movie that isn't like all the marvel comedies, a movie that feels real.The Joker is effectively shot, the story is perfect and the acting is genius.What I like most is that the Joker is still a mystery, Todd Phillips did not destroy the character. He developed him.The movie is obscure but still so clear, this is one of the best movies made.The fact that people are worried about mass shootings just strengthen the fact that the movie is exceptionally well made. (of course it does NOT promote violence, it just shows how dark violence in fact is, unlike for example Deadpool.)
If I wasn't clear enough, see the movie, yesterday."
Joker is a representation of modern societies troubles,"The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!15 out of 29 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Shockingly bad... in a good way. A very good way!,"This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after.15 out of 29 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
WOW!,"I always thought of Joker as a evil demonic clown who loves terrorizing people to get his rocks off.And I always wanted to see a really cool back story for him to see what turned him evil but this just blew me away.never ever has a movies protagonist/antagonist made me feel so weird inside how is it it possible someone can be so evil and yet we can sympathize with him ,such a weird feeling I can't stop thinking of it.Brilliant cinematography ,score ,acting ,story ,twists & everything.10/1015 out of 29 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Do you want to hear a joke?,"Growing up I've seen all the iterations of the Joker character. From small screen to big screen. All of them are unique in their own way. Don't compare Phoenix to Ledger as the two Jokers are simply two different interpretations of the same concept. This is the story of the Joker from the inside out. There are no punchlines, no gimmicks and no silver lining. There is no hero in this film. This is a study on the concept of the Joker and how he became who he is. This movie is dark, terrifying, introspective and raw. Phoenix simply disappears in his role and you never wonder where he went. Everyone knows that the Joker is insane but never have we ever seen inside his mind like we do here. From top to bottom this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Phoenix has already won the best actor Oscar. It's just a matter of time before they hand it to him.15 out of 29 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joker begins,"This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse.
To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing.
Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line.
Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years.
Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question.
this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life.
This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line?
Where do you put a stop to it?
How could you have prevented this from happening?
The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him.
Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man.
The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie.
He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar.
Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another.
We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people.
No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us.
We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged.
It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts.
Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them.
This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here.
Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix.
This man is a wonder.
I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career.
You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her.
He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in.
From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie.
You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional.
I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day.
Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense?
Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience.
From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good.
Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events.
This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those.
This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible.
I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general."

The Damn Trailers...,"Holy hell this turned out to be a good movie. Really enjoyed it in the theaters. One of the few comic movies where you actually start feeling something for the main character. The empathy is born from the good writing and the phenomenal performance of Joaquin Phoenix.The only thing mildly bad stuff about the movie -which isnt an issue about the movie- are the trailers. Dc did it again with the ""lets expose almost every scene in the movie with trailers"" mindset. Dont get me wrong the first teaser with the ""Smile"" piece was really cool and got me hyped for the movie. But it felt like I kinda knew what was gonna happen already. I dont mean the whole scenes itself but where Arthur is gonna in the next scene and stuff.Even if the trailer kinda ruined my first watch I whole heartedly recommend this movie to everyone."
"An important, difficult, and beautifully artistic film to watch","I think it's understandable to see why people wouldn't like this movie, it's not a base villian orgin story that we expect from marvel or DC and I think many people expected that going in. The film is very uncomfortable and that's the point. At no point do you feel like the bad things Author is doing is ok, you know it's wrong but you have understanding on why this broken man is making these choices and the situations he's been forced into by predjudice and violence from an outside society. The praise for this movie is well deserved and the messages and themes are important and should be dissected. Though be really for a very bloody and intense experience.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A movie too good for a sequel,"I found this movie extremely interesting. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be so on point with how they wanted every scene in the movie to pan out. I really loved this movie start to finish. Every scene seemed carefully crafted with symbolism. It was simple yet complex. It was a movie that made you want to root for the bad guy.The only thing I find unfortunate, is that this seems like as good as it's going to get. WB is not going to give Todd Phillips the freedom to continue what he did here again now that it has made so much money. Even if they did, would the magic of this film be recaptured? I want to see more but at the same time I don't think you will get anything better than what was made from this movie.

Method acting at its best,"The amazing thing about The Joker is as usual you will get the typical movment and the way the joker acts , but this time it will make sense to you because they take you to his process of thoughts, the more i see a key moments from the movie the more im convinced with it .
I think Joaquin did an extraordinary job representing him, I dont think i've ever been more convenient by an act like the one he pulled off , i totally forgot he was acting and believed everything he did.

The most artistic film of the decade,"There are many good movies, a lot of great movies but there are only few movies that leave a mark on your conscience and make you think twice & give you lessons about what is life and how to live it. Joker is a movie that touches your heart in every way possible. It's the story of the world's most notorius & popular villan's life before he became a villain. What made him become a criminal and what pushed him to spread anarchy all over Gotham City.
It's a movie about how people change because of the people around them & how a man becomes a criminal because of the society in a light that we never saw before.
It's the most artistic movie because of it's character potrayals, all over music score, the screenplay, the directon & the cinematography.
Joaquin Phoenix also did an excellent job in helping the Joker to come back to life. There were no flaws in his acting & he did justice to the character & that is the hardest job to do.

The best movie of 2019 that perfectly captures this moment,"Brilliant film, in some aspects it's even better than its inspirations.P.S. To all people who constantly and annoyingly complain about Joker borrowing from old movies: you are giant hypocrites and terrible people. All movies borrow from other movies and works of art, you complain about that only if you didn't like the movie. Take a look at your favourite movies and tell me again this bs about originality. The Matrix ripped off a lot of stuff from the famous sci-fi books and manga. La La Land ripped off old musicals. Terminator and Aliens borrowed a lot from Robert A. Heinlein books. Reserviour Dogs literally ripped off City on Fire and The Killing, literally the same scenes in the same context. The Revenant copied shots and scenes from Tarkovsky movies. There's no original shot in Kill Bill. And I can go on and on. So stop with this bs about ripoff and originality and just say that you didn't like the movie if you didn't like it for the reasons that have to with the movie itself.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Oh Joaquin, you are spectacular!","Maligned, manic, masked, wounded, Oedipal, lonely, fragile. An Oscar-bound performance from an actor whose career has been rising Phoenix-esque since 2010's disastrous mocumentary ""I'm Still Here"".Director Todd Phillips gifts Joaquin with the role of a lifetime in this character study set in a post-populist Gotham, riddled with crime and trash, tracing the spiral from awkward loner to Killer Clown. The casting of De Niro as talk show host (and surrogate father) is heavily weighted by his roles in ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" both of which resonate with the themes of ""Joker"".The now-iconic Bronx staircase, appropriately located on Shakespeare Avenue, is a perfect setting for our anti-hero's descent into villaindom. But with his backstory exposed do we condemn him or cheer him on? Thus the filmmakers present a fitting commentary on our times in this morally ambiguous tale."
"A Deformed Beautiful, Dark Nightmare","In a world completely oversaturated with superhero movies featuring aliens, magic rocks, and constant cheesy jokes and one-liners, in comes this film that portrays the downfall of a man who only meant to do good. He is pushed down and thrown out by an uncaring world and becomes a symbol of rebellion. At the end I wanted to weep for his dark but perversely triumphant fate.

I got so into this movie and story that 2 hours flew, it had my attention the whole time. 90% of the scenes are pure masterpieces, when it comes to photography and writing, music is mesmerizing, fantastic. In the last couple of years i basically gave up on movies, mostly everything new was to some extent bad to me. I'm so glad that this movie was made and that i watched it, i will most definitely watch it again as soon as possible.

Phoenix nails it,"I cannot believe what a great actor Joaquin Phoenix is. From the evil emperor in Gladiator, an odd detective, a guy that falls in love with an operating system and now Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Only few actors reach the same height, but none would've played this role so well, not even Heath Ledger. Ledger's performance was legendary, but it takes another skill set to play an origin story.
I cannot help but feel empathy for poor Arthur, who is trying to live by the rules which a society that spits on him have enforced upon him. He actually seeks help, but the system fails him.  I still felt myself rooting for Arthur, I could certainly understand his motivation.
This might be the best film of this decade. I really hope Phoenix reprises this role in a later film. The score, cinematography, acting are all at least 9,5/10. Extremely recommended!2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"The King of Joker! Comedy it ain't, brilliant it is.","This is not just a great movie is a tremendous one!Phoenix is Joker.Phoenix is Oscar.The character development, back story and reason for being went way and above my expectations. I'd deliberately avoided all reviews and trailers ahead of visiting the cinema and boy I'm glad I did.It's been many years since I've attended a Sunday evening late showing in a cinema with a barely an empty seat, and each seat left entertained! The crowd when leaving were buzzing, something a kin to leaving a mega rock concert. That surely illustrates how good this is as an experience.Super Rats...haha, wonderful.Todd Phillips has made one of the films of this millennium,...and that's not an over statement. This maybe Joker but this film paints a connection closer between graphic novel and modern day society with its Inception-esque divides and dying lack of humanity and empathy.The Joker is made by and reinvents society. A CLASSIC!!! Thank you Mr Phillips and Mr Phoenix (and all involved)."
Haunting and captivating take on a villain,"This is by far my favorite movie I have seen. I rarely go to the theater, but I saw this movie on opening day with a friend, as well as the day after with some different friends. Without giving away spoilers, this movie is atmospherically a psychological horror movie with no jumpscares. Even causal movie fans will leave the theater unable to stop thinking about it.It's sad we don't get many movies like these. I will definitely watch it a third time when it comes out digitally.

A masterpiece,"It's not often a movie makes an impact on me. In fact it's close to rare. 
""Joker"" is a unique masterpiece in so many ways. I am absolutely blown away by the acting, music, cinematography, script, makeup, and the whole feel this movie has. It's dark, sad and very realistic. It does a great job at showing the viewer, a story of a troubled mind, and answers the question ""What if the joker lived in our world. How would he have gotten there. What could push a person so far out, and hate society so much"".
The scary thing is, you can really relate to his journey.

Empathy Dies and A Joker is Born,"Joker is making lots of headlines. Here's my take. Joker is a peer to A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver vs. a superhero movie. Joker is a very dark character piece on how a damaged loner is alienated beyond his breaking point. This is a very disturbing and excellent film. Joaquin Phoenix will be a Best Actor nominee for certain. The movie is drenched with important issues- mental illness, income disparity, healthcare, and how a society responds when these needs are not met. Joker is about the death of empathy. Jokers are created, they don't fall out of a comic book or become evil because they played too much Grand Theft Auto. I've read about folks walking out of this movie. I hope that those folks simply miscalculated, thinking they were going to see Iron Man or Captain America.

It definitely sends a message that people need to hear about our society now. Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance.

Joaquin plays a perfect tortured Joker.,"I saw the hype. I saw the negative spin the media tried to portray the movie in. I saw the reports of the eight minute standing ovation at the screenings. I saw the review bomb attempts the Rotten Tomatoes professional critics were giving Joker. And I went and watched the movie myself. Joaquin Phoenix has created a man who had his entire life and beliefs fall apart in a week, and learn that even those closest to him never really knew him, or lied to him, or were responsible for the pain he was going through his entire life. The worst part was, they did not even care or notice what had been done to him. His story, this take on Joker, this is what creates a supervillain, a man so broken by society that his last resort is to laugh at the futility and sadness and rage that has been forced upon him.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Send in the Oscars,"Incredible story with an incredible performance from Phoenix. It was such a complex character to portray and I can't imagine anybody else being able to do it. I was curious to see how he would approach the character and how the troubled soul would become 'The Joker'Todd Phillips has somehow tied the story in perfectly with Bruce Wayne and his parents, whilst using the platform as a homage to other films from this era (1979?), like King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It's both familiar and utterly unique.It's a scary portrayal of how a mentally troubled loner who is wronged by society can find comfort and their smile through dark means.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

We need more than a movie we need a series of Joker films,"We need a sequel of this phenominal origin story of the darkest villian ever.
Hats off to Todd's direction and the performance by Joaquin is breathtaking. This is best acting directing combo I have seen in recent years.
The cinematography is so beautiful that's I got completely hooked.
And making it R-Rated did the complete justice to this movie. We wouldn't grasp the darkness of Joker's character if it wouldn't be an R-Rated.
Some might argue that it's depressing. That's because the acting and the story is so amazing.
I was shocked that the movie is about a villain and I was feared that without a hero. It won't have to show but the character development of Arthur to Joker is really an amazing journey.
Besides, some scenes are so intense that you won't move your eyes from the screen.
The music was also wonderful and dark ofcourse.
Joker is spoussed to be the most dark, psychopathic, terrified, and weirdest villain. And Joaquin's Joker went beyond from all these villainous characteristics.
I truly hope that WB must think about making a spin-off series of Joker.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
No Words,"I went to the premier in my hometown, I've always gone to movie's premiers, and there is always clapping by the people at the end of the film, this wasn't the case. After the movie finished, everyone remained in their places, speechless, did not know what to do, what to say. I had the same reaction. This movies is impactful, deep, strong, and obviously has an Oscar-winning acting by Joaquin Phoenix.

Send in the clowns!,"Excellent casting, wonderful directing. A lot of thought has clearly gone into every scene. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. Music works well. All in all, a very good piece, yet not your average comic book adaptation.To those saying there's too much Joaquin in it: this is a character study and much of what we see is through Arthur's eyes.
To those commenting on Joaquin overdoing it: he plays a mentally unstable character, yet manages to portray every feeling in a believable way.
To those complaining there is too much drama, too little Joker specific mayhem: this is the becoming of.
To those saying it's depressing: yes, living with a mental illness is depressing. And no, society does't do much to help. (Do you never see impaired people being ridiculed in real life?)
To those commenting on how Gotham is dark: why was there a need for Batman, remind me?For the critics: get over yourselves."
So Spectacular I made an account to write this...,"A phenomenal film focusing on a man and his spiral through life and society and what that does to him. Inspired in part by 'The Killing Joke' with the focus around 'one bad day can drive anyone mad' we get to watch the amazing Phoenix spiral from unstable into pure madness. Throughout this process you will empathise and despise this character, yet be at the edge of your seat through every moment and corner on this spiral.An academy award winning performance without a doubt with many deeper concepts that critics and audiences will uncover over time after many viewings.A film and performance that will be studied for years to comes2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Not for Everyone,"You know a movie is great when the majority of the ratings are 1 or 10 stars. Obviously based off the 9.2 it's got a lot more 10's than 1's and there's a good reason for that.Those who gave this one star are either one of two things:1. Marvel cultists who will bash anything DC ever does.
2. People that went to this movie expecting it to be the usual cookie cutter superhero movie that is watered down in order to pander to both children and men...Anyways... You will either hate or love this movie. I don't believe there is an in between. It is provocative, vile, dark, and occasionally hard to watch, but aren't all the greatest movies?These are all elements of the world around us and we cannot just pretend like they don't exist, or blame movies for causing it.If you have a villain who is an insane, manic clown, then showing what led to that is not going to be pretty. It can't be.If you want sunshine and rainbows go watch Marvel on the Disney Channel.The character development in Joker was amazing, showing us how a comedian turned into a psycho-killer clown. Todd Phillips killed it, and Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his greatest performances ever.If you are reading this review and you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do; just go into it with an open mind, and realize that this is not your average superhero movie. This is a beautifully dark standalone film showing the transformation of Arthur Fleck, comedian, into Arthur Fleck, psychopath."
Just Amazing.,"I'm literally speechless. I cannot describe this amazing masterpiece in any other words. It's just Brilliant.

Words alone couldn't describe how beautiful,"As a DC comic fanboy, it completely blew me away. Words alone couldn't describe how beautiful this movie is. Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, terrifying, Masterpiece, every second.Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie. Everything about this Movie is masterful in every single way! Just as Christopher Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight Trilogy, #Joker is unlike anything we've ever seen before.I was pretty sure no one ever could match Heath ledger's Joker. But I was wrong, This might be the best DC film ever made. Joaquin pheonix breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing did the impossible. Heath ledger will be happy watching this movie from heaven.The film offers a dark look of 1980's Gotham City, as we never have seen before in comics. It brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.This movie kind of mirrors how I feel on a day to day basis. I would say its way better than the Endgame and The Dark Knight, but that's for me 😉
Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.Experience it... And the ending of the film just blows your brain away. A sure nomination for this year's Oscars."
Cinema at its finest!,"Joker is an absolute masterpiece that I believe will never be forgotten. Joaquin Phoenix did an astoundingly amazing performance. Even though there is no main conflict or plot in the movie, the character study and the character development is truly horrifying and disturbing. The cinematography is also something that will be worth the watch, the colour palette definitely sets the tone for the mood of the film. Overall, this masterpiece is disturbing, horrifying and definitely worth the watch. Every single scene in this movie is perfect and I'm not even exagerating.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Critics are kinda funny, aren't they?","I saw this movie yesterday and I was completely blown away by it. To say Joaquin did an amazing job is kind of pointless, because I can't think of a single movie where he wasn't amazing.The way Joker is ""set up"" through Arthur's experiences is clever and compelling. The movie is not as action packed as you might think, but I was shocked at some of the events and it was actually painful to sit though some parts of it. Not because it was too violent or something like that, but because you could actually believe the character was in real pain.I could talk all day about all the things I loved about it. But what I think it's really funny is that some critics are actually bashing the film. I shouldn't be surprised, but right now it has a score of 58 on Metacritic. IMDB score is 9.3.As I was reading some of the critics' reviews, I was actually asking myself if I went to see a different movie. But, you know, everyone's got a right to their opinion. The sad fact about ""the critic"" is that these people get paid to say things like ""Joker, an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing"" - The New York Times.Well, maybe some people are too smart compared to normal people like me. But, at the end of the day, the bright side of being a normal, maybe ""stupid"" person, is that you can enjoy the little things in life and be amazed everytime a star like Joaquin lights everything around him with his talent.I guess critics are already too bright, so there is no possibility of an enlightenment to them. Stupid people like me are tempted to think they are actually living in the dark."
One of The Darkest Films *EVER* Made; A Masterpiece,"An ultra-dark sociopathological study steeped in deep nihilistic psychology with wildly-violent social commentary, Joker is A Clockwork Orange x Taxi Driver x RFAD with a career performance_by_Phoenix_on_supervillains'_origins._9.8/10....Review: The Joker. 80+ years of chilling sociopathological laughs, psyche-haunting as sadistically as he does The Bat's in devilish chaos untempered by morality, and the ability to bring entire cities to their knees with no superpowers - ""just a few bullets and drums of gas."" But where does such an icon of evil - the greatest comic book villain of All-Time - come from? What indescribable tragedies or societal/mental-breakdowns could mold a normal citizen into a demonic presence bent solely on carrying out some dark marching order to leave death and destruction everywhere he goes? The Dark Knight had plenty of fun with this concept, spinning the scariest thing about The Joker - the fact he could come from anywhere as a symbol of the volatile darkness and sin lurking just underneath the surface of society - with multiple incongruent origin stories tailor-made to Ledger's next victim's biggest fear (R.I.P. Legend). As did The Killing Joke with a lightly-expositioned tease that still left more than enough gray area/ambiguity in origin. When this film was first announced, I'll admit: I was vehemently against the concept out of agreement with Nolan's analyses on the subject and personification of evil it would take a damn masterpiece, a film so dangerous police would have to guard the premiere, and game-changing descent into madness.. to make work. I'm happy to say, that's what we got.The stylized violence and portrait of a man broken by society. Phillips was kind of the odd-ball in the mix here; a wildcard that - known best for his savage comedy days of The Hangover - was the farthest thing I'd expect on the radar of Scorsese-like prospects to produce such a deep, dark psychological study that's anything but funny. Yet he impressively puts on the boxing gloves and tackles the un-tackle-able giving one of the most stylized portrayals of violence and darkest films EVER made - reminiscent of (and perhaps even at-level or *passing* All-Time Classics like Taxi Driver and A Clockwork Orange). His controls the slow, hypnotic descennt into madness of an innocent, even-puffballish man you could never possibly imagine could become the Joker into the man of the house with surgical skill and detail - slinging soul-wrenchingly dark tragedies at him with the help of the screenwriters like some messed-up God bent on his demise for our entertainment like the court's jester the character is modeled after. The violence and psyche-breaking macabre painted is absolutely brutal and some of the darkest and most audible gasp-inducing I've *ever* witnessed; we see a man stabbed in the eye then head thrown against the wall repeatedly until his brain's squished to mush while his blood splatters Phoenix's white bare face with that hint of red completing his joker make-up, on screen executions with a revolver, hospital patients suffocated, and child abuse with freaking radiators and beating him all swirling a completely-realistic backstory of where a guy like The Joker could come from. Philips even fits in some fan service amongst all the psychologically and viscerally-heavy sociopathology in Batman references and exact recreation of the finger gun recreation from Taxi Driver and royal blue Dark Knight police car-reversed shot also ending on a Shyamalan-ic twist ending not even breaking comics lore!Phoenix's performance. Already one of the top actors in the world boasting an illustrious 3x-Oscar nom'd filmography from the visceral You Were Never Really Here to opposite-spectrum Her and The Master, Joaquin Phoenix predictively rises to the ultimate supervillain role in unbelievable fashion. Nicholson said the role ""does something to you."" Leto did not break character the entire time while filming even sending castmates dead carcasses and prophylactics leading them to question if he was okay, and the All-Time legendary Ledger tragically lost his mind in the role ultimately overdosing in a hotel drug/madness-fueled rage unable to separate from reality any longer: THAT's how powerful this role is. Phoenix tackles it with masterful skill and ballsiness for one of the greatest performances of his career and a life-time take on the villain to end all villains - so visceral down to even miniscule details like physicality, varied going from innocent puffball to sadistic killer by the end of the story, and impressive in laugh alone it demands dissertational exposition - reportedly watching over 250+ hours of an actual medical/psychological condition called sociopathological laughing wherein patients laugh uncontrollably while unable to express other emotions - for that twinge of sorrow that finds immaculate fit in Phoenix's tragic-comedian portrayal. The rest of the performances by its storied cast are phenomenal too, especially Pacino's downright-sadistic talk show host milking victims for cash and fame, Zazie Beets' (not so) love interest, Frances Conroy's Wayne-obsessed mother so cold she questions her own son's dreams with lines like ""don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?"", and Cullens' evil portrayal of Thomas Wayne.Intellectually-complex sociopathology study and social commentary on extremely-important topics. The film tackles mental illness, consumerism, ""woke""/cancel culture, social media culture, human nature, noir-elements, and multiple philosophical ideologies from nihilism to cynicism.. all in under 2 hours through a comic book/supervillain-lens for one of the most impressive screenplays ever produced. As its tagline alludes to, we are all taught/conditioned from the time we are young minds - silly-putty in society's hands - to put on a happy face and hide our pain/failures while extenuating our accomplishments (real or fake) desperately seeking 5 minutes of fame or the approval of people we barely know to convince us our lives have meaning, whether it's fame in olden days or on social media today. That invisibility feeling mirrored by the effects of bullying for the enjoyment of others is dangerous and breeds violence/criminality of potential Joker-proportions as the film correctly brings to light also playing off the at-tim.. well, often-cruel (self-interested, greedy, etc.) nature of humans picking up right where Taxi Driver left off in harsh sociological analysis. The script is so dastardly in setting up the strings for Joaquin's transition to Joker that it presents us some of the harshest events a human being could endure - also definitely-realistic especially in this time period seemingly devolving in sensitivity/empathy as time goes on - like men of power and influence abandoning/covering up/locking away marital affairs without giving the victims even a dime of their billions, or inviting losers on their talk show just to embarrass them in front of millions as proto-clickbaiting as a showcase highlighting some of the worst, most callous, brutalistic, animalistic points of human nature surprisingly-widespread in society if you sit down and think about it. The mental illness cogitation is also phenomenal and IMPORTANT, playing up the depressed nihilism or even-suicidal thoughts these illnesses can induce with haunting quotes like ""I have never been happy for even one minute of my entire life"" and ""you ask weekly if i've had any bad thoughts - *all I have* are bad thoughts"", also hinting at its bludgeoned treatment by a society for just another instance of how cruel the system is rivalling any supervillain playing down serious medical conditions with terminal effects as ""fake"" or ""not a big deal""; ""something to suck up""; ""get over"", etc.Flaws in Joker are singularly limited to its opening. Irising-in to the dressing room of Phoenix's Arthur and him listening to crime reports while doing his make-up and enacting the cry/forced hands-smile from the posters is a bit premature and abrasive when we have no idea what's happened to make him so sad. The film takes a few minutes to get comfortable and hit its stride, but once it does - it is absolutely glorious. The crying over SJW-isms and controversy surrounding the film is absolutely *ridiculous*: 1) any real critic with even a shred of journalistic integrity can separate a legendary, All-Time great film from a couple of political disagreements (I also didn't see them have problems with in Taxi Driver or A Clockwork Orange as virtually-the-same concept but now a problem due to the times it's fashionable to be constantly-offended, virtue-signal, and be fake-""woke"" than do your duty to your field, 2) it's a VILLAIN origin film, what do you possibly expect: lightness and no violence? Also, villains have been humanized for empathy countless times in superhero media from Raimi's 2005 SM2 Doc Ock to Kingpin's family in Into The Spider-Verse mere months ago but not a peep of complaints it sounds like people just hold DC to a 10x-harder/impossible hypocrisy scale, and 3) do white men not deserve any empathy for objectively-tragic things happening in their lives like mother-strokes, child abuse, learning your *entire life and entire parenthood was a lie*, etc.? That is the opposite of ""woke"" if you ask me and animalistic disregard for human suffering with no compassion or empathy - democracy is founded on the difference and freedom of beliefs and expression it's literally racist and sexist to silence some by definition.Overall, Joker is one of the darkest films ever made and a masterpiece 2nd only to The Dark Knight for starting the ultra-realist trend in comic book films.An ultra-dark sociopathological study steeped in deep nihilistic psychology &realism with wildly-violent social commentary, Joker is A Clockwork Orange x Taxi Driver x RFAD with a career performance by Joaquin Phoenix on supervillains' originsOfficial CLC Score: 9.8/10"

Amazing,"Joker was a true masterpiece. One of the years best. Up there with endgame and once upon a time in Hollywood. Huge die hard joker fan for years. This movie did everything I wanted to see out of a joker film. Great set up and character development. 2nd act was a tiny bit slow, but still interesting. The 3rd act was incredibly. Very dark and suspenseful. Had a very well done ending. Phoenix's performance was as good as it gets. Possibly even better than the great Heath Ledger. Very very good movie. Go see it now. Diffinetly an oscar contender. Possibly in my top 10 of movies. Again, breathtaking performance from Phoenix. Perfect film. Really no flaws. Dark gritty and suspenseful. Again, great film.

Shortly it's amazing,"Joaquin Phoenix offers his own version of DC Comics' laughing psychopath in the upcoming Warner Bros. Joker movie.

That's no surprise since a week earlier, it got an eight-minute standing ovation from festival audience members who watched an early screening.""As the mentally ill and socially ignored Arthur, Phoenix burns a hole in the screen,"" our CNET reviewer Rich Trenholm writes.

A Masterpiece That Deserves Multiple Viewing,"I was fortunate enough to watch this movie on 2 October on an IMAX. And boy.... the movie surely lived up to its hype and humongous expectations. If Heath Ledger was menacing and mesmerizing as Joker in The Dark Knight, Joaquin Pheonix is that unstoppable force that gives us the Joker that we all truly deserved. You will feel his pain , his sorrows , his dreams , his anger... you will become .. the Joker. The movie got a standing ovation at the end. In fact, I got so much into the character, that I could correctly guess what the Joker's reaction would be , in couple of crucial scenes. This is what Tod Phillips and Joaquin Pheonix have achieved. Finally, this movie does not glorify violence and anarchy, it just shows what happens when you push certain people beyond certain boundaries.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Why Todd Phillipps Made This Film,"You will notice the far left journalists: the New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Guardian and the rest all despised ""Joker."" They made up different prevarications such as no fun, meaningless, nihilistic, dangerously provocative and on and on. The real reason they had to gang up on this film and Phillipps is that we are seeing this fantasy become reality in America.The far left run cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago and others look like Gotham. They are literally overflowing with filth, drug addicts, mental patients roaming free and bureaucrats running and enjoying it all. The are supported by hypocritical filmmakers with loads of money, politicians, and business leaders.Phillipps is famous for non-PC, in-your-face comedy: rude, crude and breakout funny. But he cannot make films like that anymore. No one can. The far left speech police are violent, hate-filled, arrogant and stupendously self-righteous. Joker is the far left dystopia that is our future, coming soon to a neighborhood near you. They want the border eliminated, jails opened, locks broken and the rights of middle class citizens taken to allow mass bedlam.They want the hard working, value driven bedrocks of society mutilated, defeated and destroyed in the ensuing melee. That has been their dream as under-realized by Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and modern socialists.This is a great film. It is a monumental film. It is not a comedy, it is a horror film. It is the kind of horror film few people pay to see: psychological horror and terror. Then why has it already made more than a billion dollars? Because there are so many people cheering for this very outcome. Others see it for it's greatest value: a look at the future."
Masterpiece,"What a movie!! From start to finish it is an absolute masterpiece, the way Phoenix portrays the Joker is a Oscar worthy performance. The movies overall message about mental health and how people get affected is amazing, it shows that doesn't matter what goes on people always have problems and always need help!!

The best Joker in history,What can I say? I'm a massive Batman fan and a little obsessed with the franchise. I wanted to watch this movie to get a background on the Joker to complete my Batman experience. I've watched every Batman ever made including the Adam West TV show as a kid.I came out of this movie in absolute awe and to be honest a little emotional. It was a beautiful portrayal of a beautifully mad man. I feel emotional after watching it. It spoke to me on so many levels. What would happen if we just let go and have in to the voices in our heads and ignored societies restraints? This was what happens.Hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt. Heath Ledger looks like Bonzo the clown compared to this.

"Not a Joker film, however...","I guess the people not happy with this film expected a typical ""Joker"" movie. It's not. It's a film about the man who 'becomes' the Joker. A character study. This is not a feel good movie and don't expect to leave the cinema feeling happy. It's depressing, it's bleak and it's quite uncomfortable to watch at points. It has a constant fog of dread hanging over it that's heavy.
You feel sorry for this person, probably even root for him and that's a real weird thing as we know what he eventually becomes, but I suspect that was the point.
The music score is outstanding, adding massively to the film in no other way I can think of than how the track from Jaws impacted that film so much.
The filmography is also top not notch.
Phoenix is absolutely electric, you cannot take your eyes off him. If he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, he might as well pack up and forget about it. He could do no more.
Best film I've seen in a long time, which is a weird thing as, again, you don't leave with a feel good vibe, but it's all the better for it.

"Dark, Miserable, and Chaos, but... Beautiful","This Joker is darker than Dark Knight's Joker, The most miserable Joker than any other Joker, And most chaos Godam City ever.

A perfect tribute to the Joker!,"The character of Joker received much more love even though being an antagonist in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Todd Philips did a phenomenal job of creating an origin story for Joker and had the guts to present a standalone movie to the public. This movie leaves you in a shock for a moment and makes you think a lot. Some shocking moments that totally grips you, I find no reason as to keep this movie reserved for only 18+
Camera movement and the shots taken are so cool that they deliver a story without a single dialogue being said. This movie keeps you glued to the screen till the end credits roll in.It is a must watch for all Joker Fans and I believe the count of these fans will increase all the more!11 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Incredible and captivating,"One of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. This movie has a lot of levels. The psychopath construction is uncomfortable and attractive. It brings an invitation to ask ourselves if the concept of ""good and bad"" makes sense. Because all of us have the potential to become monsters when we're not able to control nor understand our own demons. But only some can exploit their true nature by being precisely a monster. And that keeps me thinking about the bravery and its shadows. It's a movie that hangs onto you and assaults some proper ideas during a burst of laughter. Joaquin Phoenix does an unbelievable job, he's one of my favourite actors and his work impressed me deeply. Incredible art direction, the colours and photography are the perfect apology for Mr Todd Phillips's masterpiece.Incredible and captivating.14 out of 27 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
The best film of the year and possibly the best of the 21st century,"What to say about this film that does not reflect the title, is the best we have been able to enjoy lately, everything is wonderful, the exquisite photography, the right atmosphere, the amazing and unsurpassed script, all seasoned in addition with a sublime direction of Todd Phillips, which shows that we must follow him very closely in future projects.
And I leave a point exclusively for Joaquin Phoenix, the guaranteed winner of the next Oscar, in my opinion it is one of the best male performances in the history of the seventh art, I do not think there are concrete words to do justice to his interpretation, therefore I will not say anything else.

Amazing. Captivating. Immersive. Raw.,"I am typically a fan of what Marvel has done, and initially saw no point to this movie when it was announced and couldn't see Phoenix doing the role justice, particularly after Heath Ledger's brilliant take on the Joker.
How wrong was I? This movie starts slowly, and draws you into Arthur's world without you realising it until you can't look away from the screen for fear of missing a single second of it. It is raw, it is personal, it is disturbing, it is sad, and it is deeply resonant of some of the troubles we are experiencing today in the world. This is the Joker, arch-nemesis of Batman, yet you feel empathy for him, and can't completely disagree with his actions. He only hurts those who he perceives hurt him, even if his justice is fatal and doesn't befit the crime. ""Wrong me, and you are dead,"" is not justice, and each of his victims display their own weaknesses and frailties, and aren't inherently bad people.
This is a brilliant movie. One of the few I went back to the cinema to watch again. It deserves Oscar recognition for Phoenix, Todd Phillips, cinematography, and the score.

Possibly the best movie of all time,"I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting."

"As a fan of comics and good cinema, Wow!","As a lifelong fan of western comics, anime, TV sci-fi and cult & masterpiece movies, this film truly is a historical landmark of cinema. Kudos to Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Phillips, they have achieved something no one else had until now in the superhero genre, true art (Except maybe Nolan's and Ledger's Dark Knight).
Superhero-wise, this Joker has been brought to us under an entirely different light. He makes you feel sorry for him, mad at society for having forsaken such a hurt man. Appaled of how the system can abandon a sick and lonely person in the time of most need. Truly despicable are crowds of people who mock a man dressed as a clown with a smile, but who cries inside. A cruel, bitter and tasteless joke this is.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Amazing tragedy,"Dark, twisted and amazingly disturbing. Arthur is such a complex character. This movie isn't just abou t him as a character but an example of how a mentally ill person lives and wants to be normal. I have a mental illness as well and I relate to Arthur perfectly, people have let me down, I've felt like my life was worth nothing. And we mentally ill people we just want to be noticed and understood, and that's what Arthur really wanted in his life, I perfectly relate to him. This film also tells us how bullying can affect the victim and what a cruel world this is. Otherwise, the film felt heavy and tragic. I watched it 2 days ago and it's still bugging in my head. Could definitely watch it again.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
The best movie of 2019,"This movie is phenomenal.

So realistic that you feel bad for Arthur Fleck and you just wanna give him a hug.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A masterful play between the lines of insanity and tragedy,"This truly is Phoenix's magnum opus. Few films are able to have such strongly resonating and impactful displays of violence that over the span of the film, through such an emotionally developed character, creates an uneasy feeling of genuine consequence to each driving action that Arthur performs in the creation of his alter ego.Phoenix's performance is so unnervingly raw the viewer is left perplexed by the deep insight into the constantly decaying mind of the man behind the makeup. A pleasantly surprising dedication to a role prior known only to fans of the character as a chaotic evil.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Simply Brilliant,"The whole movie, starting from the very first scene, connects to you deeply. It is a rare movie, I'd say, these kind of movies are made once in a century. It has all kinds of emotions, lows and highs, ups and downs, everything. The way they connect the story between Arthur Fleck (early Joker) & kid Bruce Wayne (Batman in future) made so much sense and had so much meaning to it. The script, story, screenplay, direction, everything in the movie was on point. The Music Director - Hildur Guðnadóttir completely nailed the BGM.I don't think we can find any fault in the movie, because there was not even one single actor who acted a bit off. Everything in this movie, was simply, perfect.Hence, Simply Brilliant.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Already a timeless classic...,"The comparisons to Taxi Driver are more than accurate and reminds you of other loner-vigilante style noir movies (Drive), but make no mistake, this has it's own mystique. Other people have already (and will continue) to explain why this movie is already a timeless classic. The themes explored here are ubiquitous in decades of character study cinema, but it never feels dull in this movie, it feels like a mind-stimulating food-for-thought.This movie made me FEEL, it made it's presence FELT. There was palpable tension in the theater, we knew we were witnessing something truly grandiose, but restrained enough to not push the pretentious border. It's a shame that this movie might have a stigma around it due to hyperbolic hysteria by headline/attention-seeking critics because there are far more violent films out there than this, this just happened to call out society and make the creators of a psychopath feel culpable, the truth hurts. This movie tells the truth.Joaquin Phoenix is a master at playing the brooding/unhinged role.If you watch movies for the purpose of wanting something to leave an impression on you, this is your movie. It does that in spades, and is one that welcomes repeat viewing.My movie of the year for 2019. Don't think another will come close. The House That Jack Built was my movie of the year for 2018, so I guess you can say I have a certain taste :)"
DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS AMAZING MOVIE!!,"One of the greatest comic-book villain movies in years! This movie blew my mind away when I watched it and there was so much explaining necessary to actually figure out what the Joker's whole story is about in this movie! I even rewatched the movie to get an even better understanding to what's going on! What an amazing movie! But let's get to the aspects of the movie. The story is absolutely unique, being taken in a more realistic approach! He doesn't get dipped in acid and turn insane, instead its from real life factors that turn him insane! The joker already has a mental illness in the first place too and how the story sets off from there is truly shocking and disturbing! There is so much to this story to explain, even you can come up with many theories on joker's life! It's truly depressing but terrifying at the same time! Then the acting with the characters. Joaquin Phoenix did so good in playing the Joker that he deserves to win an Oscar for it! I would be shocked if he doesn't win an Oscar at all because his acting was spot on to disturb us and shock us! All the other actors/actresses that were left did great in their acting of their characters, with many giving a realistic reaction to the joker! Then the style of the movie. The movie did so well in not overusing dramatization and truly offered a great dark theme throughout the Joker movie! As much as I have to say, this movie is one of the greatest movies this year and its truly the greatest villain origin movie I've ever watched! Definite recommend for everyone to watch!"

"Certainly not Jack's ""Joker"" or even Heath's still an excellent and dark artistic performance from Joaquin that had my face smiling and that's life!","Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!"

THE PRINCE OF CRIME,"Watched it on day one, it's more than two months and I still have goosebumps. The movie isn't that original, isn't something that you haven't seen before, but it's original in its purpose and vision. Todd, Joaquin and the whole working team had made one of the most iconic movies of all time portraying a different and original version of the Joker we all know but he's a metal ill, twisted and a suffering man that tries to be loved, understood, he wants his tears to be dried and he wants to be one of us, but he can't, he knows he can't and for that he'll become something else, choosing a path that himself seems to not accept. Joker earns 10 stars from me, not only because it's a magnificent movie, but because it's easily recognisable and it will stuck in your minds as most of icons movies from the past has done with your mind.

Joaquin Phoenix is a now certified LEGENDARY actor!!! Jesus he was amazing in this movie, and delivers probably the greatest solo acting performance since heath ledger in the dark knight. I will admit the movie was a bit slow but I was easy to forgive since this is a character study kind of movie and it does say a lot about society. I won't go into deep specifics in this review but you'll know when you see it. I thought the cinematography was stunning of a run down Gotham City, the score was thrilling and mesmerizing. I can't get it out of my head, I just simply can't. I highly highly recommend this movie if you favor great acting and if you want your mind to be blown. Thank you for your time.14 out of 28 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Award Material - Brilliant,"I avoided this film for some time due to an aversion to violence (thinking more about needless comic book violence) but today, with a storm blowing hard outside, I watched it.
Not at all what I expected and certainly not always easy to look at (and not due to the scenery or lighting which were both very skilled).
Others may describe the excellent technicalities of the film but I'd like to add a more sociological aspect. We, society, never learn do we? It goes round and round; in this case class warfare, deliberately ignorant government, mockery of those who suffer and the self-righteousness of the elite.
Well Joker shows us the consequences and as history holds it is always a form of revolution, in this case violence and mayhem in the streets of Gotham.
How reflective of today's world.

"A Deep, Dark and Twisted Masterpiece - No Film in 2019 Comes Remotely Close","I will start off by saying this review will be spoiler free, as well as a minor disclaimer for those thinking about seeing Todd Phillip's Joker.If you are expecting your typical, over-done, run of the mill comic book movie. You won't find that here. This is not a film filled with jokes that either work or don't work; this isn't a movie where the heroes always win. This is a movie centered around a troubled man and his descent into madness.It is dark and, at times, horrifying. And it is an outstanding masterpiece because of that. Had this movie been toned down, it would not have been nearly as great as it is.Joker is centered around a failed, mentally-troubled comedian called Arthur Fleck. He is constantly looked down upon by society, beaten and bullied. And, as you may have guessed, this causes him to slowly lose his mind and become the Joker. That's not a spoiler, by the way. If you think that's a spoiler, look at the name and synopsis of the movie.It's filled with shocking, gruesome scenes. Tense encounters. A realistic depiction of how it is to lose sanity. And it is absolutely terrifying. A once innocent man trying to chase his dream like so many of us is beaten and bullied, or often ignored by society when it matters, becomes ones of the most notorious criminals in all of comic book history.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance that rivals that of Heath Ledger. And at times? It trumps Heath Ledger's Joker. It is crazy and sadistic and, at times, honestly haunting. Terrifying, even. The writing is absolutely incredible in this movie and complements Joaquin's acting abilities. I don't think there could have been anyone better to star in this movie than him.Acting his fantastic across the board. But this review would be incredibly long if I wrote as much about them as I have Phoenix. But everyone, from top to bottom, contributed to this masterpiece extremely well.If you've not seen it already, go see it! Just do not expect this to be like anything else you have seen. It's dark, twisted and haunting. It's not a happy-go-lucky, joke filled superhero flick.10/10"
Mary Shelly runs through Joaquin Phoenix in this masterpiece,"This dark film was something that I knew I'd see but maybe I'd wait til streaming release but without something to do on Halloween I took myself to movies.I did not read any reviews but as I sat in cinema watching every last credit scroll up the only word that seemed fitting was Masterpiece. It seems that's a word common to describe this.The frail and yet emotionally powerful physicality of Phoenix captivates and unsettles throughout.The clever weaving of different characters' storylines in this origin tale makes complete sense and nothing feels contrived. Whether or not (perhaps especially if you are not) a fan of superhero blockbusters this film should draw you in and haunt you.Much food for thought on how society deals with difference,...not paying lip service to it..the innocence of Frankenstein, grotesque and wanting love and acceptance in a cruel world definitely echoes in this universal story.I recommend to anyone who likes to be moved not just entertained.."

Something else🤡,"Just seen Joker.
What can i say....I loved every second of this beautiful and depressing movie. Yes it's Phoenix from beginning til the end, but he playes Joker so convincingly, you could only feel for him, care for him and love him.
(And no, i am not mentally ill)The entire movie is exceptionally well made, the story, the setting, the music and yes... Joaquin's portrayal of the joker is undoubtedly the most disturbing, I've ever seen.Do not compare with Nicholson or Ledger (still favorite) just watch and let this Joker do the laughing.No joke, the Oscar goes to.....8 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Horribly brilliant, I wish I could unsee this film and watch it again.","Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, this is the best movie you will see this year.
This movie is a visual treatise on mental heath, abuse and social marginalisation. It has not much to do with DC and the fictional character. It perfectly explores how a human being can unravel into a sociopath. They could have easily called it 'Making a madman' or something.Not sure why they picked the 1980s but it worked well, the music is excellent and quite diverse in parts. Grimy downtrodden NY/Gotham looks awesome and suits the story.Heath Ledger was excellent previously but this film is rooted in brutal reality and it is so different to everything that came before that it is justified as a standalone masterpiece.8 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Not only is this a masterpiece, but Phoenix totally rivals Ledger",Saw this movie in the after noon the week after it's release. Yea very disturbing and unsettling but what do you expect from a movie that has a mentally psycho clown in the front and center? I freaking loved every minute of this movie. Even Gotham looked fantastic and I think this is the best looking Gotham ever. Sorry Chris Nolan even though you made the best Batman films. Phoenix really sold it. His portrayal of the Joker was completely realistic and all of his laughs were so well done. The story was great as well.

WTF is wrong with the media,"Everything that has to be praised has. Joaquin's performance and psychological angle.

Current and essential viewing,"Where to begin. An essential story that had to be told. Not because its the Joker. Not because its DC or Batman related. Because it is current.What is more important for film than to lure with one illusion, only to present something unexpected yet essential. The Joker does this effortlessly. Even if the Joker wasn't a well known character this production would have worked. The movie presents a picture for something very prevalent in global western society today; the disintegration of societal values, structure, and security and its human impact on the less privileged in society.Arthur is the ultimate anti-hero and through his journey emerges as perhaps a more powerful hero than his arch nemesis to be. A David v Goliath type story. A hero is after all someone who stands up for the weak, injustice and those who cant stand up for themselves; Arthur has these traits, though not in a conventional sense. The weak in his story is him; what greater hero than someone who stands up for themselves and emerges triumpant ? My statement will of course have many people screaming given Arthur's chosen methods. What underlies it all is a person fighting back the only way they know how, once they've been pushed too far; at the story's core, Arthur is simply screaming for ""help"".What about mental health you shout? He is totally messed up and off his meds. Of course, because mental health is just something that is the cause not the result? Mental health is correlated to societal values, function and security. Arthur's mental health is the result of his environment, so we are all to blame for Arthur's situation."
Wow,"This is such an important film. Not just for an amazing look into the depths of a character we know little about but also for awareness of how we act around others and mental illness. A great film; dark, twisted and a story that's beautifully told and shot. An abolute masterpiece of modern cinema.8 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A smile on the face,"For years is No Country for Old Men my #1 movie of all time. Anton Chigurh still makes me freak out every time he flips his coin. Is not different in this movie.
Actually I have the same feeling watching Joker and the second time I went to the movie it felt like it was even faster ended, which is a good thing.
Jomer is raw, painfull and has a very good message to the world. If you don't get your eyes opened after watching this, it can be the other critics got their message right, which is to not let you see what's going on 'til today.About No Country for Old Men: it still has a special place in my heart, but I am pretty sure Joker will stay as #1 for a long time.8 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
UNBELIEVABLE! Ignore critic reviews,"Despite the fact that I went into this film with very high expectations I was still blown out of the water.

How this is rated poorly by critics blows my mind it clearly shows that critics are biased. Some bad reviews spoke about how the film was too dark and sadistic but that's merely the whole point of joker. He portrays a sadistic psychopath who has been pushed around in an unforgiving place and causes him to rebel. 10/10 best film of the year.8 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

DC rising like a 'Phoenix' from the ashes,"This is not a popcorn flick, very difficult to re-watch and a must-watch for all the Joker fans of the world. I'm a fan of Mark Hamill, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, the Arkham games joker, the numerous comic book stories and the Gotham TV series joker and this one definitely deserves to be one of the best takes on the deranged clown. I heard that the weight loss took a toll on Joaquin's health, I hope he recovers as soon as possible. Regarding whether or not he deserves an Oscar, I don't think you need an Oscar to really brand an artist on how good they are if that were the case, Christopher Nolan, Will Smith, and Robert Downey Jr. would have a bunch of them. Nevertheless, I do hope he gets nominated.I was wrong in saying that WB doesn't know how to use the DC villains after witnessing that performance from Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor and the wasted opportunity to make Jared Leto the main villain in suicide squad. They just need to find the right directors and excellent writers that these characters demand. Well done Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast for giving us something so fresh, not everything has to be a part of a universe and lead to bigger battles, maybe that's the reason the film turned out so well because it was under no such extra pressure. Maybe WB can learn from this and focus on making now movies like this because we've had enough popcorn flicks and team-ups and it's not always about the box office money, it's about sending a message.After witnessing 23 Marvel movies and DCEU's desperate attempt to keep up with the MCU and it's constant but pointless protest that 'They're different than Marvel', Joker was a bit of fresh air that I needed and all the comic book fans in the world deserve. Maybe the writing in this movie was as good as I think it is or maybe game of thrones season 8 lowered the bar because anything other than 'I don't want it' and 'She's my queen' made me want to applaud the writers."
The best this year,"This movie can makes you feel the bitterness, the sadness, the whole psychopathic transition
A perfect impact
You would definitely after this movie understand the Joker
Good music
good directed

Great movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.I will be honest - i did not expected ""Joker"" (2019) to be this amazing movie. I saw trailer, i liked it, then read that it is heavily influenced on ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" and thought that its going to be at least an interesting and not by a numbers comic book movie. And i was right - its far from any comic book movie i have seen ever, except for ""Logan"" and ""Dark Knight"". Well, know there is a ""Joker"". What made those two films exceptional? Its that they went beyond and in different direction then you conventional PG13 comic book flicks from Marvel. ""Joker"" on the other hand is a great character study movie - first thing. If you would remove Gotham city and some characters from Batman universe, this film wouldn't even had anything to do with comic book movies. The other thing is that its just superbly done - this is hands down best movie Todd Phillips has ever made (and i loved first ""Hangover""). Cinematography was gorgeous and very stylish, music was haunting and editing was top notch - this film at its running time 2 h run like wind for me. Oh ye, and then there is the best performance of the year (so far) by Joaquin Phoenix - his Joker i think stands on the same ground with a legendary performance by Heath Ledger - its that amazing, and a bit even more complex because in Dark Knight Joker was a side character - in here he is a central figure, and what a great character that was.Overall, ""Joker"" is a great character study movie, and a very unique comic book film. Its different, for sure and make no mistake its great not because its different - its because the bold direction creators have went with it and delivered it full. This is one of the very best films this year so far."

Joke all you want,"Joker is a near two hour, dark, somber, cinematic masterpiece, where we witness the origin of the greatest Batman villains of all time, and understand in great depth, what made him what he is. We can see why Phoenix won the Academy Award, as this great actor has done such a great volume of work, and this is his movie to shine. He does so much with his character, a brave acting feat. The movie too, plays Jokes on you, as you'll see. Granted, Joker is dark, but is just totally engrossing from start to finish, no matter where you watch it. We praise the joker's murderous actions too. De Niro as a scummy t.v. show host isn't shown enough, and we almost forget him, as being so engaged with Phoenix's brilliant take on the super villain. Joker is a deep character study, of alienation, humiliation, twisted imaginings, rejection, all those negatives. He isa truly tortured soul, his family history only amplifying that torture. The music is eerily terrific, and we so feel for poor old Arthur Fleck. The dark piece, had me laughing a few times, at some lines, and Phoenix's laugh though a trifle annoying, you wanna hear more. Way more than any other movie, this is one that demands your attention. No joke."
A Triumph!,"Joker is not only the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life or the best movie of the 2010s, it's the greatest comic book movie. No comic film before or after will ever come close to this level of greatness. Everything about this movie from the gripping emotional story to the tone to the music the acting and cinematography is just amazing. The best part is no CGI and it proved you don't need it to tell a good storyJoaquin Phoenix plays the best live action Joker we have ever seen. Throughout the movie we see his character, Arthur Fleck, constantly abused, mocked, bullied and picked on by society just because he's different. That he has a condition and is viewed as an outcast. By day he works as a party clown, while also taking care of his ill mother. It gets to the point where Arthur reached his breaking point and slowly transforms into the Clown Prince of Crime as we knowThis movie also did a brilliant job with adding so much realism and how society treats not just people like Arthur but anyone in general. There's a lot of nasty people out there that will take advantage and leave you high an dry when they have no more use for youA true masterpiece and a work of art"

"I wasn't expecting to like this movie, but somehow it gets better whenever I think about it.","I didn't want to like this movie. I thought that a Joker movie without Batman in it just wouldn't work and that it was a dumb idea. I have never been more wrong. The Joker was a very well made movie with great drama and a great story. The thing that really gets me are the messages of the movie. The story is about a guy who was beaten by society and treated like garbage until one day he snaps and shakes the system. I love how the Joker's jokes are something that nobody else can get because they don't understand.

"The movie is about a character, not action or explosions.","Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies. This movie is about a character, not action or explosions. Joaquin Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and how power can be obtained. Todd Phillips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every other important aspect of the film. The movie gave me instant 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' vibes, without copying both films. This movie will drag you into your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better joker - Heath or Joaquin? The answer is - both did a phenomenal job. And Joker is fortunate to have being played by two phenomenal actors.

Transfixed on Joaquin,"So I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard some of the hype and I've always been a fan of the Joker stories in the past. I knew Todd Phillips was a decent filmmaker and Joaquin was an amazing actor. What I didn't know, was how well-crafted this film would be. I didn't realize the length of the movie wouldn't be noticed because of how transfixed you were on Joaquin as Joker. I was mesmerized! The viewer is completely immersed into Arthur's world. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall, watching and holding your breath from the intensity. It's truly amazing, to not see an actor but to just simply see Arthur or Joker. I haven't felt this immersed in a character since Daniel Day Lewis played Abraham Lincoln. He deserves all of the buzz, all of the recognition and all of the praise. I'm almost disturbed by his performance because it was so raw and so real. I'm just awe struck.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Best movie of the year,"There's not much to say, from Joaquin's acting to Arthur's descent to insanity, this movie was so good. I am just mad at the media for saying ""this is going to inspire introverts like Arthur to shoot up a movie theater"" just because there was was a shooting in The Dark Knight, another movie that happened to have the Joker. But in reality the shooter picked the biggest screened movie at the time at random. It's rare to see a movie like this actually come out because of all the censorship of the media and everything has to be family friendly. Remember when in 2008, Call of Duty: World at War came out, nobody really cared about the nazi imagery or violence but just cared that it was a great representation of war? Why can't it be like that? Why does everyone have to be offended by every small detail these days? I know this has absolutely nothing to do with Joker anymore, but I can't think of another movie that was controversial because of the media and turned out to be amazing, because all the other ones have all been scared to be too realistic. Anyways, this is great movie.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Outstanding performance by Juaquin Phoenix,"Even while watching the movie for the second time it pulls me in so deep, it overwhelmes me with emotions and I'm left exhausted by the time the end credits roll in. Juaquin Phoenix manages to capture that certain moment of desperation and despair that only an unlucky few know about. The plot, the rest of the cast are left wanting but this movie is carried by the outstanding performance of Mr. Phoenix.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Finnaly! A movie!,"We really yearned for this one. In a day where you get shoved down the throat with cheap lines and cliché scenes we've got a movie, a film that really gets us back to what a film or a movie is supposed to be about. Something to shock you, to stop you for a moment, to take you in a world where the emotions are placed in the gestalt of the world perceived. It really connects well. Joaquin and Todd really overachieved this one for this age.

Best movie of 2019,"Masterpiece movie of the decade to influence generations.
Joker is a Traumatizing psychological drama/thriller that puts the spotlight on a comic book villian called joker.
Though the movie is inspired by the comic world which is imaginary, the movie feels real and authentic.
Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.
The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.
He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil.
The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.
The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.
The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.
Joker might be one of the darkest movies made in decades but definitely deserves to be watched with patience and attention because it's one of the few movies that besides giving audience entertainment it tries to make people think."
Hard to watch and so powerful,"I have to admit I have a short attention span however I could not even look away for a second during this movie.It's so hard to watch the pain Arthur is going through, battling with mental illness myself and seeing his journal in the beginning saying how people expect you to act like nothing is wrong hit home.This movie is not your average comic book, this is a deep though provoking drama.

Different Taste,"This movie come out with a different play I will say. Watching the trailer I dreamed about the movie would be much dark and more sympathetic to Joker. But in the hall I couldn't keep my eyes off the movie. It wasn't the movie that I thought it would be. Phoenix acting deserves some memorable rewards. I would recommend everyone can watch the movie if he/she has heart and brain to understand it. Do not go to the negative way, there is a lot to live in affirmative. Tod you are awesome.

Astonishing,The cinematic piece of art tells a unique and beautifully rethought origin story of the iconic villain Joker. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is captivating; everything from the way he dances to the way he forces smiles upon his face in the movie. The work of art integrates the stigma around mental health in our society today while dramatically showing how mistreated Arthur Fleck was by the fictional society in which he lives. Who would've thought that such a movie could be so moving? This film is special... the type that doesn't come around very often. It deserves endless credit and is 100% worth the watch.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

A modern masterpiece,"I went to see this movie a couple of weeks ago expecting a decent movie. However, after I came out of the theater I was shocked at the level of dedication needed to play the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix had to lose a ton of weight until he was basically skin and bone and play a convincing slide into insanity. His acting is so amazing that you forget that you are even watching a movie at all, and it is so mesmerizing to watch his new take on the Joker. This movie was engaging all the way through and had a perfect ending to match. What a fantastic movie.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
The Greatest Film I've ever seen.,"""Joker"" is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen, (and I've seen my fair share) thats not overstating it one bit on my part, the sheer impact this film had on me was overwhelming, and the absolute and genuine empathy I had for Arthur Fleck is heart felt, and the dark subject matter it deals with is true to our times, I was fully engrossed with him and in his corner throughout, I instantly knew I had just watched a masterpiece, from the very beginning to the very end of this film it has you totally and utterly encapsulated and fully absorbed, i urge everyone to see Joker you'll be watching the art of movie making! a Joker sequel could work or it could just be a stand alone film it really is that versatile 10/10 I would give it 100/10 if I could. 👌🏻🤡👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Amazing !,"One of the best films I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. The unraveling of a person suffering from mental illness was tough to watch in some scenes but I never felt his behaviour wasn't justified. I left the cinema feeling sorry for a man who'd always felt different and had been treated badly from a young age. JP didn't just throw himself into the role , he became Arthur. Not as violent as I was expected either so I don't reslly understand the controversy when it was released.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
This is a movie that stays with you.....,"The anticipation that I felt walking into this movie is very rare. I can only compare it to the same feeling of walking into a Christopher Nolan movie or Avengers endgame. It's an incredibly high bar of expectation and there was a thick atmosphere of excitement in the theater. I found this movie to be a masterpiece of film-making with an incredible lead performance. It covers the full spectrum. Wonderful storytelling and emotional beats, mixed with powerful dialogue and beautiful cinematography. The movie doesn't shy away from violence, and there is even some humorous moments of levity among the chaos and madness. I can't say enough about Joaquin Phoenix. He's a very special talent. The subtlety of his abilities are a joy to behold. He's a master of his craft. There are many standout moments in this movie and it tackles many very real issues - such as mental health awareness and social isolation. Highly recommended.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Unparalleled,"Incredible, believable depiction of not only mental illness but of a man who can be seen as a legitimate human being in the real world. Unlike Heath (RIP), this Joker is less of a ""performance"" and more of a legitimate depiction of the real mental illness GOOD people face. He reconstructs what ""good"" truly is and, in contrast, the powers that be define what ""good"" is for their own advantage.Rant/related to movie content:
The wealthy make laws to ***k all the other people they deem inferior or unwealthy, and a lot of us really are ***ked by the likes of these elitist egotistical devils.Anyways, enough of that. Watch the movie.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

So real it's uncomfortable,"This movie is depressing, brilliant and so real it's uncomfortable to watch. That being said, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting I have ever seen and this movie delivers a very realistic look at how the unfortunate, mentally ill, weak and awkward live as well as how they are treated. By the end of this movie, I found myself actually cheering for The Joker fueled by the compassion and sorrow I had for his hardships and the lack of support he sustained from a society that not only failed him but made it clear that no one really cares. It leaves you with the realization that yep, this is the world we live in, the real world, where the rich and privileged rule. I wanted The Joker to make his official appearance and cause an uprising of people who are so sick of being ignored and treated like dirt that they find a hero from a crazy, violent, broken man. This movie does not hold back, it comes at you full force and stirs emotions that are confusing. We're not supposed to cheer for the villain. But then, who is actually the villain?7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Joker is a masterpiece,"I can't believe that avengers as a better rating, that people cried and clapped at the end of avengers, full blown standing ovation, i was ready to get up at the end l
Of joker and clap as hard as i could, i knew it, i was sure about it, it was the best movie of the years maybe even the decade, but no, i was the only one with my brother and one other guy who got up and clapped at how good the movie, but nobody else...Joker is a dark and slow drama/thriller about a man living in a bad and difficult place, this place is called Gotham, you already know this place by heart as a fan, am I right?No, the joker will surprise you on every point, the soundtrack, the twist, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Everything makes sense and is really well put and done in this film. You are not only following a terrible man who wants to destroy the world, no, you are following the growing hatred of a man who has tried everything to be happy but will never be.It's a masterpiece that people will be talking about for years and oh my God, please. This film needs a better audience rating than the other shameless, useless and senseless disgusting things called avengers."

"Joaquin Phoenix, That's All","Not a single Comicbook movie excited me until this one and that's because of Joaquin and Joaquin only. This character is tailor made for someone like him who has given terrific and criminally underrated performances over the years in films like The Master, Walk The Line, Two Lovers and Inherent Vice. Todd Philips made the right decision to a character study psychological film rather than the usual adventure/action.Gotham City is like NYC in 1970s/80s a city with massive wealth inequality, rising crime and brutal austerity measures. In surroundings like this, a fragile and broken individual like Arthur Fleck is bound to explode but how he does and why he does is what we see for 121 minutes. The undertones on anarchy, capitalism and classism is quite brilliant and this is one of the films where we cheer for the guy we are supposed to dislike.Joaquin Phoenix not only does justice to Heath Ledger in this film but creates an own legacy for himself. It's a shame that a guy who has given better performances in movies like The Master and Walk The Line will probably win his much awaited Oscar for this role, a highly popular character to get noticed."

"Movie of the decade, in my mind!","This movie is a cinematic piece of art that must not be missed!People complaining that it was drawn out and had no plot are completely missing the point of the movie. It was a psychological analysis of a diathesis stress illness, namely schizophrenia. A man's decent into darkness after a childhood of abuse. It wasn't meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster with fast cars and CGI fighting rubbish.It was utterly necessary to have the elongated beginning, otherwise the brilliant cinematography and score at the conclusion would not have been so impactful.Phoenix, as usual, gave us a masterclass in acting. He lived every tiny schizophrenic moment of Fleck's mind and played it to perfection. If he doesn't win the Oscar this time, I swear I'll never watch it again!For me, this is the movie of the decade. I rarely see a movie twice, but I'm going back for this one a second time. 10 stars."

Brilliantly Crafted,"Since his chair as part of the official competition of the Venice Festival about a month and a half ago, ""Joker"" has become one of the most controversial, explosive and disputed films of the past decade. On the one hand, he came out of the festival with the Golden Lion and broke a glass ceiling for commercial products based on comic books, defined as a masterpiece by the European critics, and broke the United States in the last weekend. On the other hand, the American media pressed every name for a possible notoriety in the era of political health, director Todd Phillips became the social-boxing bag of societal networks, families of gunshot victims sought to scrap it and security was introduced to some of the halls in which it is screened. At the end of the last weekend, the film immigrated to Israel, and we could also see what the fuss was about.
Let's start with the only simple sentence you can say about the film: he describes the events that we know of the Batman, but this time from the jazz point of view, and tries to explain how the personality of one of the most famous arvillains in the popular culture has been played by Joaquin Phoenix, who went into the big shoes of Jack Nicholson, Heath and others who have done this before.
From here on, it gets complicated. It is easier to say what ""joker"" does not approve what he is. This is a sign that is hung this week in one of the New York cinemas, as part of the overall confusion of the country following the rise of the hit--""attention, please, it is not a comic film in the usual sense of the word, as you are.""
Indeed, ""Joker "" is really not a natural continuation of other successful arrangements for comic books from the last time. Not to Marvel's, and certainly not to those of the DC, whose legacy is based, although it has clear references to previous ""Batman"" movies. If we still have to say why this strange chicken is similar, it is a combination of psychological drama, a dark thriller, and a social satire. It is evident that its contents and style derive inspiration from the ""Taxi Driver"" and ""the King of Comedy"", two of the modern classics that Martin Scorsese created between the late seventies and the early 1980s, a fine and wild time in American cinema, which generally affects the film. Even the scene of his occurrence, the fictitious city of Gutheam at a vague point of time, mentions the cinematic representations of New York in those days, while there was still Sodom and Gomorrah of America.
And what about the man who becomes a gentleman? He suffers from a mental injury, which leads him to tell terrible jokes without being aware of it, and to burst into uncontrollable laughter, which makes him resemble some sort of Hollywood version of Assaf Ashtar at Comedy Store. His livelihood comes from his work as a clown, but even though he wants to make others happy, his hand is perceived as despicable, and brings back humiliation: Already in the first scene, a bunch of youngsters hit him on the street, and at a later stage, Thomas Wayne calls in contempt of ""clowns"" and all those lowlife living in his eyes that are not as wealthy as he is. This statement echoes of course the similar emissions that were made by Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton during their presidential campaigns against groups in the population, and strengthening the film's topical dimension.
If it is not enough for the hero's troubles, the capitalist elite's policy is leading to cuts in the welfare services and therefore also to the termination of the necessary treatments and the disease. And yet he has more hope: his mother terrorist planted him the faith that came to the world to bring them all a smile on his face, and that he would come out with something big. The open stage of a stand-up comedy club allows it to begin to realize this dream, and from there to bear eyes for the truly great fantasy--a performance in the program of his favorite light-Knight, Robert De Niro, that lihuku here is a wink to the ""King of comedy"", where they played the opposite role of an obsessive admirer of famous comedian (the same Played at the time of Jerry Lewis).
All this makes ""joker"" a smart, complex and relevant film that will be taught at universities and not only in the Department of film, but also mainly in social sciences. In the American media, audits were published that had been enjoyed by the arrogance that it was a foolish piece that was unaware of its meaning. The truth is reversed: there is not a moment here that is not on the banks of irony. If anything, the problem is that the result is so self-conscious that it already has something smug and more pressing.
In the end, the virtues cover up the disadvantages, which is the result that improves as it progresses, and the second part is powerful and even exemplary.
Behind this artistic success are some factors, other than the quality of the script we have already spoken about. First and foremost, the ""Joaquin Phoenix"" game, which officially establishes its status in the pantheon of the greatest, not only in his generation, but at all times. It is hard to think about many other players who were able to play such an extreme character without any phony character, and in a way that would make such a big impression. He is present in the film in almost every moment, carries him on his shoulders with dedication and a total determination, and builds a resting portrait.
On the side of Phoenix, though in a much smaller position, Robert De Niro reminds anyone who forgot what a big player he is. The two of these are the directors of the director Todd Phillips, who are not only in casting and guided by actors but also in all that is related to the scene, creating an atmosphere, placing a camera, editing, combining images into music and so on. Everything here is calculated, meticulous and effective, in everything concerning the picture and everything about sound. So, for example, once in a while we hear the movement of trains above the heads of the characters, which plays a double role: also creates a realistic sense of urban life, and also serves as a metaphor for a storm that is in the consciousness of the hero.
The film depicts a terrible reality: violent, popustic, passionate, hateful and almost merciless. What to do is the world we live in. ""Joker "" does not justify him, but just tries to understand how he was created, and how can I treat decay if you don't understand what his roots are? To me, this film is one of the five best movies I've ever seen, and I'm taking my hat off to anyone who's involved in his work."

The kind where those who make it really push it, really make it unique and artistic. This is exactly it, without a shadow of a doubt. A prequel to the whole Batman franchise thay shines like a well polished diamond, so perfect and captivating it feels almost out of place and in a league of it's own.

Joker is amazing, it's dark , deep but somehow through all this depression it's actually funny (in some scenes)!

If you find this movie boring then you probably won't like a lot of other movies, the shawshank redemption for example (its the top rated film of all time)! Joker is a masterpiece that blurs the line between reality and fiction, it's a serious movie with a serious message and I loved every last part of it!

It's a love it or hate it type of film,"You either LOVE this film or you HATE it. Plain and simple, sure there's people that find the middle ground between rating it 5-8 /10 but those are the people who see the flaws, and don't like them, or the ones who see the flaws, but thinks they help the movie more. Joker is a middle finger to the society we live in. Joker IS a satire, society sees your troubles and laughs in your face. VERY good film and it's a 10/10 without question. If you don't agree that's fine, if you think it's a 1/10 that's fine too. It's not a film meant for everyone.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The making of a falling legend!,"This should have been the title of the movie. This is by far... the best ""the making of"" film in movie history yet.For a character that is well known and one that everyone has an opinion off, no one definitely knows how this character came to being. This version of the character development is by far the best version so far, for so many reasons.For one. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in this role. He embodies the very essence of what the joker has been through, through the ages, to become who he is.The script and direction of this movie is brilliant. It even gives glimpse into the very reality of why the Gotham universe is the way it is. There are so many moments in this movie that makes one realise the universe of Gotham and Batman, Of why they lead to certain events.For those batman fans who grew up reading the comics... you're in for a real treat! The screenplay and direction is superb in telling a story of the joker that develops its roots of what makes him over the edge, while also dropping crucial points on what could influence the becoming of other characters. ... things a lot of us have never realised were even connected.I can't wait for batman now and I truly can't wait for the next time batman and joker meet in this universe created by Todd Phillips. Here's hoping they do, coz I truly can't wait to see the outcome knowing what I know now, about their becoming.This is truly a film not to miss, for those new to the genre but truly love movies of substance and character, and for those who truly love the Batman universe. Go watch it now!"

"The film shines a mirror on society, and society does not like what it sees.","There is so much that can be said about this spectacular film. Those who call it boring or dismiss it for being too violent are doing their best to quantify a piece of art they are not able to completely understand. Ennui only comes through disinterest and emotional/intellectual distance. The subtleties of Phoenix's performance to some, are undercut by his denial that he did not have to give himself to the role as much as previous Jokers have had to. People want a story of struggle and pain ending with high accomplishment. But the actor achieves this with skill and mastery of his craft. I'd watch the film again and again just to enjoy how Phoenix deftly makes be believe and empathise with a sociopath, a victim of circumstance in this interpretation.Brilliant cinematography and self-conscious homages to classic Scorsese masterpieces are testament to the wider scope Joker seeks to reach. The public seem so worried about how this film could incite violence and negative behaviour. My appreciation for the artistic calibre of this film resides it its ability to incite such controversy and opinion. Instead of shouting at the screen ask yourself why you feel the way you do and question your own tendencies rather than seek to project your insecurities on the world. What a film!"
Joaquin Phoenix IS Joker.,"There have been many a Joker - from live action adaptations and animated adaptations - and this one, by Joaquin Phoenix, is the best one next to Heath Ledger's Joker. With this film released late in the year, perhaps Phoenix is a shoo-in for Best Actor. An excellent character study of a man battling a plethora of mental illnesses. Also, for those who have seen this movie, one question remains: How much of the movie is rooted in reality, and how much of it is in Arthur Fleck's mind? It's difficult to differentiate reality from fantasy.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
most important message of tis time - better then Ledger?,"This movie is astonishing,
This movie managed to tie all loose ends. The outstanding acting makes the movie so much more believable and realistic, and every character is designed perfectly and have major role in the plot.
The camera shots in this film are perfect, mostly wide blurred shots slowly creeping in making it so much more disturbing.
Plot - This movie is so disturbing and gritty just as it should be, it shows what really can happen in life when a person with mental health issues or even a healthy person that has hit rock bottom and has no one to help them 'back' up.The message is perfect for the times we live in, in 2019, the rich and healthy should not be separated from the sick and poor; from the mentally challenged. We should live in a society where anyone can be helped and anyone can be heard no matter what level they stand at, before they spiral.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema.,"JOKER 2019Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Philips & Scott Silver's JOKER is the ULTIMATE punchline to the 'joke' called society. It is a bold, raw, devastating and hauntingly beautiful character study, a social commentary and a flawless masterpiece - a cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema. It unfolds very very slowly but as it does, it punches you in the guts, punches you hard.Let me go back to one and a half year or more ago when they announced the movie. Being a hardcore Joker fan, I wasn't overly excited as I knew (as did everyone) that it is not possible to outdo Heath Ledger's performance as Joker. I was still intrigued as I heard Martin Scorcese was involved and Joaquin Phoenix was cast as the role with Robert De Niro in it. I wanted that different, crime-driven version. Then, over the course of last 12 months LOTs and LOTs of leaked photos and behind-the-scenes footages came out, and I wasn't quite liking what I saw. The production team seemed lazy as per security and keeping secret, something someone like Christopher Nolan wouldn't do. Then I heard that the script was being rewritten almost every day (which is usually a recipe for disaster) and my expectations were further down and it wasn't even my most anticipated this year, then there was the matter of confidence on Director Todd Philips who directed the crime-driven comedy 'The Hangover'. THEN, the unexpected happened and we got to see the first trailer and the second. And then, last month, the reviews came in, the movie won an 8 minute standing ovation from Venice Film Festival screening and won the 'Golden Lion'. Some of the hardest reviewers gave it full marks and called it either a masterpiece, or a cinematic achievement, or that a comic book movie has never been done in such way, and this opens up new doors and changes the movie industry forever. Well....whatever you heard and read are all true.Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance that cannot be described in words, even if I talk about it in person I will fail to describe it. I have never seen any performance like this, and I watch a LOT of cinemas. He did something impossible to the character that left us all awestruck and in disbelief. His version of Joker is of course different (the greatness of Joker character is - it is multi layered and can be approached in different ways) but if I'd have to compare it, it goes on par with Heath Ledger's Joker or maybe even outshines him. If I consider the best actors (Oscar Winners) for the last few years namely, Matthew Mcconaughey, Mahershala Ali, or Rami Malek, they were all brilliant but Phoenix outshines them all (little known fact, Phoenix did almost all his shots in single takes :O). Joaquin Phoenix has BECOME Joker. My sincere gratitude to Todd Philips, as whatever rewrites and plans he did, it came out as a beautiful bright art. It took him a whole year to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight the movie and 5 visits to Joaquin Phoenix's house to convince him. His depiction of Gotham city is raw, filthy and perfect. Cinematography also is Oscar worthy and so is the story. Hildur Guðnadóttir's unforgettable score for the movie not only is a perfection but it almost literally talks to you during moments, especially during times when you're confused as to what is going on inside Arthur Fleck's (Joker) mind.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker will sadden you, cheer you, scare you, haunt you, and finally leave you scarred. Yes this movie is not for everyone and of course children should definitely avoid it. In the end, you will not know how much of it you can believe or was real, it leaves you to your imagination. So if you think this Joker has a definitive origin as opposed to Heath Ledger's mysterious Joker.....wrong, it leaves you to interpret it on your own way. When there is chaos we always try to point it all to someone, in JOKER though you wouldn't know whether you should point you finger to the society or Joker himself. When everything spirals out of control do you still endure it, or do you cross that thin line, or do you put a bullet through your head, what would YOU do given the same situation, because Arthur Fleck is one of us. Therein lies the mastery of the movie. During the final punchline of it you will roar as we all did - WE ARE ALL CLOWNS, LET'S PUT ON A HAPPY FACE.As Arthur would say ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, now I know it's a comedy"", apart from what this line represents, the final shot of the movie ends with a comedy. This movie will win multiple awards and Oscars as per my prediction and will be talked about for years. Indeed, one of the greatest cinematic achievement created with a $ 55 million budget. Don't wait for blu-ray, run to the theaters and believe me, it is worth every single penny of yours. This movie is disturbingly real, and relatable.I've seen it 3 times already and still stuck with the HAHAs in my head. I'm giving it a 10/10."
Still processing the movie (it's very good),Watched Joker in the cinema a couple of hours ago and am still processing it. It's not the movie you expect but rather way better than you would expect. You won't feel happy watching this movie as the story is about a struggling man. The acting and bizarre movement of Arthur is just perfect. This is a must watch as it will most likely make you feel the need to process what you just experienced.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

In the presence of true genius,"I left the theater stunned speechless. There really isn't an adequate way to describe Phoenix's genius portrayal of the Joker. I can say there were an abundance of moments when the hair on my arms literally stood up, moments when I could not breathe. See this movie for no other reason than to watch the mastery of his work. We will never meet or know a character like Joker, but Phoenix will bring you as close as you can be to true madness without losing your life. If he does not receive the Oscar for this role, it is only because of fear.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Send in the Clowns,"Scrolling down Instagram and Facebook you might come across this quote ""Put on a happy face"", ""Whenever happens you should smile"" and this quotes are the main theme of JOKER. The film begins with Arthur aka joker laughing and you can feel every emotion joker's laugh had except the emotion of happiness cause joker is not happy from inside and that's why he is going under 7 medications even though if it's not helping him. Acting - Acting is top notch, it's something you might have never seen before. Joaquin phoenix is quite old in age and that's why in close up you can see linings on his face and you can see how those linings make his laugh, and sadness more effective. With facial expressions there are macro expressions which you can notice on close up and those macro expressions shows the class of acting this guy has done. Music - Background music is top notch the song ""Send in the clowns"" fits perfectly with the theme and in some part the background score so perfect that it glorify the scene for example the scene where Arthur is checking his gun n there is this music played in TV shows which helps to intensify the mood. Makeup and lighting is even perfect after The dark knight if there's something everyone was talking the most after heath ledger's acting then it's his makeup. He himself did the makeup so it can be realistic and in this Joker makeup is good, simple, subtle and perfect according to the script, some small details makes you a fan of the make up artist like painting a kind of tear drop under the eye bags and at some places the right eye's blue colour is slightly spread because of joker's tears. The lighting makes you feel it's a 90's setting and dark film. Unpredictable storyline - Just like Spiderman far from home this film has lots of surprises for you and you cannot say what will happen next, anything can happen at any point and it is so balanced that you don't feel like there is too many surprises. The first half is quite slow but makes you feel pity over Arthur, the mental and laughing condition of Arthur and the way the people treats him makes you question about your way of treating people like that. The best thing of the film is it hasn't shown Joker has a hero they have shown him, it has shown him as a person who is the biggest villian of Batman and the reason behind his attitude. The film leaves the descision on you wheather what he is doing right or not and everything in the film is perfect and balanced and you cannot argue on that. If you like to see dark film and writes stories or you wanna be an actor then this is a must watch."

Loop Movie,"Well, this review will not contain any spoilers, although I must say, if you read it, just don't complain me for this poor society that we live in. This is, with absolutely no doubt, one of the movies of the century, one of the movies that has no precedent, just art, just a true show about the real downsides of this society, and still, humanity keeps failing, over and over again...I already know, that we (humans), don't have the same tastes, the same ideologies, and the same problems, but it's a bit shameful see the younger, just arguing (and with no real arguments whatsoever), that this movie is just boring, non interesting, and non relevant.Sometimes, we have to grow, to understand the real sadness, to understand the madness, the provocative world that we live in, but unfortunately some of the youngest have real problems, and I've already been there.For those who find this movie quite forgettable, just leave the cinema, and continue to see your favourite movies.For those, who can't get the job done (like, reading some info), before the movie session, try to do so on a future visit.Art is art. Madness is madness. And Joker is Joker."

Austerity in society hitting those most vulnerable.,"A brilliant use of current problems in capitalist societies, sheer the rich want to get even richer and so they demand governments and councils use austerity on the masses to fuel tax cuts for the rich.
One specific result is the cuts to services that help those with mental illness. Hence Joaquin Phoenix's character depends into an abyss from which the Joker emerges.
The dance sequence down the long set of steps to the Glitter Bands Rock and Roll (part 1 & 2), beats anything Fred Astaire could do.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this, then scrap the Oscars.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Phenomenal acting by Joaquin Phoenix makes this film A Masterpiece!,"Eversince Phoenix was attached to play the iconic Joker, I was eagerly waiting for this film. I had high expectations in terms of acting in the film and I was completely blown away after seeing it. This film is the best of the year and will be a cult classic in coming years. Direction is near perfect and cinematography is beautifully poetic as expected from a DC movie. You dive into the 80s Gotham and see the world through Arthur's eyes. You witness his transformation into the Joker and the reasons behind it. The end of the movie will make you think what's real and what's fantasy as they say joker has a multiple origin stories.

Deserve Oscar,"By far the best movie this year. This should be the starting story of creating the Joker. It's supposed to make a new movie where it relaxes that tension and creates a sick mind of something resembling the Heath ledger joker. Where he becomes a psychopath but leads a group of people off the street and is the most evil supervillain. This type of dancing smoke bomb, pistol and all those magician clown stuff that go with it.

A must see Drama\Thriller movie,"It's rare for me to give a movie 10 stars, but Joker is totally worth it.
It is a very strong drama movie that won't let you move your eyes for a second. the music and sounds affects are genius,
adding a lot to the general atmosphere - first when you get to know the Joker
and how everything is going horribly wrong.
It got to the part of the movie that there are supposedly comedy parts, but the director wants you to feel how it is wrong and not really funny.
The movie really make you get to know the joker's personality and creeps you out.

Can you combine a powerful story with a deep drama in a comic book movie?,"Normally, it helps me more to put DC or Marvel movies under a different category from other movies to be fair when I rate them, but this one was really on another level. A great script that gave us a deep story, well-organized chapters, superb acting performance and yes it was based on comics!
Even though it's a slow-paced movie, I didn't feel like there's a slow buildup in any chapters, which is not easy to avoid in these kinds of dark drama movies. Joaquin took the movie to another level, and it's really fair enough to say it's 'Joaquin's movie'. He really made every scene counted on the screen. I can't remember any scene was there just to help the story, not his character. Everything in the movie should be about him, and that's what he did.
When I watched the movie in the cinema, there were mixed emotions between the audience for most of the scenes. You don't know if you should laugh? or feel sad. These stressful situations were greatly made with the help of Joaquin's performance. He was always in control of these kinds of situations and when things require outsourcing support, the soundtrack comes in the right moment. Hildur made a great job by giving the soundtrack theme a character that I felt personally it's a little bit inspired by Hans Zimmer's masterpiece the Dark Knight, but with a more slow pace and dark feel.
I liked how during each chapter there were these scenes that look like some encaustic or painting to recap the joker personality changes.
Some people are saying the story is not 100% loyal to the comic, but what's wrong with that? Make a nice movie and implement all film success factors then I'm more than satisfied.
The only thing that I felt is not 100% complete after watching the movie for the second time is the last 20 min. I think it was necessary for an extra 15 or a maximum of 20 min for the last Joker personality transformation. But maybe the writer wanted to focus on what things that made the Joker as he is instead of the Joker himself. So yeah it's fine.
I know there are obvious ideas that can be reflected in other ones in the Taxi Driver movie, but it's really been used brilliantly. If someone watched the two movies and focused on the last Joker chapter, he will understand why I'm saying that.
It's really hard - without considering the comics' loyalty thing - to not give this film a full mark. It's been years since I watched a deep movie like this one.
I had a big question after I finished the movie, what's wrong in having a good script that leaves the freedom for actors to give a stunning performance in superhero movies? What's wrong with a good deep story instead of just counting on CGI? A lot of people are really starving for a well-written drama superhero movie. I hope Joker can help in this direction."

Oscar-worthy and Movie of the Decade,"This movie is truly a modern masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does justice to Joker where Heath Ledger left off. But I wouldn't want to compare both their performances as many have already said, ""It would be like comparing apples to oranges."" But I at least know that Heath Ledger can rest easy in heaven knowing Joaquin brought the character under a new light with his phenomenal performance. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really outdone themselves with this new take on The Joker. Joaquin and Todd bring a whole new aspect to Joker that has never really been talked about before, tackling the issue and importance of mental illness and a few other problems with modern society. And to address all the fear-mongering the media throws towards this movie, ignore it. Most of it isn't even relevant towards the actual movie and much of it are lies. I couldn't recommend another movie to watch over Joker. This movie will not disappoint. In fact, it goes above expectations (surely went over mine). Case in point, please consider giving this film a watch. I can't recommend this movie enough.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Crazy Good Story,"Joker was not only a fantastic story that was filled with emotion and intensity, it also portrayed mental illness as something that should be taken care of in the real world. When you watch Joker he does all these crazy things in the movie but the story isn't necessarily telling us to forgive him for his acts but more or less understanding him for what he did.The story was so well put with emotion and heart breaking agony for the main character and joker made it seem as if he couldn't take it anymore. Phoenix took his acting to a whole other level for this film and him and this film definitely deserves an Oscar6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Must watch if you like character study films or find mental illnesses fascinating.,"It's very interesting to watch a talented actor depict a compelling and unique character falling into madness. This kind of movie heavily depends on the actor's performance so I was worried if Joaquin could pull it off, but he really exceeded my expectations.One of those movies that I couldn't get enough of after watching it, don't think I'll get easily tired of discussing about the it and watching clips or the whole thing again.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A hug,"I did not find a single scene that I did not like, the photography in this movie is excellent. I cried in the beginning, I only laughed 3 or 4 times (no forced jokes) and i left the cinema complete. You see the side b of gotham's past and although you can empathize with Arthur but only the politically correct thing could complain about such a jewel, it bothers them but we love it.

Who's laughing now?,"Modern America is like Murray show where opinions are created for greater masses & every difference is looked upon with contempt. Such is mindless campaign to boycott a movie because it will provoke violence in a country where gun can be bought while shopping for groceries.Joker is examination of people's behavior towards those in need, sick individuals who are pushed to the margins just because they need help. While city is choking in garbage, funds are being cut on social help & medical care, elite in suits are smiling while watching Chaplin. Wayne is not different then the others and he's finally given human approach rather then all good hero that tried to save Gotham in all other creations.There are no heroes in this movie, there is no light at the end of tunnel & there is no sympathy for titular character but rather a big punch in the face from Todd Phillips to all of us who are actually living in our own Murray show day in day out without ever taking time to reflect what surrounds us.Joker is a must see movie that will make you think about times we live in, about our role in the system & the ones on top never liked ordinary thinking people. Burton took his Joker straight from comics as he fell in acid, but Phillips only needed to put his protagonist in today's world.So who's laughing now?"
A MUST WATCH!! One of the best movies of all-time,"""you are making fun of it, but it was serious to me""dem this scene still gives me chills since last night.
its rare to spot a good thriller with a decent suspense and ending nowadays, guess Christopher Nolan has raised the bar too high.but maaaan, Joaquin and Todd have just proved me wrong, Joker wasn't just great, but motha-****ingly AMAZING. The performance, cinematography, screenplay, storyline, music etc were absolutely stunning. It's not just a movie but also a whistleblower, a HUGE message to the world out there of what's still going on in our society.you can't compare Joaquin to Heath, they are both Ronaldo and Messi. If Joaquin doesn't win the Oscar and Joker doesn't win AT LEAST the best screenplay, it'll be the biggest joke of all time.Joker is something else."

"There are many cinematic classics that I cherish, but I have NEVER had as visceral of a reaction to watching a movie as I did with 'Joker'.","There are many cinematic classics that I cherish, but I have NEVER had as visceral of a reaction to watching a movie as I did with 'Joker'. It has grown on me tremendously to become my personal all-time favorite film.I remember being absolutely mesmerized by this movie from the very first frame--it shocked me and left me in awe. After my first viewing, I actually had mixed feelings about the film because it's so hard to watch at times, I thought it was something that you appreciate seeing once but would never want to sit through again. But afterwards, I couldn't get the film out of my mind and when I found that just listening to the musical score was enough to bring back the intense emotions I felt during the film, I knew I had to watch it again, which I have never done in theaters before.I absolutely fell in love with the movie my second time watching it because I was able to fully appreciate the incredible acting, cinematography, score, and everything else that went to crafting this beautiful film. I have rewatched it numerous times since then, but experiencing this film for the first and second time was truly something else...Not everyone reacted to this movie on this level, of course, and it's possible that you will simply like this movie or even dislike it. But that was just my personal reaction."
"I liked him before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved a Joker!","Nothing short of what I expected. Hands down the best psychological drama ever made, as best as I recall seeing. I never thought that The Joker could be the hero, that would pretty much make everyone else the villains, but it does happen! He does it! Monumental performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Honestly I thought the script would be brilliant, but it's just about good enough, he makes it seem brilliant! Or maybe JP just embodies perfectly the vision of the screenplay writer, and they're both equally good! I've seen it in something akin HDrip and enjoyed every moment of this movie and I await the Blu Ray release so I can enjoy it again, in more detail!The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you'd be too much of a child or too stupid for it, as it has the most substance a movie can have, by a fu*king continental drift from the lot! It may be my favorite movie ever, but I have to see it a few more times to be certain! I give it good chances though, I liked him before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved a Joker!"
A work of art and I do not say that lightly,"The acting, the music, the cinematography, the themes - I could gush for hours about the sheer amount of breath taking QUALITY in this film. If you like good cinema you will like this.""Joker"" stands as one of the most left wing films I have ever seen that persuasively validates left wing theory, which is funny because they are the ones attacking it without having seen it! Cancel culture is stupid isn't it?I felt the crushing weight and pressure of a cold society that did not care about the working class and that favored the elite. I saw a lonely human being kicked until he decided enough was enough and that resistance was not only the best way, but the only way forward.I never felt more revved up to ""fight the power"" and give the middle finger to a corrupt system than after seeing the Joker!The movie doesn't glorify shootings or vigilante justice so much as it makes it clear that if you take away options for people and treat them like they don't matter and don't exist then rebellion and riots WILL HAPPEN. It isn't so much a threat as an inevitability. People need to feel like the game isn't rigged against them to want to play.The way to fix society is to reach out to others more, to be more kind, and to fix the broken corrupt system that lacks humanity and only cares about money.The Joker is a hero for those who society deems garbage and worthless. In the movie there is a protester holding a sign that symbolizes modern-day society and it's connection to this movie perfectly: We are all clowns."

Heath Ledger Would've Loved This!,"I consider Joker another masterpiece. Brilliant storyline, outstanding direction and writing by Todd Philips, staggeringly suspenseful score, vivid cinematography and above all, Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing and sublime performance as the Joker. I was speechless with astonishment by the end of this film. To reiterate, Heath Ledger would've loved this masterpiece; I wish he was still alive today. Joaquin Phoenix's embodiment of an ordinary man who gradually transforms into Gotham's most mercurial, menacing, and diabolical criminal through his mentality and despair caused by rejection and humiliation from society was a central pillar of this film. In my experience, I was seeing Joker, not Joaquin Phoenix, for the entire movie through his erratic behavior, abnormal laughter, and irresistible dance moves. He has once again proven himself an extraordinary actor. The suspenseful score complements the dark theme as it strongly implies Arthur Fleck's imminent downfall. Although the ending was quite intense, I truly consider this as an Oscar-worthy movie that deserves the utmost recognition.9 out of 17 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Thought-Provoking Masterpiece!,"Joker is a drama movie in the vein of movies like Taxi-Driver and King of Comedy, It is a horror movie without any jump-scares or any other horror movie tropes and it is a comic-book origin movie about the most notorious and iconic villain. This movie will make you uncomfortable very often but ultimately it will force upon you some difficult questions that most movies shy away from asking. This is one of the few comic-book movies which will force you to think for hours after you have seen it.Joker is a movie about Arthur Fleck (played brilliantly by ""Joaquin Phoneix"") who had some psychopathic tendencies but due to deteriorating conditions of Gotham and certain events that took place in the span of the movie leads him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as Joker. The movie in its 2-hour runtime focuses completely on Arthur Fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well showcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. The main credit goes to Joaquin Phoneix for such brilliant acting definitely Oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may feel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the darkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. The rest of the supporting casts were great as well especially Robert De Niro.The movie is directed by Todd Philips who before this had only directed movies like Hangover and Due date. This movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could tell he is a big Scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver this movie is a bit of a slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially since this movie was a character study. As the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.The cinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating Gotham and characters. The soundtrack of the movie was also very good again I think it was very similar to Taxi Driver, It wasn't omnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.I am really glad that a movie like this exists. When comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these. Projects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. You may not end up liking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. Having said that I really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful cinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take."

The same studio that made Batman vs Superman made this masterpiece,"This is a phenomenal movie with a great story that leaves you to question who's right or wrong and what's real or not, amazing and haunting music, uncomfortable and scary moments but there very well done, beautifully made, and of course Joaquin Phoenix giving a jaw dropping performance. All the other actors do good as well (Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, etc.) but it's Joaquin is what holds the movie together and he totally deserves his Oscar for best actor (Hildur guonadottir Also deserves her Oscar for best original score).

Aren't we in the world of clowns?,"What we are seeing is the widening wealth gap, the high concentration of political and economic power and cultural power in televisions; the failure of thorough communication between people in the run-down cities, and the already miserable underlying society. Cruel mutual harm. If the patterning of these background details is mild and still interacts to a certain degree with the protagonist, then the most vivid social description in the film is highly rigid. The bottom group, with clowns as the cultural banner, was able to raise their arms in search of equality at first, but was later presented as the ""Wuhe people"" which is most easily understood in the patchwork.5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Believe the Hype!!,"When i read people's reaction saying don't believe the hype or the character doesn't stay true to the comics, i would say that, those people are the ones that do not understand what this movie is trying to do.
This is not a comic book adaptation of the joker story, this is a story of a the downfall of a human being who falls into madness because of all the bad stuff that he experiences in his life while all he wants is to be accepted by society.
The story is well written and the acting of Joaquin phoenix is just out of this world, its that good.
To see an actor so determined to make his character believable for the adience is amazing and fascinating to watch and he deserves all the credit for his oscar winning performance.
For me this is a true masterpiece, one wich we don't see to often anymore.
If you expect to see a comic book, action loaded, super hero/villain movie then you will be dissapointed but if you on the other hand are interested in a psychological drama and want to know how a person can become so estranged from the normal world and turns into a character that despite him being totally imsane, you actually care and respect the him and understands why he does what he does then you are in for a treat because this is truly a mesmerising experience, that you will remember for a long time.
A true modern day masterpiece and an excellent milestone in movie makingA massive 10/10 for me"
AN INSTANT CLASSIC & A MASTERPIECE OF CINEMA & A FILM I CAN TOTALLY RELATE TOO!!!,"WOW!!! ""JOKER"" what can be said that hasn't already?
It's an instant CLASSIC & a true masterpiece of cinema with one of the greatest performances in cinema history too from the incredible JOAQUIN PHOENIX & another great performance from the legendary Robert De Niro!!!
This movie i can relate to & i think lots of people will to, it's a powerful film & I've felt like how he feels & mental illness is an extremely hard thing to live with especially in a cold dark & nasty world like it is!!!!
A mesmerising movie!!!
The music was fantasticly moody & the cinematography was outstanding & captured the old fashioned gritty, grimy & crime infested & decaying Gotham city of 1981!!!
This Brilliant movie was part Psychological Drama & part Dark Crime Thriller, it was a mesmerising viewing & pretty much incredible in every single way!!!
I got vibes of old school greats such as Charles Bronson's 1974 Urban vigilante Thriller DEATH WISH, I also felt vibes from Martin Scorsese's 1976 Physiological Vigilante Thriller TAXI DRIVER & I'm sure there's other's that felt similar in look & story.
I felt ""Joker"" really did feel like a movie made in the 70's or very early 80's as that much care was MADE in the details & grimy urban tuxture of every location, i felt dirty just watching it & that's how well crafted & expertly made this Masterpiece was.Joaquin Phoenix is Phenomenal as Arthur Fleck the struggling Comedian with an extremely sad & horrific past, he also suffers really bad with his mental health & has a condition of severe laughter when nervous or upset, it's an astonishing performance a raw piece of acting on screen that is shocking & full of realism!!!
This movie felt real & feels like it can happen & has happened & will happen as it's darkness & themes are so relevant today...now!!!
I totally enjoyed this modern masterpiece & totally agree with all the huge praise this got & the awards it won. Truly OUTSTANDING piece of filmmaking that made me feel emotional & sorry for what Arthur has gone through in his terrible life but also how he goes isn't the best way but again it's totally understandable & i bet his actions will continue debate for years!!! A stone cold gritty Classic"
Best betrayal of the joker dare i say better that heath himself,"Ive watched this film twice now and it still impresses me from start to finish Joaquin Phoenix done amazing from the weight loss to the laugh and the way the joker should be betrayed a man who doesnt fit in socitey with it keep breaking and bringing him down for him to finally loose it, so happy he got the Oscar for this5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Favorite,"Joker is easily one of the best movies I've ever watched in my entire life.Phoenix's performance is beast, not to mention the music, the story, the emotional impact.It questions us as a society. Nobody cared about Arthur and we felt bad about it, would we have cared about Arthur? Do we care about the Arthurs out there?
Arthur became the Joker because somehow the society he lived in led him down that path, and we as a society and the way the system works do the exact same with millions of people.It made me question even myself and my ethics.Wonderful!5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Don't ignore this film, you need it.","To put it plainly, this feels like a masterpiece but it isn't really yet still it moves like one. To have a movie about a character in a comic book world portray a message so important in the real world and almost necessary makes this somewhat A- yet masterfully directed and acted movie a masterpiece. 10 out of 10 for me and I will dare again and call it a masterpiece. Its view may scar you but more so it will make you wonder how much possible it is.5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

So Brilliant I Can't Stop Talking About It,"I don't like violent films and I don't like comic books and comic book characters. That being said, I LOVED ""Joker""--as a former New Yorker, I loved the ""mood"" and lighting of this film's ""city,"" the ""characters"" you will only find in this crazy place, the lifestyle and intensity and madness that doesn't exist anywhere else on the planet and only really exists if you yourself are living somewhat on the edge. It's Bellevue and St. Vincent's and The Pyramid Club and every seedy street corner from ""Law and Order SVU"" rolled into one. Joaquin Phoenix is SO brilliantly uncomfortable you might check yourself in just to make sure you are still relatively the same person you were before you agreed to see this film.5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joker Gets In Your Head & Never Leaves,"Joker's like getting in a time machine and going back to 1983 and watching a movie that was made without modern restraints to be thought provoking & entertaining, definitely NOT made to be PC, LGBT or appeal specifically to the Chinese or any minority. Joker was made for all mankind. The bought and paid for mainstream media critics will hate Joker, but true film fans will leave having seen something unapologetically original and unimaginably enjoyable.

A movie so unlike the movies of today. Truly a Masterpiece.,"This ain't no ordinary superhero movie. Never have I expected to tear up watching a movie especially in this day and age. The writing and character development is done extremely well, have I ever feel the pain The Joker goes through in this life. How his relation of his surroundings I compare to my relations with leftists elites like Silicon Valley and corrupt governments of western Europe to nihilists who infest the western world. That feel of wanting to change absolutely everything and how satisfying it would feel if you've actually achieve this stance of changing the landscape around you. Albeit my goals are a permanent renaissance, A permanent nirvana for the shreds of sanity of humanity, being the innocent ones, the ones unlike the ignorant normies and the scummy elitists who tear the world apart. Never have I expected a movie made in recent times have I ever felt shocked or uncomfortable in a good way. A movie to really inspire me especially at this magnitude is extremely hard to come across. Like The Matrix, it should really get you to grasp on an extremely interesting perspective of the world. A movie to really challenge you on what you perceive in life. This is one epic masterpiece if I've ever seen one."
Deeply disturbing and brutal,"This film is far removed from the comic book capers one would initially expect. There is no superhero action sequences here. This is a psychologically thrilling yet disturbingly shocking version of The Joker, maybe a character study if you will.There is no falling into chemical waste in this movie; what you get here isn't a physical destruction of the character but a mental one. This could be a film of The Joker's psyche rather than his story.Phoenix's portrayal is nothing short of amazing. At times I felt like he may have tried too hard, but regardless this is an award winning performance and it's clear that he has thrown everything into this character both mentally and physically.Coupled with a beautiful soundtrack and amazing photography and direction this is a true masterpiece.Personally I'd rate this as the best entrant into the Gotham City universe so far. To follow this going to be insanely difficult.A movie that is, at times, cringeworthy yet still keeps you mesmerised. This is a sickly sweet, brutal and deeply dark and disturbing film. There is no good versus evil here; there is only pure evil. This franchise has finally come of age."
Outstanding,"As an avid movie watcher, I can't help but get bothered by the amount of people comparing the jokers from the latest film to the one in Dark Knight. Let me first clear the fact that I think Heath Ledger's performance in the dark knight set the bar extremely high for anyone that was to play the role again, this was clear from the miserable attempt by Jared Leto in suicide squad.The joker in the latest instalment is about how he became the joker and the revelations of his childhood trauma and mental illness, it's the back story to everything you've ever seen about a joker. It is stupidly wrong for anyone to compare him to the Joker from the dark knight, where we see a matured chaotic version, a finished product more or less.This movie was not supposed to tell you a story with a begging middle and end, it doesn't have a very sold narrative nor it's supposed to be a fast paced watch. There's nothing wrong with that and I honestly don't think that's what they were going for. It portrays his existing struggle with his illness, his failed career aspirations and the harshness of the society he's in. The movie is about him and him only, the uprising of the joker everyone knew before this movie.If you're still bothered by the story then let the cinematography and sounds effects sink in for a moment.My final opinion is about the acting, it is one of the most original and convincing roles I've ever seen in a film, every move combined with his body language, tone and that horrific laughter captured my attention, which gave me goosebumpsIf Heath Ledger was alive today, he'd most certainly be proud of Joaquin's acting"
Best Since the Dark Knight,"One of the best films since the Dark Knight trilogy came out. So incredibly profound that I left the theater appreciating it more and more as I couldn't stop thinking about all the subtleties in the script and acting that made it perfect. I've never seen another movie like it. Going to see it again soon and will buy the blu-Ray when it's released. I had high expectations and it exceeded them. Do not listen to the critics and do not think ""it's just hype"" go see it for your self and see how incredible this masterpiece truly is.5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

One of the greatest Masterpieces ever ?,"When I sat to watch the Joker , I was anxious because as a person I do not like comic book movies . It's just my taste . I really don't find those movies so important because most of the times , they do not transmit a message . However , my opinion changed when I viewed the Joker . Personally , I do not think that this movie is a comic book one . It is a drama that shows the tragic life of an ordinary individual , who is disregarded by the society around him . From a specific point of view , you feel sorry for him and you really want to blame the rich and powerful who have created a societal trap that helps them achieve their personal goals while ordinary people suffer every day . From another perspective however , you are scared and terrified by his reaction to all this misery that society brings to him . That's what this movie perfectly does . It creates a story that is split in two subjective realities . The distorted reality of Arthur Fleck that is influenced greatly by his mental illness and the reality through the eyes of the common people that blame his actions . It is a story that depends on how the viewer wants to see it . But I think that the story really shows the life of a man who did the wrong things and reacted in a psychopathic way to his problems , partly because of his mental illness and partly because of the pressure that was created by the environment around him . It is a story that does not justify this guy , but also does not accuse him . It just shows us that we , as a whole , sometimes create a Joker , without often realising it . So , for me it is a presentation of the two sides of the same story , those of an unstable and poor individual in a cruel dystopian city that does not care for people like him and those of the people with common sense . Additionally , it wants to tell people that they should take care of men and women who have mental problems and they should fight for a better world that does not treat the unprivileged so harshly as it does ."

Brilliant,"Simply awesome.By no means a super hero or super villain type of movie. This chronicles one mans decent into insanity. It is grim, relentless, sad and utterly compelling. A damming indictment on how mental health issues are dealt with. Dismissed, mocked or simply ignored.In this story we are shown what happens when such an individual, finally, screams enough is enough. Down trotten, rejected by society and held up to endless ridicule, the Joker when he finally emerges is simply terrifying. His very public outing will go down in cinema history as it is memorising, disturbing and truly believable.There is talk of Oscars for this performance and it is absolutely merited, Joaquin Phoenix simply nailed this part. This is not a popcorn, switch off the brain and watch the action movie. It takes the viewer into the darkest, most distressing thing there is, our own mind.Brilliant movie."
What a remarkable insight into those who suffer from mental illness.,"This movie was sensational.
The actors, the cinematography and most importantly the insight into mental illness and it's victims.
There is such a stigma towards mental illness and watching this movie really highlights some of the reasons that an individual may develop a mental illness, and how someone's childhood and upbringing can effect mental health throughout there entire life.
The joker had serious trauma throughout his childhood, and it came to surface in adult hood as you can see in the movie.
The build up of the movie from start to finish was very intense and overwhelming.
It highlights the stigma people can have towards mental illness and should be an eye opener for those who are too quick to judge people.
Sensational movie. I would recommend this to anybody. Huge thumbs up.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

This movie is no Joke,"Thinking to Joker it is a haunting, beautiful film that shines in it's brutality. Not in terms of the violence, but more along the lines of witnessing one man's journey into madness. Each event, each action provides a great amount of weight along with an unease factor.Joaquin Phoenix's performance was phenomenal and you can feel the heartbreak along with the mental strain that continously pushes him into a dark mind set.The grittier nature of Gotham, combined with the beautiful score really help sets the mood, and the songs from Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante adds whole another of class in midst of the slums. The Cinematography manages to catches the beauty, and the despair of a Gotham city that is falling apart, not too mention that the score and licensed songs help add another layer to the film.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

An amazing collaboration- Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really done it!,"This was the first DC movie that I actually paid attention to and paid money to see. I did go into the cinema with high expectations after watching the teaser for the film. Already, Joaquin Phoenix had astonished me with his talent. It was within the first 10 minutes of the movie that had captured me.It is clear that writer, producer and director Todd Phillips should be credited for this as he kept the audience hooked from the beginning till the end.The way in which Arthur Fleck's life was portrayed was truly amazing storytelling and really took the audience to new lengths in explaining his real life story. Interestingly, Todd Phillips uses the struggling society and city of Gotham to reflect the physical and mental state of Arthur. In doing so, he explained contemporary anxieties and how society's actions impact our lives in terms of behaviour and how it makes us who we really are.From a young age, we are taught that there are heroes and villains. We are always told that the hero needs to defeat the villain and shouldn't be questioned because it is for the ""greater good"". However, we never really stopped to think why it is we have heroes and why we have villains in this world. Instead, we're immediately taught that villains correspond to being evil- that a villain should be punished by a hero. However, after watching the life story of Arthur fleck, is it actually correct to call him a ""villain""?Should someone who has been so badly treated by a toxic society be labelled as a villain? Isn't it true of nature for someone to cry when they are upset? To laugh when told a joke? Actions do have consequences. This is simply the same way it is for Arthur fleck to criticise his society for kicking him when he was down- for pushing him away when he wanted him- for refusing to put on a happy face when all he wanted to do was to be truly happy when society didn't let him.So yes, Arthur may have done some things that make him fall under the category of a ""villain"", but who is the true villain?- him or society?After continuously being beat down and trampled on by society, Arthur fleck began consultation where he would receive medication and ""support"" from a therapist. In this way, it could be said that the medication Arthur was given, may have made his condition worse eg: depression/ anxiety. Aside from this, Arthur had a therapist who would simply ""read lines from a script"" instead of listening and actually helping him. This is part of the major issue in society whereby the people who are vulnerable and needy are pushed away by those who have power, even if it is only a little bit. People like Arthur are neither seen, nor heard and the only time they will be - when they do something that goes against the ""rules of society"" because ""putting on a happy face"" doesn't work for everyone.As the film progresses, Arthur is taken off the very little support he will have been given and stripped from his job. With nothing left, Arthur began hallucinating and suffering from psychosis- believing that things were real when they actually weren't- developing negative thoughts. All he has is ""negative thoughts"".Moving onto the acting in this movie...Joaquin Phoenix as the lead role was a brilliant decision made by Todd Phillips and other casting directors. It is vital that that a role such as JOKER should be played correctly, without a single fault- especially after Heath ledger's Oscar winning performance. Joaquin was nothing short of excellent. Utter perfection. Not a single fault in his acting. From breaking out into laughter to playing an emotionally and mentally wrecked character- Phoenix mastered it all. An Oscar Win is essential and exactly what he deserves. Every moment, every word spoken and every frame that was shot was done to perfection.By Saniya Khan

For those who gave out score under 10,"This is not a normal superhero movie where you will expect glamorous CG. But it definitely gives you more thrill and excitement than the other superhero movie. A smile, a bully, a setback, a betray, a misunderstanding, a confusion, a lie, a chance, these are what life makes of. Anyone who gave out score lower than 9 repeatedly reported the lack of excitement from the movie, that's because you guys are lack of life experience to feel so.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Unbelievably perfect,"Very rarely now it seems does a movie even leave you feeling like it was a worthwhile investment of your time. More often now films are regurgitated storylines, reboots, or an attempt at something new that feels like it shouldn't have been done. Even more rare now is a movie that leaves an impact on you long after you see it. Joker is just that.Granted there is a lot of hype with this movie and an equal number of ""professional"" critics who clearly think it's cooler for them to say this is a terrible movie so that it makes them feel elite over the common moviegoers. With that said, this movie is absolutely perfect and how anyone cannot say that after seeing it clearly doesn't have what it takes to appreciate such raw talent of acting, writing, direction, cinematography, and music.The entire film feels so intentionally and intensely dark, awkward and real that it make you feel the sanity slipping from Arthur's grasp. Phoenix's acting challenges that of even Ledger's Joker and does so through mastering the smallest physical gestures and expressions that make the character feel more real than ever. From the way he runs, dances, stares and smiles it feels 100% authentically Joker.The movie does a great job incorporating elements of the Batman series that fans will enjoy but makes this a completely stand alone movie. For anyone worried that they might not get it because they don't follow Batman, no worries, you won't be disappointed. The storyline does a fantastic job of ""producing"" the Joker, giving him slow building reason behind the madness that feel authentic rather than corny. The incorporation of Pseudobulbar Affect disorder, and even the way it's initially presented and the character's ongoing struggle with it throughout, to explain for and add the maniacal laughter is genius. The childhood trama mixed with current personal and social issues with a desire to fit in makes for compelling reasons to believe this is happening rather than a supervillain being born from being picked on.The entire movie is dark. And that's an understatement. Like Requiem for a Dream level dark. And the story feels like Taxi Driver, V for Vendetta, and American Psycho crammed together inside a Dark Knight costume. All of this is done completely right in every aspect from lighting and angles, to interesting intermittent scenes to add more to the development of the story and character, to perfect camera angles, shots and editing, to intense and properly chosen music. I guess my only criticism is the casting of De Niro. Let's face it, he's not a good actor and we're all just kinda going along with him because he's ""one of the greats"". Earlier in his career and in some roles sure. But not now and not as a funny late night talk show host. But... it's not terrible and they make it work but better casting could have been done rather than relying on a big name.This movie is one that will go down for me as one of the best I've ever seen. I left the theater wanting to buy another ticket and go back in to make the experience last. Very few movies now make you feel something. Even fewer do it this well."
A masterpiece,"This is one of those once in a lifetime movies that will make you move uncomfortably in your seat. You want to chear for him, you understand how he got to where he is, but your logic and morals don't let you connect. Truly a masterpiece, and fantastic acting.

People Severely Missunderstand What This Movie Is About,"Joker is a film about a man's transformation from the mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck to the widely-known villain Joker. This seems straightforward enough, but there are much deeper messages in this movie that apply not just to this fictional universe, but to our real world.
Arthur is a man who has been beaten down by not just society but fate itself time and time again. He has been dealt, for lack of a better term, a s*** hand and no one in his life seems to truly want to help him. He is a man that truly is alone in society, learning throughout the film how true that statement really is.
While the actions committed by him are definitely wrong, we understand him and can even somewhat empathize with him (hopefully we can, I may just be weird). Unlike how some people like to suggest, this movie doesn't glorify the violence that Arthur causes. This movie shows how horrible people can be created by the environment they are living in. We are living in a time where we like to blame the violence around us on the insane people who start it. Shootings are happening more than ever, and the insane gunman is responsible for it.
Of course, it cannot be denied that the gunman is at fault. There is clearly something wrong with the people who do these things. However, much too few people think, ""Why is this happening?"", ""Why are these people doing the things they do, and how can we stop them from doing this?"" We see the result of what happens when an at risk individual doesn't get the help he needs in this movie. What we need is a system that can actually help these people.
The movie Joker differs from other comic book movies because it is not only grounded in reality, but it's messages can be directly applied to our world. People like Arthur Fleck, people who have been brutally beaten by life at every turn need a way to be helped. The rich and successful don't care about these people. These people are viewed as threats instead of who they really are: humans, just like everyone else. We need to create an outlet where these individuals can get the actual support they need, not stuff them with medication and let specialists with their own agendas pretend to care about them.
Another argument I've seen about this movie is that it has no reason for existing. It shows violence and shows a unique portrayal of a popular character but it has no substance to it. As you can probably tell, I strongly disagree with anyone who believes this, and I truly believe anyone who thinks this completely missed the point of the entire movie.
In conclusion, this movie definitely has substance and doesn't glorify violence in the slightest. This movie brings up an issue in our society that we have been neglecting for far too long. There's a stigma about mentally ill people that we have to get over. People who have been neglected and have nothing left to lose are the most dangerous type of people, and the problem with our society is that we allow people to feel as if they have nothing left to lose. Arthur Fleck is just a person who never got any sign at all that he was needed or loved by society, or anyone for that matter. He is truly, as cliche as this may sound, a product of his environment. You can criticize this movie for being too dark but by doing so you're just dismissing the reality we live in."
Best Joker Origin Movie,"Amazing Acting , plot , directing everything is perfect .
one of the best joker origin movie8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Best comic book inspired movie, ever","The depth to which Joaquin Pheonix plays Joker is actually disturbing. This Joker is so very different than the gold standard Heath Ledger. In Heath's Joker, we feel unpredictable and scared or terrified, but Joaquin potrays a Joker which isn't as terrifying but it's downright eerie, disturbing and unnerving. It makes you sympathize with Joker, the most despicable character in comic universe, and makes you wanna help him. It doesn't make you justify Joker's choices but it will make you understand them, and by the end you will want to justify Arthur's actions, not Joker's but Arthur's. You wouldn't be able to justify them but you will have a hard time to condemn them. Also the story leaves you at an uncertain point open to any interpretation, just like the charachter and the comics it has drew inspiration from. It is a mind boggling, thorough, disturbing and unnerving charachter study that makes you question not only society but yourself too.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Perfection.,"Watching this film was fantastic, you were so immersed in it and everything that happend had some real impact, to some even, relatable problems. The music was fantastic, the atmosphere was good and the way Arthur tries to be positive and find solace and happiness, everything is only made worse by lies, no help, no friends no nothing.The reason for why for me it is a 10/10 is because i've been in a similar situation before, no friends, don't know how to get help or what to do. Sometimes these simple problems cause the worst of epidemics, ex: violence, mass shootings, suicides and so on.This movie is pretty much a fantastic depiction of mental illness and ""society"".

"What do you get when you cross a brilliant actor, a meaningful movie and the best supervillain in comics?","The feelings that this movie brings on you are really hard to describe, and it takes a while to swallow completely. Its dark and enters in morality and realistic topics, criticizing the way that society works, how most people see the mental illness and how an economic crisis can afect someone. Joker isn't a monster without feelings, he is a creation of a broken world, a broken Gotham City.
The most amazing part of the film is that they put you in the mind of Arthur Fleck, in a lot of scenes which there is a conflict between Humor, Tension and Fear. Out of nowhere you find yourself and others laughing at a terrible scene, just like the Joker would, and there is nothing you can do about it.
The development of the protagonist is well distributed and it works. His laughs which were once impulsive and uncontrolled turns into a coordenated and at the same time chaotic aspect of the personality of Arthur. I really think that Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job and deserve at least an indication to the Oscars, being pessimistic.And answering the title of the review:
I tell you what you get, you get the best movie of comics ever made!"

The start of something very special indeed...,Possibly the best comic book character depiction ever put into film. You feel the transition coming through every scene in the film and the wait is amazingly worth it when the joker finally arrives. The scene on the steps when he's become the joker was spine tingling because you realise this really is the Joker that your watching in the flesh. If this is the only version of Phoenix as the joker I'll have to accept it but if they can replicate this quality into a sequel it will be spectacular.

For the first time ever I will be returning to cinema to watch this again,"I admit it. I did not expect much from this film. But my god It was a nice surprise! Positives is by far the transformation of joker from start of the film to the end. It's incredibly dark and probably too distressing for some people to watch. The violence happens now and then but each time makes a huge impact! The negatives are obvious the main one being of course the late heath ledger, he left quite a high bar to jump! I personally believe phoenix matches him and does jump that bar. People just need to realise this is a different actors approach and different take on a character from a different universe. The second negative is the one that got to me the most. I personally believe part of jokers charm is no one has a clue who he is where he's come from or how he got them scars. I did eventually accept the origin story of course and I ask other hardcore comic book fans to do the same. As once you pass this hurdle this does become one of the best films ever. I will be returning to the cinema to watch this again which Is a first for me.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A Masterpiece,"From the moment I watched the trailer I was intrigued by the portrayal of this Joker. I loved that they created a backstory for this villain, it made him human. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, his performance throughout was astonishing, from contorting his body, to dancing, his glance very strong. I also loved the choice of his outfit (and colours) when dancing down the stairs, just perfect. The music, journal writings and silences were powerful.

Simply brilliant,"I would like to start this review by pointing out the fact that everything in this movie is just amazing, from the cast & crew members to the acting and to the story itself. Many people believed that this would just be another Marvel-like movie, but it was nothing like that. Todd did an excellent job in telling this character's story in such a unique way that it makes you want more. The way that he told the story of this worldwide known character is something amazing. The cinematography itself was simply astonishing. Troughout the movie there were some amazing shots that just took your breath away.
Joaquin's acting in this picture was just out of this world. The way that he portraied Joker's character was something to learn from. He put his whole heart in this particular role and you could easily see it while watching the movie. He made you fall in love with the character, although he is a villain. Even the dancing scenes took my breath away as he did such an amazing job in this area too. He truly deserves an Oscar for this outstanding performance.
I truly believe that this is one of the best character studies there ever were. It is one of those movies that make you want to see it again and again without getting bored of it. It makes you want more. Todd made such a good job by bringing awareness to mental health issues
to the world and although this movie has its range of bad reviews, it still makes you understand how the society truly works these days.
To conclude, this is and exceptional movie and i totally recommend it with all my heart. You will not regret it!"

The best Joker origin film.. ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,"A well crafted film with a more realistic approach on the comic book villain joker. The movie takes everyone to the 80's environment with the amazing cinematography, costumes and set design. Joaquin Phoenix is the only actor who could perform this iteration of Joker to the perfection. The movie is great and will be a cult film because it took a realistic approach by showcasing who Arthur Fleck is, and what makes him to be the joker. There aren't many action scene which is a great choice and in the few fight scenes which the movie has depicts how vulnerable is Arthur. The Nolan's Trilogy was a huge success and loved among the fans till date because it had a similar approach by making a batman film in a more realistic and a believable tone by making him more vulnerable to punches, guns, knives, dogs[;)] instead of making him more pumped up with too many gadgets, armor and fighting against the unbelievably strong godlike villains with his infinite stamina, health and never ending supply of his gadgets. The more grounded approach made the audience feel connected with Nolan's Trilogy. This film also follows in those footsteps and had achieved it perfectly. Todd Phillips with his direction and Joaquin Phoenix with his acting, together they have crafted a masterpiece."
Over the top!,"People are already familiar with superhero movie genres (like MCU) - state-of-the-art special effects, top-notch action, eye-catching action, clear good and evil, usually divided into two lines of good and bad characters fight with each other. Joker appears as a new breeze, the film with dark colors, heavy psychology, multiple meanings. The film also has a villain, but it seems that besides Joker, all the remaining characters are villains, he alone with his desire, with his soul and body have been trampled to the extreme against whole ""world"". The majority of moviegoers are young people, including those who once loved the Joker of The Dark Knight. The Joker in TDK is much more crazy from thinking to acting out through action. He lives for his IDEAL, making Harley Quinn crazy with him. Joaquin's Joker is also crazy but crazy in a more life-like manner, with more psychological changes, making the audience think more. And so among the heads who have seen Endgame, there are some who have not felt the Joker, have not been familiar with such a heavy psychological drama after days of watching and waiting for the super products blockbusters, romance movies, live - action movies and horror movies. And although I disagree with Martin Scorsese's opinion that ""Marvel movies are not movies"", I understand he has his reasons for saying so. Please review Joker a few more times to feel the full meaning of the movie, I myself could not understand all the messages that the film sent, so I will definitely have to watch it again. I am waiting for analyzing and explaining the cut scenes in Vietnam. But please don't say that Joker is ""bored"", ""sleepy"", ""not as good as Joker in TDK"", ... something like that. Because it's not natural that Joker is so appreciated. 😉"
A movie not made for all,"Ive been lucky to live and witness both Heath's and Joaquin's performance and till now the feeling is still surreal.It started with a slow pace, detail by detail describing how Joker became.

This one is not for people who like typical commercial movies and who don't like dark, intense and violent theme.
Robert de Niro's role was short but he did a great job as expected. The movie keeps getting dark. I loved the pace, direction & cinematography. And the BGM is just fantabulous. From the moment when he puts a smile on his face with blood shows that Arthur Fleck is dead now and The Clown Prince of Crime is born. From that moment, He is no longer just a shadow, he's the light of those people to stand up against the oppressors of Gotham. Truly, I feel so overwhelmed by watching this movie.

Blow Expectations Out of the Water.,"Review:
'Joker' is an American psychological-thriller film directed by Todd Phillips. Being one of my most anticipated movies of the year as well as a movie I never wanted to be made, I was feeling so many different emotions on my way to the theatre to see this film. I needed time to think about it and process what I had just seen because the movie is very dark and heavy, and after doing so I believe this is my favorite film to come out of 2019.
The movie follows the character of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is working as a clown-for-hire while living with and caring for his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City. We see Arthur get beaten down by society both literally and figuratively, from being jumped in an alley to being fired from his job and being called crazy and useless. Slowly over time, he starts thinking his life is a comedy and transforms into the clown he has been portraying for years.
If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal in this movie I will be both surprised and disappointed. What he did to prepare for this role was incredible and he brought everything to every scene he was in. Everybody in this movie fit their roles perfectly, but other than Joaquin Phoenix another standout performance for me has to be Robert De Niro. He wasn't in the film a whole lot, but I really believed he could have been a Talk-Show Host. He didn't phone it in at all and really committed which I appreciated.
I really can't talk about what I liked in this movie without going into spoiler territory. However, I will say that the movie needed to be Rated-R and I'm so happy Todd Phillips pushed the Studio into letting that happen. There were certain scenes that I could tell if they tried to do the same thing in a PG-13 film, it wouldn't have worked. They were also very smart in showing Arthur slowly progress into the Joker we know and it didn't just all happen at once, he hated his life in the beginning and dragged his feet when he walked, and by the end he is carrying himself with confidence.
Overall, I really can't say a lot about this movie beside I loved it! I beg for everybody to go and see this movie in theatres, movies like this deserve to make money so original films like this can be made. Yes, even though this is based off a 'Batman' character, it is still a very original story and I highly recommend.
5/5"
Unbelievably good.. so much better than I expected!,"I've just got back from the cinema and I'm still in complete shock how incredible this film is. The acting from Joaquin moved me in parts and felt uncomfortable but incredibly gripping at the same time, just amazing. I've never felt this way from any of the previous related films, but this one is very different. You truly feel empathy for Arthur even though he has none himself and this film not only helps to put the whole backstory into perspective in a way that's never been imagined before, but also truly unique and intense while retaining moments of dark humour even in some of the most depraved scenes. Absolute masterpiece!8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A chilling masterpiece,"Joaquin Phoenix is utterly phenomenal portraying the birth of Gotham's greatest villain, the Joker.
This is a story of man slowly losing faith in humanity to the point of madness. We get to know the Joker first as Arthur Fleck; a sad loner who isn't well liked because he makes people uncomfortable. He doesn't have friends, or a special someone in his life, only his mother who he still lives with and cares for. Arthur does the best that he can, working hard as a party clown but he is down on his luck and the world he lives in is brutal. On top of that his dream of becoming a comedian is shattered when talk show host Murray Franklin shows a clip of Arthur bombing at a comedy club. Meanwhile tension in Gotham has been mounting as the poor have been suffering and they turn their anger towards the rich, who seem completely indifferent to the struggles of those living in poverty. It's the perfect recipe for disaster and chaos.

Joker is vary good,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"""Joker"" is the pinnacle of comic book film","Now that the Joker has had a couple of legitimate outings, I think it's clear to say that Joker may be that best outing. I know that Heath Ledger is known to have the best performance, but wow does Phoenix deserve an Oscar. His character goes through such a terrifying and disturbing character arc that you don't want to see, yet can't look away. All the performances are sensational (including a couple of twists) and a brilliant ending to wrap everything together. The score matches it clearly, taking that ""Joker"" persona very clearly. I can't think of anybody that can match what this character may be. If Phoenix wins an Oscar, then this means that the Joker is one of the most complex and interesting character ever in film. All in all, Joker makes the viewer believe that everything he does is okay (but it's clearly not) and keeps you on the edge of your seat through brilliant direction and a sensational character study.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Best movie of the year so far,"Phoenix gives an absolutely phenomenal performance as the joker, in my opinion the best that has ever been put to screen.

The crying is how at the centre of it, Arthur actually has a good heart, but was screwed over by society, work and family.

First I thought, It would have been great if Martin Scorsese directed this film when it was announced long back, but #Todd_phillips proved he is a master in carving this Art-Emotional-Crime-SuperVillain-Drama , a little slow.. but not for me , So Deep, Dark & Psychological tale for the origin of The JOKER , Todd Phillips's previous Comedy-dramas have gave him so much experience & insight to deal this psychic comedian, and he used it perfectly.Cinematography, lighting, Set works, Editing have perfectly delivered us Retro style of Gotham city.Joaquin Phoenix is the best JOKER till date as same as Heath ledger. But if I must say who is the 1st best... it's ""Phoenix"" of course for me, hands down !! Because he showed us shades of sanity to Insanity . A full length character study throughout the duration of the film.Robert De Niro , what to say about him ? , Top notch performance as Murray.that vintage stage-dramatic music is so engaging & apt to every scene accordingly.-Over all it is one of the greatest comic based films .Phoenix deserves best actor academy award.#NOTE : This film is not like other DC/Marvel comics based films , not even a bit, far less popcorn entertainer than ""dark Knight trilogy""... No money heists, no major chase sequences, no blasts & shootouts , no big action sequences, ...It's something like the this decade's Taxi driver (1976), The King of comedy (1982) & Man on the moon (1999). If you are only into that above entertainer kinda stuff & doesn't like little slow art type films, then better stay away from this ."

"An instant classic, with the best performance since Ledger's Joker. Also, it has the most impactful last 15 minutes of any movie ever.","I was on board for this movie since day one. When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how you could see the the care and detail in every shot of the movie. And, Phoenix's performance looked insane. After the final trailer I was sure this movie was going to become best movie of 2019. And, when I finally coud watch, all my expectations were fulfilled. From start to end this movie just cannot stop. You will laugh, you will get shocked, you will even cry. This is the best character study I have seen since Taxi Driver. Simply, magnificent.

Joaquin Phoenix nailed the role and was captivating in his portrayal of mentally ill Arthur Fleck. Todd Philips is masterful in his directing of this film.

A Cinematic Masterpiece,"Todd Phillips created a solo Joker film and made it rated R. When I first saw the trailer, I actually hated it. I was expecting brutal violence and I wanted to see the Joker go full crazy. I changed my mind when I heard the reviews and I went to the theater the next day.I came out amazed. Joaquin Phoenix shatters this role effortlessly, and his performance was some of the best I have seen in years. Robert de Nero, a great actor too, does his part as Murray Franklin and is actually pretty likable. The score is haunting, mesmerizing, and kind of beautiful. This is the first movie that actually made me give a damn about the score in a film.This film needed to be made, and people out there need to see it. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and I'm not afraid to admit I have seen the movie twice in theaters, and even more at home. I truly enjoy this film and I truly recommend it."

"One of the best films of the last few decades, no less","Joker is one of the few movies of this time that I went to see in person, and boy was it worth it. No other crime film has given me such goosebumps that Joker has given me. And no other film ever will. I don't care what wannabe movie critics like Peter Bradshaw say about this film, because they're wrong and sold out.This movie tackles the degeneracy of our society in such a bold manner that it leaves people shocked. If I had to explain someone about dark humor with a movie, I'd suggest them this. And as a cherry on top, this was a very low budget film. Instead of the usual circus party CGI graphics we see from the cinematic universe of comic films, this movie uses traditional tricks like powerful color grading and what not.I vehemently stand against anyone who thinks this movie is anything short of a masterpiece.

Reminds me of good old days when junk food movies like Avengers and stuff like Transformers were not present. When movies like Fight Club, Seven, The Silence of The Lambs, Green Mile, Gladiator, Memento and many many more movies were being released.Joaquin deserved this Oscar with an outstanding performance. Period.
A true masterpiece in any sense.But Im sad they gonna make a sequel. Most likely will ruin everything.
A better idea would have been to let Todd Philips make a Two-Face or Penguin movie in the same manner."

A superb superhero movie not actually about superheroes,"This is the greatest Joker film I've seen. Like every other Joker, Joaquin Phoeinx added a unique touch to this great and controversial character. He is not overacting, he is not too crazy. He is consistent throughout the movie and a joy to watch. His laugh is absolutely brilliant, no wonder he had to practice it so much. Totally worth it, great job.But enough of Joaquin's praises. Time to move on to the story itself. I came into this movie totally unprepared, ready to watch another Joker film. This wasn't another Joker film, this was the Joker film. So many things can be said about what was presented to us, especially Joker's origins. I'm not going to spoil it, it's just not worth it. You must go and watch this piece of treasure.Also, forgot to mention, that this movie doesn't just tell the Joker's story but criticizes our current society and its deep rooted issues. If you are attentive enough, you'll realise that and you'll sit down and really think things through. Believe me."

The Best JOKER,"The best DC in history. The best Joker in history. It's the most original comic joker. The joker portrayed by Phoenix performs extremely well, whether they can't restrain the pain under the laughter, the inner struggle behind the wry smile, or they want to laugh, but they have to pretend they can't laugh. All of them are telling the story of this terrible life step by steps. At the beginning of the film, the story of the ancient times is slowly pushed forward, and a series of attacks are completely out of control and outbreak after knowing the truth of his mother. This is the real track that happens to every bottom people in the society. Almost all of them choose compromise and tolerance. So there is only one Joker in the world. At last, the dialogue in the studio shows the life of the Joker's heart. So I believe remember the core values of socialism, and live in harmony in a civilized society is important.3 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

He is so good it made me wonder if he's a bit crazy in real life. Unfortunately there is a bit of the ""elites are a bit too narcissistic"" to make the real elites in Hollywood comfortable enough to allow this movie the awards it should generate. The story moves along with no dull moments to make you want to get some popcorn.

"Brilliant, Perfect, Powerful, Real","Only those who experience/d abuse, disrespect, disregard, injustice, violence, misfortune, negligence, humiliation and rejection from a very young age, will understand the feel, the need, the desire for justice, fairness, revenge, vengeance from all humans (family and society) ""in loco"", if possible. ""Joker"" is not a so fictional character. Unfortunately, there are plenty of joker's out there who were mistreated, neglected, and abused, by factual inferior human beings, that have gone free without there well-deserved punishment. This union of talent and capacity forces of Todd Philips and Joaquim Phoenix just had realism into the story. Plus, from a neurologic point of view, it showed us how a sociopath is made. Particularly, how the pain and suffer that leads to depression and pos-traumatic stress disorder, can change the brain chemical balance, the reality perspective, and, ultimately, the personality; transforming us into a confident, fearless, courageous, and vengeful human creature, but still with a sense of justice. It's also a positive point of this movie conception, that the introduction of the ""Batman"" story was very well determined and written. Let's cheer up to this corrupt and violent society that we live in! At least, they made something right this year: to give the Oscar to the most brilliant actor of all - Joaquim Phoenix.

"Chilling, Nerve wrecking, Depressing yet A pure Masterpiece","This movie showcases joker not as a character but an ideology which is common in our society. How a depressed person is trying to adjust in normal society yet he found discomfort from the people ignorance for mental disorders which leads to creation of one of the best character in cinematic history ""JOKER"". This movie clearly depicts how a mental illness can take shape and take a disastrous turn against the same society which shaped the person in its current form.

"About Joker, Batman and us","When Batman made his debut the year was 1939. In Europe, the nazism was offering a solution to poverty: the chosen and pure ones have to take the lead to organize a better life. This fascist thing was also in the air after the communism had shown its contradictions and violence. With the victory in the II World War liberal democratic countries had to propose a new version of capitalism. This human version, the Welfare State, went through more or less till the 70's when the neoliberalism arrived in the political scene advocating cuts in social expenditures and state shrinking. In a way, Batman and Joker were created from the same ground of despair and hope in the mid of the last century. We are now in 2019. The welfare state capitalism is in the hospital badly wounded. The evil may be explained by a real troubled life of the Joker maybe not. As Joker realizes his potency after every crime perpetrated by him, the young batman must accomplish a double task in the future: to turn Gothan city a livable place for all and to dismantle the joker's way of the necessary use of violence by the dispossessed. If Batman fails in this noble tale, the fascism will come again to organize the jokers promising a better life. Great Film!"

"A movie that borders on genius-repellant, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable.","Phoenix deserves all the glory that he is receiving for this role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside his usual comedy films. Joker is insane and utterly unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, it has paid off. A darker DCEU was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of idea's. Joker is interesting and thought provoking, something the MCU can only dream about. The Black Panther is not the Joker by any means, so expect to see this sitting at the Oscars. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratch Catcher be introduced in the future films?

Finally Frank Miller should be happy - and proud!,"Never thought Phoenix could beat Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, but Phoenix did the impossible - and there's no doubt - this movie is a 10/10.
After watching the film I was thinking that now I had just watched my very first superhero (ok, supervillain then) movie. Frank Miller would be proud - I hope, because this is the first movie from DC where I felt the atmosphere and story matched or transcended the best books. Ledger might still have delivered the best comic book Joker performance, but Phoenix just went beyond the books and made the Joker come out the books and made him into a real person. Like for the first time turning Pinocchio into a real boy ;-)I do think there might be an age problem though, unless we're going to see Batman beating up the elderly in later movies, but maybe some clever writer can fix that, lol.Note that Joker isn't for kids including young teenagers, not really because of violence, but this is a movie for adults. It's not funny nor is it an action movie, mostly I think - like Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns books - this is a film about society - a political film about wealth inequality and the consequences. A movie cleverly disguising and reflecting our current world. To quote the movie Seven:""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.""and the Joker hits you with a sledgehammer like never before. You could say it's also a movie about the nature of being evil. - In psychology the term does not really exist, because being evil can be reduced to many different components, so is the Joker really evil - or sick - or a product of society - or everything combined (=sum of traumatic incidents and triggers)? That - together with Phoenix' godlike performance - make this movie a 10/10.BTW, saw the 4K disc version on a 85"" high-end Sony TV. The 4K version is reference when it comes to 4K image quality, maybe topped only by Mortal Engines. Blacks are really blacks due to HDR and the resolution is so high it feels like swinging a microscope over Phoenix face from time to time. I could even clearly see the dirt under his bitten fingernails - which was kinda gross. Also his dirty teeth, and every skin imperfection, all his hair etc. This movie was so disturbingly clear I was thinking that maybe the more blurry blu-ray version would be better, lol - but the clarity did add presence like (close to) never before. Felt like watching a stream of photographs. There's a small amount of film grain used, but you don't notice it in most scenes.Sound and music were awesome too, and the 4K disc contains Dolby Atmos sound as usual - in fact the music may be another reason for buying the 4K disc version - Joker got a second Oscar for the music."
WhySoSerious!!!,"There is an African proverb that says ""The child who is not embraced by the village will someday burn the whole village down to feel its warmth"".
This gem from the DC world has shown it how.
""Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.""
This eternal struggle has taken the form of Joaquin's Joker, unearthing the hidden wounds of the society.
He had comically noted down ""I just hope my death make more cents (sense) than my life""
Joker itself is a living statement on this apathetic society and paves way for need of the Batman..

"""Isn't It Rich?!""...","JOKER is astounding and confrontational. It covers issues like mental illness, class warfare, guns, societal breakdown, etc., while presenting a ""villain"" in Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is as sympathetic as he is terrifying. Filled w/ uncomfortable, even shocking moments, as well as unsettling comedic elements, some scenes will make many viewers squirm! Arthur is the overlooked, dismissed ""nobody"", forced to believe he doesn't even exist. He's a man in desperate need of help. Unfortunately, Gotham city isn't the place to find it. As his mind begins to shatter, Arthur has no idea what's coming his way. He simply finds his strength in a sudden act of violence, and somehow taps into the void within those around him, ultimately becoming a sort of messiah. The mesmerizing Mr. Phoenix uses his body as much as his dialogue to bring both Arthur and his alter ego to life. This is a movie to be watched and taken seriously, in spite of its comic book origins. It's as much a serious statement as it is entertainment. Multiple viewings recommended...4 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"""...you wouldn't get it.""","It has been quite awhile since I have seen a movie in cinemas that is absolutely horrifying, thought-provoking, and could be considered an overall great film. JOKER kicks the door down and takes all of these accolades, as well as multiple Oscars hostage, with no Batman, or films of this caliber in sight to stop it.
Enter the gritty, decrepit, and timeless city of Gotham, where the rich keep getting richer, the poor keep getting poorer, and violence is at an all-time high.
""Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"" asks Arthur Fleck, our central character played by Joaquin Phoenix. He lives in a small apartment with his aging mother, who reassures him that he was meant to ""bring joy and laughter to the world"" as he pursues a career in stand-up comedy.
You will not be waiting long to see this man's downward spiral begin, as his poor living conditions and mental illnesses are on full display, to devastating effect for the audience. Couple that with rampant crime, corrupt politicians, and the overall hatefulness of Gotham, and we begin to see the twisted, pained grin of the greatest comic-book villain of all time form on this seemingly kind-hearted man's face.
""They don't give a $#&% about people like you Arthur"", his psychiatrist tells him as she reveals that due to budget cuts, he will no longer receive his medication he so desperately needs. Scenes like this provide a constant tension, as the audience have some idea going in as to what we can expect from the title alone.
You will be right alongside him for the ride as his life and mental health deteriorate to the point that neither he, nor we, can decipher who to trust, what's real anymore, or if we even exist at all. Are his recollections accurate? What is wrong and what is right? Where is the line between justice and vengeance? It is these questions that are the strengths of JOKER, and where it truly shines.
By the time the credits roll, you will be left with these questions, but also answers that are beautifully weaved into the classic storyline by director Todd Phillips. Most important though, you will have a comic-book movie that steps outside the norm to remind you that sometimes the most diabolical villains are created, maybe by you...
The final punchline of JOKER is a solid 10/10.
""Goodnight, and always remember... that's life!"""
A must watch for everyone,"Ok I know I am late on this one....I waited till Joker came out on digital because I wanted to watch it without distractions. In reference to the job I do, I know the impact of mental illness plays in today's society. It is disheartening to see that people with serious and true mental health issues are shuffled in a system that over burdened and under funded. This does not include addicts and malingeres.I greatly appreciate this movie because it shows the spiraling decent of a man that needed serious attention. It shows the impact that abuse and domestic violence causes on the mind. This movie was panned by critics that couldn't wrap their simple minds that these issues in the mental health system, leave those who truly need help lost and tied to red tape.People need see past the comic book lore we have grown to know and see that this movie is a story on today's society and the violence that one untreated can cause.Look past whether or not Jaquine Pheonix deserves an oscar (which he truly does besides the point) and see that we need to take better care of those in our country that need help. We need hold the value of every life in highest regard and hold the oppressive bureaucracy accountable.This movie not just a work of art, it is a dissertation of the world today. Watch it and learn from it. It needs to be known that one man can cause chaos that affects the world. Every actor that has played the Joker has put there own spin on it. Romero was the maniac, Nicholson was the Narcissist, Ledger was the fanatic, and Pheonix is the reflection. He portrayed the most real and poignant Joker today. Hollywood take notes, people need a dose of reality sometimes and this movie delivered it."
Absolutely Brilliant example of the mind,"Joker is a powerful social critique of our perception towards mental health (how would we react if someone started laughing uncontrollably in the street?), but it can also be seen as an absurdist perspective on free will. Arthur's fatal flaw is not the hubris of Odysseus, or the ambition like Macbeth, but the simple and relatable need to discover why he was born, and for others to notice his existence. He achieves both of these things in the film, but the symbolic death of ""Arthur"" with the killing of his mother and rebirth of the comedic ""Joker"", occurs from a catalytic reaction with society, rather than as an agent of his own destiny.In philosophy, ""the Absurd"" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe. In the film, this conflict reaches its culmination when Arthur embraces his involuntary laughter as his real self, and finally understands the ""joke"". Life itself. It's a joke for absurdists. As he says in the film, comedy is subjective.When he accepts who he is, he is finally seen by others, and becomes a symbol of chaos and anarchy in a grotesque parody of the superhero. But crucially, this is not something he chooses to become, it's something he is forced into becoming because of his genetics, his environment, and his mother. Arthur ultimately sees life as a comedy - as absurd - because he loses belief in free will. And that actually makes him a classic tragic figure. Arthur wanted to bring laughter and happiness into the world, but was always going to be the killer called the Joker."

Simply Perfect,"I never write a review of the movie until today. This is the perfect roll for Joaquin
Phoenix, and i think it's because he didn't have to act too much. I must say that this movie made me look for all his rolls and is his one of the kind actor that he is highly underrated. This performance doesn't deserve number in grades, it desreve respect .But the real winner of this story is Todd Phillips, ( I bet he knoe what Joaquin can pool off, and he sow it right from the beginning), because it was a complicated story that only Joaquin could pull off; I really don't see another actor can make this role. And we can all wonder how many Joker DNA we have inside of ourselves, how much we become slaves to this system that can cannot import slaves anymore but they are sure that we are all be productive like they was before.4 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Triggering Masterpiece,"Everyone will appreciate this film, but only a select few will relate to it entirely. As someone who has deeply suffered with social isolation and severe depression, this is the only film in existence that had me crying my eyes out to the point of a near panic attack. My emotions were so high throughout the whole movie I could hardly pay attention to what was going on. Anyone who has ever felt emptiness so deep that you feel completely hollow, wanting to just give up entirely, wondering how it's so easy for everyone else, please be warned. You should not view this movie if you have any recent depressive episodes. This film brought me back to being a teenager, so angry with the society that rejected me, frustrated with those that would never understand themselves as being an involuntary contributor. As I was watching Joaquin Phoneix hit the threshold few of us have approached, watching his psyche crack and his spirit break, the audience around me was laughing at his superficially ""silly"" behavior. This admittedly made my blood boil to the point that I half wanted to lash out at their clear ambivalent ignorance, similarly to the path of the Joker. I'm partially worried for less stable people's potential reaction to this stunning performance. However hope this will help the general public who have not suffered with mental health, better understand what causes people to ""abruptly"" become ""crazy"". I spent an hour crying in my car afterwards, remembering how it felt to give up and just isolate myself instead, crawling into a dark hole. I can honestly say I have never related to a performance to this extent. The character development was nothing short of a masterpiece."
A truthful look at one mans disturbing journey,"I do not like super hero movies. Fortunately, this is not one. This is an incredibly disturbing character study of a man who happens to appear in comic books and other movies. This man is different than all of those other men. This man has nothing to do with those other men. It is not necessary to compare Arthur Fleck to the Joker of the Dark Knight. This is not about that joker. Arthur Fleck does not become that Joker.This is the story of a mentally ill man who becomes an accidental icon. It is not a negative statement against mental illness. It is a look at one mentally ill man. It is not in any way saying that all mentally ill people become homocidal maniacs. Arthur Fleck just happens to become one.Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent interpretation of a very creative script. He is not trying to play ""the Joker"". He is trying to tell the truth of one mans life, and he succeeds. It is very disturbing to watch. It's more disturbing to sit with the thoughts you will have about yourself and about society while Arthur's story unfolds. I was also disturbed by the audience around me, and also by myself, laughing at dark moments in this mans life. This movie holds a mirror to society and it's hard to ignore the image you see reflected before your eyes. Go see it, it's worth it."

Give this man an Oscar!,"Mesmerizing performance by the legendary Joaquin Phoenix is only one piece of a puzzle that makes this movie a must to watch. You simply cannot move your eyes away from him throughout the entire film and that's about 99.9 percent of the time he is on screen. Yes, he carries it on his own and everyone else is just a side character.
The screenplay and the brilliant direction Todd Phillips decides to take the film surpasses all the expectations of the viewer. When watching it, it's very difficult to predict what will happen in the next scene and that's what makes this film stand out from the bunch.
I don't remember the last time, I was asking that many questions after leaving the theater.

Simply Brilliant,"After the longest time DC comes back with a bang to remind the world where the real story begins. Joker is simply a showcase of true brilliance of Todd Phillips and Joaquin illustrating the roots of a madman. The concept of one bad day which could happen to anyone has been so well portrayed that it's truly a treat for anyone who sits through the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Regardless of the timelines Joaquin has outdone himself to bring life to a character which many felt was irreplaceable after the performance of the great Heath Ledger.Joaquin's joker is a reminder to all Batman fans who have watched through the decades, of Mark Richard Hamill and the insane joker that he has given us back in the 90's. In comparison to the joker which we see in this movie is a crazy psychopath in the making as compared to the schizophrenic joker that Heath Ledger plays in the Dark Knight.Both jokers have done justice to the character and probably the most dreaded villian of the Batman. The transition of the joker is worth every single second of this movie, and I could bet that you wouldn't want the movie to end when it ends."
Masterpiece. Best Joker adaptation.,This movie is a study on mental illness. It brings awareness about problems in society. Not giving anything else away. You'd have to see it to believe it.

After 30 minutes I was so uncomfortable but at the same time so curious to see what it is going to happen .When I say is disturbing is because it is real, It is not the same Batman films with explosions and unreal mystic powers magic or anything like that. After watching this film you will be more careful about people any people, because mental illness is real and you never know when you will find a psychopath , he or she can be sit next to you.

"Quite simply, perfection.","""A gritty character study of Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society"" is IMDB's excellent byline description of this deep exploration of disintegrating (disintegrated?) mental health.It's described as taking place in the 'Scorseseverse' by some critics, in that Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck appears to be an homage to many of Scorsese's monumental 70's characters. And what's more, De Niro has a supporting role that shows he still can deliver the goods when not just taking a part for the money.So I've already used the M word and in this Academy Award winning performance (of that there is no doubt) Joaquim Phoenix's monumental performance will put the Academy back on track after their laughable decision to recognise Rami Malek for impersonating Freddie Mercury last year.I detest impersonation movies on the whole, but this is no impersonation, this is a character crafted out of magic. It's not a superhero movie in the slightest and all the better for it. It's simply a character study of great depth and extreme nuance.One thing I loved about this intense study of a disintegrating man is the extreme close ups that shows Phoenix in all his imperfections, his upper lip, his wonky teeth, his chewed finger nails, his nicotine stained fingers (possibly make-up). It's glorious.It is unquestionably a masterpiece, not just for Phoenix's performance, but for every SINGLE aspect of cinema: music (White Room by Cream blasts out of the screen in the final apocalyptic act to tremendous effect - but it's outstanding throughout), make-up (stunning), costume (stunning), cinematography (stunning - the dance on the steps and the aerial train track shot particularly blew me away), design (epic) and direction (Todd Phillips follows up his epic production, but not direction, of A Star Is Born remarkably It's interesting looking at Todd Phillips' Filmography though - a real mixed bag with much of it centred on comedy - The Hangover in particular.)But you don't need me to tell you how good this movie is - you don't get a 9.1 rating on IMDB without reason.See it and bathe in its mastery."
Joker is a masterpiece,Joker is a brilliant piece of film making and an instant classic it will be spoke about for years to come and is officially my favourite film and will be watching it more and more as the years go by and carry on getting mesmerised by the great performances score and choreography in this gritty character study 10/104 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

This is the only time I watched a movie more than once in theaters,"I was very nervous when I went to see this film. The joker character is one of my favorite ch of all time, and I was worried showing the characters origin story would take away the mystery and make him less interesting. This film however put so much thought and effort into his background that I left the theater completely in love.
Joaquin phoenix did a perfect job playing as Arthur, and he absolutely deserves that Oscar. He is without a doubt the best part of the film. I cried, cheered, was worried and in suspense fall throughout the film because of him.
Everytime I watch the film I discover something new that adds more to the story. There is so much detail shown throughout the film that it really makes me appreciate how much effort Todd Phillips put into this film. There are so many different ways to interpret the film that it constantly has me evaluating it trying to come up with different theories as of what's going on.
There are a few flaws I noticed, or at least small things that bothers me. But the good heavily outweighs the bad, and the flaws I've noticed don't take away from the story or the drama.

"A incredible, heartbreaking story","The Joker turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Joaquin is so believable, so real, so present that I honestly felt uncomfortable: like watching the movie was like intruding on someones private life. This felt a lot more like a documentary than anything else. so raw. so devastating and sad. I felt his pain and outrage pour out through the screen: it was easy to empathise with him and his suffering. If Joaquin does not get an oscar for this I will be outraged.7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
You'll never root for Batman again,"A film about the Joker. What a great idea! Jared Leno must be delighted to be front and centre as arguably one of the most famous and recognisable bad-guys ever in popular culture. Unfortunately, DC's 'shared universe' ran into one or ten problems and has become fractured into... well, no one really knows what. Only that Jared Leno's 'Joker' appears to have been dumped after his woefully small appearance in 'Suicide Squad' and now Joaquin Phoenix puts on the clown make-up for the role.How 'Joker' fits in with what has been and what is left of DC's original attempt at bringing 'Justice League' together is anyone's guess. If you liked (or hated!) all those previous installments it doesn't really matter. Don't go into this film looking to see how it ties in. There might be a sequel, there might now. It doesn't matter. This film is so good that I almost hope it stays as a 'stand alone' film, just in case the quality deteriorates.Phoenix plays 'Arthur Fleck' (yup, no more 'Jack Napier' here!), a down-on-his-luck resident of Gotham City who struggles with his mental health issues while just about scraping a living working as a clown and looking after his sickly mother. It's rare that a film - even one that's mainly about a single individual - actually has that character in every scene. With 'Joker' there's rarely a minute where Phoenix isn't on screen... and therefore stealing the scene. Robert DeNiro is also on the cast list and - yes - obviously he's excellent (but he's not in it that much, so don't expect too much screen time for him). It's also interesting that many people also see the similarities of two of DeNiro's other work. If you've seen (and, if not, I recommend you watch) 'Taxi Driver' or 'King of Comedy' then you'll see more than a few nods here and there.I know that many recent Batman fans will say that there's no other Joker than Heath Ledger and us oldies will always say that Jack Nicholson did it best. I certainly won't argue with anyone who admires either of their performances, but Phoenix shows that, even stepping into their big clown shoes, he can still bring something new to the role.Yes, it's - technically - a superhero film, but it never really feels like one. There are no lavish computer-generated special effects of heroes/villains with superpowers. There are plenty of points which obviously link in to the whole 'Batman mythos,' but you could almost watch this film as more of a study of mental illness than an 'origin story' for the Joker.It may not be for everyone. Yes, it is brutal and there are some shockingly-real acts of graphic violence here and there. There's been a lot of speculation in the media about 'Joker's' hidden meaning and the impact creating a film about a villain and promoting them as a 'hero.' Personally, I don't think that anyone (sane) would ever commit any sore of crime because of a movie, even this one. One reviewer said it best when he said that there wasn't a massive spike in violent crime after the cinematic release of 'American Psycho' so why would there be one now with 'Joker?' The character 'Joker' - despite being the focus of the story - is never really shown as some sort of 'role model' for us all to follow. We may understand - some of - his motives, but anyone in their right mind would never truly wish to emulate him.I don't want to give away anything away about the plot as this is a film you really do need to watch yourself. I'm not one to say who should be in line for an Oscar. I don't know whether Phoenix will win one (probably not), but his performance is definitely worthy of praise."
A MASTERPIECE,"People were expecting this movie and this joker to be just like The Dark Knight, but how can it be when they're showing his journey from the beginning, and realistically speaking, how can a normal man with no history of violence can do what the Joker from dark knight did? I'm in love with the new storyline, and how society and some mental illnesses made him what he is, the whole movie makes so much sense. if the Joker is a real person in this world that would be the how he turned into Joker, that what makes it a 10/10, + the effects, the cinematography and how dark the violence is, and in my opinion without overhyping it, i consider it the movie of the decade.7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Necessary industry wake-up call,"Hopefully a remedy to an increasingly soulless industry, although it's attempt to personify our societal issues will be sure to leave you feeling hapless and empty. What critics don't seem to accept is the value in a movie not leaving you skipping out of the theatre, it seems addressing modern issues head-on has become far too 'problematic' for our film commissars these days. If you'd rather bury your head in the sand, Disney is always waiting with another reincarnation of whatever the money people conjure up next.7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

In a world of horrible re-makes/sequels......,Joker is an original movie that may be slow for some people who cant sit patiently as you are rewarded with dramatic tension. I really do time my rest room breaks appropriately but it had me so focused I held it and ran out of my refreshments not to miss a detail. Yes I'll see it again and yes I'll buy it when it comes out. This is creatively told and shown in a rather clever way and allows you to forget that this man used to be Johnny Cash. Amazing performance!!!7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
I wasn't expecting much from this movie and fell in love with it!,"First of all, the message in this film is great especially with what's going on in the world. Everybody who goes to see this movie will probably walk away thinking the exact same thing and know what the message is. At this point I think it's pretty obvious what everybody already knows and I'm just going to put in my five cents and that's Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/Joker and he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. He went all-in with this character showing the different stages in his life and making everybody feel bad for him. At certain points in the film, I felt really bad for the guy and wanted to help him out because nobody deserves to be treated that way. It also helps that he didn't start out as wanting to become the Joker but society just helped turn him into him. Robert De Niro, who plays Murray Franklin, probably won't get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor but he still did a standout job with his character. Another thing that stood out to me was the cinematography of the movie and how it helped show Arthur's slow descent into madness and how he views the world. I feel like some people are waiting for me to hate on the pacing of this film and honestly, I had no problem with it at all. If the movie was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on and any shorter and they would have rushed the Joker transformation. But with that in mind, this film is like most people have said already and that's a character story. So, if you don't want to watch a story about a man who's driven to his breaking point and wants to see an action superhero then stay home and watch The Dark Knight. I love how the costume was different from any Joker suit we've seen before, though it's hard to replicate without buying a store-bought costume. The music by Hildur Guonadottir was amazing. In the end, this movie is an amazing character story with an important message. I give Joker a 10/10."

Beyond Expectations,"This film is something else, being a DC fan all my life, I'm certainly glad to see a different take on The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is potentially one of the best Jokers now. His laugh is spot on and certainly goes beyond many others. Joaquin's overall performance is powerful and one of best in recent years. Todd Phillip's vision for a gritty non-comic based Joker film really sheds light on the problems Gotham's society. Which can easily portray a number of the problems in our actual society. Things such as lack of funding for mental health, rude and terrible people who only want to bring others down, and simply crime. Many people are scaring audiences about and there's no need to be afraid, this movie is potentially the most realistic take on a comic book Super Villain yet.7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A Masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix could be the next Oscar winner,"Dear movie freaks, Joker is the most anticipated movie that we have been expecting since the first month of year 2019 and yes this is a very good dramatic movie. I said dramatic because Joker delivers us the ideas on how Arthur Fleck character can be Joker, right when we totally forgot about Batman appearance. We don't care about Batman here. We care about a joker, a comedian, a broken child, and a really sad story of a man who sacrifices everything to be happy, yet we never really understand what is going on his mind and heart, until we saw the killings and the blood and we blame him as a villain. I really salute the Director, the make up team, editor, cinematographer, scriptwriter, and Joacquin Phoenix acting, wow he could win Oscar for this movie. This movie has few actions, but a lot of tears and drama and how we can reflect to ourselves, are we really happy or just a made-up-happy just to make our life comfortable....2 hours are not enough to understand Joker but I really love the ending that you can't watch without clapping your hands.

The Perfect Origin Story Capturing The Clown Prince Of Crime's Descent Into Madness,"The joker is easily the greatest super villains of all time, so a movie focusing solely on this character was either a hit or miss, but a miss it is definitely not.Joker is one of those films which leaves an impactful mark on the viewers.Making full use of the available source material, the film, at the same time feels original and adds a certain amount of depth to it which is brought forward by classic and unpredictable storytelling.Phoenix's portrayal of the uprising crown prince of crime was exceptional in its own right, and is Oscar-worthy without any doubt. In addition, the direction, the writing, the cinematography, the music, the supporting performances were all very impressive.Verdict : Living up to the hype, this super villain origin story digs deep into the joker's descent into madness, perfectly showcased by a strong leading performance and powerful writing and directing."

"Finally, a movie that top The Dark Knight","This is the only movie that I felt giving 10/10 is justice. This movie is so original in every inch and have pushed the boundary of cinema much further. It's perfectly written, be it the script, the music score, the screenplay, the pacing, everything is very masterful. And by the end you'll be really convinced as how the Joker came to be how we know he is. This movie made the story of Batman that we know and love made so much more sense that you'll finally feel complete. I'm looking forward for the Batman movie. With Rob Pattinson cast as Batman, I'm optimistic it's a perfect role for him as how Jacquin Phoenix is the perfect one to play the Joker. Before, you'd think The Dark Knight is a dark story, and Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is the perfect actor to play the Joker. You'll change your mind. Hats off to you Jacquin. Don't matter what the critique or interviewer say. You and everyone involved in creating this movie has shaked the cinematic world. This movie made the whole Marvel expanded cinematic universe look like they were made by amateurs. So step aside Marvel.

One movie.,With enough substance to rival an entire cinematic universe!This perfect balance of real world grit and comic book lore might make you stay back to watch the end credits just to appreciate the team that put this gem together.And that's because this is not a franchise. This is cinema.There is no merchandising greed on display. Just love for characters that have been part of our lives for most of our lives.Joker restores the much needed respect to the pure art of storytelling that lies within the pages of many a comic book.Something that was being covered under layer after layer of sfx and pandering in almost every release since the dark knight.Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix take it away.And take it away in style.
Much needed masterpiece,"Wow ! I'll be honest that I did not expect this one to live up to the hype, but it did. We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you. This is one of the greatest films that has come out in this decade. Congrats to the whole team who made it possible, outstanding job !"
The film we've been waiting for,"Yes, the film has some dangerous elements to it given the current climate of human sanity in general. But this film is a perfect origin story for a villain.

I honestly think Heath would be super proud!I'm not going to get into any details, because you should most definitely experience this movie first hand...the acting, cinematography, production, writing/dialogue and story are all TOP NOTCH and it is most definitely Oscar worthy....In fact, i have a feeling this movie is going to sweep the Oscar's...it is THAT good!I suggest seeing it while it is still playing in theaters, because the movie-going experience of seeing this on the big screen is second to none!"

Leaves you speechless!,"Joker is an original movie about the iconic Batman villain of the same name, exploring his origins. It tells the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), a man who feels rejected by society.Joker is a mind-blowing film. Director Todd Phillips has given us a one of a kind comic book movie, that delves deep into the psyche of its titular character. What we get is a riveting film with twists & turns, that will leave you guessing, right till the end. Joaquin Phoenix is the star of the show, as Arthur Fleck. Phoenix completely immerses himself in the role & gives us another unforgettable performance. He deserves all the praise, accolades & Oscar buzz coming his way. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker, matches up to Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker, in The Dark Knight(2008). He also gives us a perfectly chilling 'Joker laugh'. Robert De Niro is awesome as Murray Franklin. Zazie Beetz is spectacular as Sophie Dumond. Frances Conroy is outstanding as Penny Fleck. Brett Cullen is amazing as Thomas Wayne. Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler & Leigh Gill are superb as Detective Burke, Detective Garrity, Randall & Gary, respectively. The supporting cast is excellent. Joker is a must watch for all the fans of one of the best comic book villains of all time. Go for it, as soon as possible!"
Speechless ....,"The film is different from anything I've seen before. Normally the villain is part of a hero story - but here everything revolves around the icon of all movie villains. Without giving anything away, this is a must-see movie.

Awesome,"So this was well promoted on every social net you could think. So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5

Not For Everyone.,"Well, I see a lot of people complaining about this movie that it isn't reasonable because they don't understand the movie. It isn't necessary that you don't find a movie logical so it's a bad movie. Really I feel sorry for those people or simply haters. People fears or hates what they don't realize and as for the movie this is just one of those types. This is not your typical movie which will make you laugh, will entertain you in every way possible and in the end will give you a happy ending so that you can make it out of the theater and tell everyone ''it's a great movie'', no it is not that way at all. 'Joker' is something with greater meaning which will make you pointing your own finger at yourself. It is a character study that will make you standing on your feet and applauding if you got the message. I think this is where i might cut it short, here is a simple suggestion, go to the hall and watch the movie. Not to forget about 'Joaquin Phoenix' you just did a hell of acting right there.

Powerful film on social commentary using a comic book villian,"I can understand why some people would not like it. The pace was slow. There were moments that would make the audience saying ""What?"", kinds of like playing games. However, the movie on the whole was a powerful one. We were basically in his head most of the movie. We saw what he sees, and this guy was a walking time bomb. He had many sign of trouble, lack of confidence, self insecure, and loneliness. Because the problem was not treated, he went spiraled down. He could be a metaphor for many brewing problems, like he could be Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square massacre when the city got traumatized for those who know the history of the city. Despite the slow pace, I thought it fitted perfectly his inner struggle and his mental breakdown. The setting was outstanding, and needless to say the performance.

"Uncanny performance of Phoenix, top notch cinematography, epic music score, wonderful supporting cast","Perhaps bias, perhaps not, but what a movie. I haven't seen many movies from Joaquin Phoenix apart from Gladiator, so not knowledgeable about his abilities as an actor. But I am pretty sure after seeing this performance that he ranks amongst the best at this time.I was a huge fan of Heath Ledger in the last great Joker appearance (lets forget the Suicide Squad) in Dark Knight, but I'm considering this to be even better. Better because Joaquin and director Philips, never attempted to emulate that Joker, but installed a completely new version of him. A man driven to madness. The expression on Joaquin's face is so intensive and plain scary.The cinematography, the fitting music, the original Joker theme, gotta gotta give Todd the kudos, Oscar worthy at least. As I understand it, he was as amazed at Joaquin's performance as most of the movie loving audience.The last 30 minutes of the film were exceptional. Multiple violent scenes, leading up to his appearance on De Niro's tv show (great acting here as well on De Niro's part), the shocking finale, the rise of the Joker as anti hero and the last scene which will be debated until the next instalment of the Joker (2).Dear movie lovers, if you can handle violence, if you can appreciate great acting and love musical scores, see this movie on the big screen while you still can. you won't regret it."
Joker,"Unquestionably the most sensational autobiography on a villain I've seen to date. Joker is masterful in almost every aspect, but most importantly, able to truly focus on the inner workings of perhaps the most well-known in the superhero realm. The best part of the film is that it is not dumbed down to suit the fanboys, it is done in a mature and art-house way to influence and inspire the audience. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar level performance that is one for the ages. Also love the uncertainty of every scene, the constant questioning of what is real and what is not. The eccentricity of the character does not feel forced, it conjures a sort of sympathy from the audience throughout the film. Every scene, every movement and every dialogue felt sinister in a poetic way.Not sure if the DC Universe can follow suit after this, but I think they should leave this as an independent work. Felt the last scene with Thomas Wayne is somewhat unnecessary and broke the mood a little.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The darkest yet most important pieces of cinema in recent years,"Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is unquestionably one of the darkest yet incredibly powerful and important pieces of cinema in recent years. Reactions have ranged from wholly irresponsible, to mean spirited. However, one which is not particularly explored is its seeming importance in an age of which Gotham's societal issues seem much like any other western city. To say that Joker is a microcosm of today's society would not be much of a stretch - in fact it would be pretty accurate.Gotham is in-turmoil, as a consequence of strikes its streets are littered with rubbish, the rich are getting richer, budgets are getting cut and seemingly the powers to be have no interest or do not deem mental health to be of importance; sound familiar? Within this toxic, cruel and bitter city Arthur Fleck (Joker, Joaquin Phoenix) a troubled and struggling comic suffering from severe mental disorders has to go about his daily life and make sense of his own reality. After finding out his mental health treatments will be cut and the state will no longer provide funds for his medication he is left to fend for himself.To say that the comic to movie trick has run its creative course would be an understatement. In-fact, to say that Marvel and DC have squeezed every last penny out of each generic, painstaking superhero franchise would be a lie - because there is undoubtedly another one coming out next week (even if you are reading this in 2035). Having said that what director Todd Phillips alongside writer Scott Silver have managed to accomplish is to reinvent (yet again) what a comic book character can embody and stand for. Director of the Hangover movies and Due Date (although good comedic movies in their own right) Phillips' rebirth is perhaps the biggest surprise to 2019. Each and every element of Joker is perfectly on point, and Phillips' envision of what a Joker movie should entail is clearly brought to life. Phillips' depiction of the Joker's world is awesomely dark and that darkness transpires through its spectral score, glum environment and intense visual acting.Joaquin's Joker is truly his own, in which the brilliant script and plot gives him the freedom to do so. His desperate, insidious undertones are apparent throughout, of which occasionally becomes satisfyingly uncomfortable. From his uncontrollable laughing fits to his existential dance routines this is one obscenely creepy guy. Compassion or sympathy are not words that spring to mind when describing the Joker; rather pity. Pity for his intolerably unfortunate set of circumstances in that he is left to his own devices to tackle his awful existence without the support or help from anyone.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is eerily beautiful in all the ways it should be, bordering on uncomfortable at times this film rides the cusp perfectly. Always leaving you second guessing, each scene feels as though it is improvised (in a good way) and it is truly impossible to predict which way each set piece will go. Each scene contributes seamlessly to the overall narrative that Phillips is trying to convey, it's with-strained and outright outlandish when required. It seems that the Joker has raised a few heads and its controversial undertones might just mean it misses out on best picture. However, for its sheer audacity it should certainly be in contention."
Accurate Portrayal of Adult Survivor - Masterpiece,"Thank you very much to the creators of ""Joker"" (2019). You have so accurately and beautifully portrayed the torment, anguish, and rage of an adult survivor of childhood trauma. I adore this film--it made me feel understood and not so alone. It is truly brilliant--a masterpiece and my favorite film of all time. I hope you take the Oscars by storm.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

So that was...quit the expierience.,"K this was an incredible work of art, not gonna beat around the bush. Jauquin pheonix is giving a career highlight here, it might be even better than his performance in the master but I'll have to think about that. Tod philips and cinematographer Laurence shaper have made a beautifully shot movie, and the shot length really gives pheonix and De Niro room to act. The camera work itself is also very well done, but its not the type off camera work that calls attention to itself like that of Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese. The blending of reality and fantasy and reality is also extremely well handled, I'm not gonna give spoilers but I will say that its kind of like American psycho and middle school:the worst years of my life (does anybody's remember that book?). It is important to mention that this movie is not for everyone, it is violent and intense, but that being said its not as violent as other art house movies like drive or hereditary. No, its not really the violence as much as the intensity and the emotion that the film evokes, which is most certainly not a complaint its a great aspect of the film. Cinifix's 10 most emotional movie moments has 2 slots in it that focus on second hand embarrassment or cringe and deep uncofortable-ness and I'd say about 87 percent of the film are squarely in those 2 spaces. Overall this movie in its own special way is a masterpiece, even if its not at all easy to watch."

Easily the most important film in recent popular culture,"The Joker may be the most important movie of this decade. This film isn't trying to cash on political correctness, virtue signaling, or any form of baiting. Yet, the film makes a powerful commentary about our modern society. The protagonist is a surprisingly relatable monster who you would root for and understand, and actually would make you believe he got the moral high ground. Beautifully shot, beautifully written, and with a truly spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix, this is a film worth watching over and over.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A real masterpiece,"Saw it yesterday and it is still replaying in my head. Loved every minute of it.
The acting was phenomenal. In some scene Joaquin was conveying several emotions at the same time with total surrender and believability. I was just in awe to see a human do this. That's acting on master level. At the same time you saw this very fragile looking human being a victim of his illness and environment and on the other this incredibly strong will (insanity ?) shining through. The cinematography was just amazing. I was drawn into this dark depressing environment but with such a visual clarity and details. I almost forgot the music. There was this cello music emphasizing dark insanity coming out drawing you further into the scenes. And during the action scenes some very fitting songs were started in perfect synchrony. Great.

Movie of the Year!,"It was pretty clear from before the movie got released that despite being a central comic book villain, Joker would not be anywhere along the lines of any superhero/super villain film we've ever seen. Instead of having the clown of Gotham going on a mad rampage to burn down the city, we witness an origin story for Joker : a story of how a normal if not slightly delusional person on being bogged down by society can turn into an uncontrollable, cold-blooded madman that we all know of.Joker's alter ego Arthur Fleck's struggles makes it immensely relatable and it is amazing to watch the character develop throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix never fails, delivering a strong performance and proving that he is one of the best, most devoted method actors in the industry.Joker rides on a simple plot fueled by a cast of extraordinary actors and a spine-chilling soundtrack which goes perfect with the protagonist's actions. With a couple of gory scenes, the movie can feel a bit heavy to handle. The movie, with beautiful cinematography ,successfully captures the essence Prince Clown of Gotham!"

MASTERPIECE,"I was highly sceptical at first regarding how the movie will turn out to be, going by the plot, I had no doubts about Joaquin, one of the best actors of his generation.
I am so unbelievably impressed by his acting, Todd's direction, the sound, the score, cinematography, the 80s vibe. Its been YEARS I've seen such a great movie with great everything in it. I can understand why some of the critics dislike this movie while they like similar or even more hardcore movies compared to this, one of the main reason has to go to the realistic feel of this movie, i have never seen acting like that ever before. The movie is so realistic and it tackles real life issues that ought to make anyone uncomfortable but in a positive way, i do not think this movie has the potential to incite gun violence etc(please, john wick anyone?), those are just rubbish.

A thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about.,"As someone who isn't that big of a fan of the DCEU thanks to the quality of the films being kind of wonky (a few are great, a few are just okay, a few are really bad), I wasn't expecting that much here, considering that this film, besides having the Joker, has nothing to even do with the DCEU. Plus, as great as Joaquin Phoenix is as an actor, he was never exactly the first guy to come to mind when thinking of who to play the demented clown himself. So, you can imagine my shock and amazement after coming out of the movie theater, because, oh my god, this film is incredible. It takes everything you thought you knew about the Joker and not only flips it on its head, but expands upon it tenfold. The way this film portrays what Arthur is going through and how he evolves into the Joker is some of the best character development I have ever seen in a film. This film has a perfect balance of making you sympathize with the main character, while also making you mindful of the terrible acts he has done. It can feel a bit disturbing to almost side with someone who's obviously dangerous, but the way this film manages that is genius. All of this is helped by two things. Smart and excellent writing, as well as the performance. The story is great. It's well paced, thought provoking, smart, poignant, and constantly almost eye opening. Joaquin Phoenix was pretty much perfect. His performance is Oscar worthy here, as he really did become the main character. When Arthur laughed because of his condition, I really felt the pain behind it. Seeing how his life is and how he lives it really seemed real, and that's what helped me sympathize with him, even though, again, he's dangerous. If all of that wasn't enough, everything else about this movie is great too. The direction from Todd Phillips really shines, as the way this film is structured and put together helps the film not only flow really well, but to be delightfully dark and twisted. The performances from everyone else were all great too. Robert De Niro was phenomenal as Murray Franklin, as he was very committed, which helped him really turn into the talk show host from this film. The same thing can be said for everyone else, whether it be Frances Conroy as Arthur's mother or Zazie Beetz as his love interest. Everyone did great, as well as Todd Phillips for making such an incredible film that delves into the mind of the demented clown while making it extremely heartfelt. I also loved how they linked the Wayne family to the story. I won't say what happened to avoid spoilers, but that really helped this feel like a true part of Batman's past, all of which happened in a movie where the caped crusader isn't even around yet (I hope, because a Batman film after this would be awesome in my opinion). Overall, this film is amazing, and I recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so, because it not only has fan service aplenty to longtime fans of the Joker, but it also has everything that makes a great movie great so that it can be enjoyed by anyone. One last thing to note is that there is a lot, and I mean a LOT of gore in this film, so if you're squeamish about that, then I'd probably wait until I'm ready to see it. I say watch this with an open mind, and what you'll experience is a thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about and tells it damn near perfectly."

A new classic,"I have to admit that I had a certain fear to this film.
The first thing I'm a big DC fan, the Joker is my favorite DC villain, and to make a movie about him without Batman, somehow illogical and unimaginable.
Second, the director is Todd Phillips who has now done only comedies (admittedly good and really good) such as Hangover, Due Date and Road Trip. I knew that Joaquin will be great as he has already proven and rewarded an actor with several great roles, but history has taught me that it's no guarantee because the last Joker was catastrophic and the actor is also a great actor (Jared Leto has an Oscar).I was so wrong.The film is perfect, crafty and brutal.
Most of all it tells me that even after three days of looking at it, I still think about him, about acting, about scenes, about music, about a possible message.
As expected, Joaquin was singled out by the big screen overall. Each scene is his own, he ate the part and ordered the desert afterwards. He brutally gave himself into it, physically and mentally. Honestly, it will be a bigger surprise if he doesn't win an Oscar, but it doesn't even matter given the award history. He showed so many emotions and layers of one fictional character on a larger level, leaning to the floor!
Any comparisons to Ledger are unnecessary, they both did the job to the highest possible level, each with their own version that fits the film. Both are perfect.
I did mind the two minor things in the movie, however they turned it around to fit the story so I have no qualms.
I really like that this can't be called some kind of superhero movie that we've been bombarded with for years, it's a pure psychological drama. It reminded me a lot of the tone and atmosphere of Taxi Driver, even in some scenes one can see the impact and similarities in Martin Scorsese's film. It was as if it was shot in the 1970s which was Hollywood's prime golden age.Honestly, the reactions of film critics, ranging from disappointment to excellent, were not clear to me. In the last few years, you may have 5 films for which you will become a cult classic in the future. The Joker is definitely one of them.Purely subjective and well deserved ten!"
A painfully thorough diagnosis,"Finally we get a Joker who is not Batman-centered, a Joker who walks his own path and tells his own story. Thank you!
This is the best 2019 movie to hit theaters and it will stay in the minds everyone who watched for a long time whether you liked or disliked it.
It's not a movie for the critics' praise, rather than a medical diagnosis of our time. Should you fail to notice the message Joker brings, you might as well surround yourself with happy thoughts and watch a Disney movie.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

An Uncomfortable Masterpiece,"'Joker' is an uncomfortable masterpiece that will leave you walking away from the movie theatre confused about how you feel. It's a conversation piece that anchors itself deep into the origins, mentality and motivations of a disturbing psychopathic anarchist.This movie isn't for everyone, especially if what you're expecting to see is a thrilling face off between a villain and a superhero. But if your going into this movie wanting to see and feel something you've never seen or felt before, then you're in for one hell of an experience.Most films will leave you with a short term emotion, this film is one of few leaving you with many long term emotions that take a while to process, and that, in my opinion, is what makes a movie deserving of 10/10.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The best and most believable Joker I have ever seen!,"I already wrote a review, but after reading afew reviews which are giving bad points and talking about violence, I decied to update my review.I want to ask these guys who are giving bad review and taling about violence.
Do you know who is JOKER? You think you come to cinema and watch Romeo and Juliet? JOKER is a criminal, one of the most scary and crazy criminals in all history. So if he takes his victims and cut their body to separate parts you shouldn't be surprised because that's JOKER. That's how it should be, nothing else. So if you can not watch it, go watch some melodrama movie
The funny thing is there are too many movies with 100 times more violence like Game of Thrones, John Wick and .... But you know why they say Joker has more Violence? Because on other movies you say, OK, that's just a movie, but in JOKER you believe it. It's so real. You live with the Joker from beginning until end and you accept and believe what he does. You never says, OK that's just a movie. You say damn it's real life. It's so real!
You feel him, you get sad for him, you have pain with him and you scare of him as hell. That's a real act and movie should be!Also never compare jokers together, all of them were good in their time and the movie they played. But the Joker Phoenix played is so real and accetbale. Is not like superhero movies. Is like yeah, that's why Joker exist. You beleive everybody can be a Joker if we had a miserable life like him. So if you go to cinema just enjoy from his act. Don't sit and say, oh Heath Ledger was better or Phoenix. Just enojy!I just saw this masterpiece first day came to cinema and all my mind is still with the movie!
My wife says, finish it!!! You are all the time talking about movie at home haha...
But that was realllllllyyyy good. An amazing masterpiece!!!
Next week I have to keep children and she goes for watching. Because now she is curious to watch what is this movie I am all the time taling about. It's a pitty we can not watch together, somebody should keep children. But soon I go for watching again.
Phoenix did the performance 10 times better than I expected. You really belive the character of Joker opposite of superhero movies. His laughs, acts and crimes ... In cinema nobody was talking, you couldn't hear even one word, even when movie finished. Everybody mind was blown away and with that silence everybody left cinema.
Thank you for such a great masterpiece!"

"Sorry Heath, you've been bumped.","I dislike the DC universe, to be frank. Justice League, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Superman are boring let downs. Chris Nolan's vision of Batman was certainly decent. Heath Ledger's Joker was compelling and certainly a worthy performance. Joaquin Phoenix has redefined this character in a way that will not be touched by anyone for a long time. This movie is a character study beyond words. I loved it. It's just amazing.I am hopeful that this blueprint will pave the way for more sophisticated adaptations for superhero/antihero movies.

Best 2019 movie so far. maybe best movie in the last 10 years,"It's a perfect movie. A character study of the crime prince that takes you inside his unhinged brain. A slow burn of a story that takes its time to unfold and takes you down into madness with Joker
Joaquin Phoenix is PERFECT, and he totally deserves an Oscar nomination for that awesome performance
The haunting soundtrack of hildur guðnadóttir totally augmented the experience of the movie
And last but not least Todd Phillips' directing which had a lot of frames that is art gallery worthy.

A punch movie for an unconscious society,"... Joker ... - From a DC Comic book: is a grandiose movie if there is one, produced in a sensational way by ""Todd Phillips"" who knew how to make an incredibly realistic human impact, without ever taking lose sight of this vision of a sick society, which despises and destroys the most vulnerable, and simply lets appear a deep evil lurking in the shadows and which feeds on the vulnerability of a growing class of the most humble of our society, which acts like a poison that slowly infuses to end up intoxicating a society that is losing more and more of all these benchmarks.The movie is brought to the zenith by the exceptional performance of Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) who bursts the screen from the first to the last frame, giving even more power to this exceptional movie.
Be careful, our society is sick and like cancer it infects the cogs of our society, which one wonders how ... it does not even realize it today.7 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

At this moment in time there are riots in other places, and you want for those people to take back control over their lives in countries where communism and dictatorship is failing them.

'Joker' is an all-time masterpiece.,"I've watched 'Joker' twice, and, I must say: this movie is an all-time masterpiece. This film is a brilliant character study of the timeless villain 'Joker.' Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Joker is incredible, and indeed is one of the greatest acting jobs I've ever seen.'Joker' is a film that leaves you with something to chew on: Should you love the Joker, and feel bad for him? Does ignoring mental health have real-life implications on individuals suffering from mental health, physical health; and coming from poor backgrounds?Most films made today do not work your mind in the way 'Joker' does.In my opinion, this film may/should change the way we make superhero and supervillain movies.'Joker' simply astonishes - and captivates audiences, as it'll leave you with your jaw stuck to the floor."
Best Joker Movie to date,"This movie.... this movie is beyond amazing! Finally seeing the origin story for the Joker makes it so much easier to understand him and why he does what he does.

Is there a need for a box-office uprising?,"You have to see this film to believe it. It's a masterpiece. More so in a world where comicbook-blockbusters and cash crabs rule Hollywood. Todd Philipps and Joaquin Phoenix did what nobody in their wildest dream could imagine: to make one of the most profitable movies with a small kind of art-house film in the DC-Batman-universe. Thanks to Philipps and Phoenix, a great many young people watched for the first time an honest movie which was made with a very special vision and told almost perfectly the story about a man struggling with life and how society interacts with him. The soundtrack alone is worth the admission. But the performance of Phoenix is out of this world. After I saw the soulless, brainless Star Wars 9 episode, I wonder when will the audience break away from movies which scripts are written from marketing and merchandising hacks.

Review joker,"Wow..........
What was that last night, I finally watched Joker.And what was that!
The movie was in my eyes fantastic.
Acting/cinematography/writing/soundtrack
I can only describe this movie in one word ""amazing"". So, let's talk about the acting of Joaquin Phoenix.
I have never see someone blend in his role like he did.
Like when he first killed those 3 guys in the subway, he had in that scene so much anger but also sadness.
It really looked like Phoenix was for real angry and sad.
And all of the other scene's, I just got the chills.
So like everyone say, he really deserve an Oscar.And then a big applause for Todd Phillips, how he write and direct this movie.
There was no second I thought when is this movie done.
The only sort of negative thing was, that the first half came up really slow.
But the second half made it good.My favorite thing about the whole movie was that sort of amusing part.
The music, the little jokes and his sentence; First I thought my life was a tragedy but actually it's a comedy.So here a summary,
Joker is a amazing movie, I am 100% sure that it is the best Dc movie that is ever made.
Acting/cinematography/writing/soundtrack are awesome.
And Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor ( btw this is the first movie that I saw with him).
And I enjoyed it so much."

At first I felt bad for the protagonist Arthur Fleck but when he starting to change into becoming the Joker I felt terrified of him which is amazing that the movie accomplished that. This movie is also not for everyone because of the lack of action and always annoys me when people saying this movie is bad with the reason of ""This movie is boring"".

ONE OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLERS.,"The film never disappoints, not one bit. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker is brilliant as hell, he lets his acting ooze out from his eyes and his body. The film is not about Joker and his violence and neither the director (Todd Philips) or the screenwriters (Todd and co-writer Scott Silver) have tried showing it that way; It istead focuses on Arthur's descent into madness, driven by his experience of society and how he finds his solace in the chaos that was indirectly started by his actions.
A must watch for every cinephile(thanks to cinematography by Lawrence Sher) and a treat to watch. Send in the clowns- the best of 2019 is here ! And also, the 2nd best of the decade (only behind Inception).5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

If you're expecting your typical comic book-y Joker vs Batman, good vs evil kind of thing you will be disappointed. This is a study of REAL human madness, it's a critic of modern society, it's as real as it gets. Joker is a flawless movie, by far the greatest masterpiece of 21st century, and I am expecting at least one Oscar. And if it gets a sequel as good as this, that sequel deserves Oscar too.

A true masterpiece. Heath Ledger would've been proud.,"Joaquin Phoenix absolutely killed the movie (no pun intended) with his fantastic performance as Joker. The movie was beautiful and was smartly shot, if you're a person who notices small details like me, you'll be amazed by the details that were presented, like the colour scale in each scene as there was a specific pattern in that. The build-up in the background music also hinted how the character was developing until it reached the ""max level"" let us say. Even the scenes that were supposedly real, but turn out to be only a hallucination inside the mind of Arthur (Joker).
Moreover, despite what some people didn't like this movie just because it was too violent and showed that it was praising the evil and violence, while the real message is actual and should be taken seriously as we witness it from time to time, especially in school mass shootings. People don't end up killing the other all of a sudden, it is all built up from continuous bullying and getting abused, and when those people seek for help in mental health services lets say, they should really help them not just listening to them, asking the same questions over and over then give them medication which can get them addicted at some point."

In the case of Donald Trump, this character may be, if we analyze the film from a political point of view, very discreetly combined politics and art.

Unreal,"Before you go to watch the movie you think it's gonna be overhyped, but no it lives up to all expectations! Firstly the acting is amazing amazing Mr. Phoenix may just get shortlisted for the Oscar IMO! The plot packs a punch at every twist and every turn, for me there was never ever a dull moment. I'm not going to go into much detail you have to see it to believe it an absolute masterpiece! THATS LIFE.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A movie you could watch again and again,"I'll be honest , I didn't think Joaquin Phoenix was going to be right for the role, I kept thinking of his role in Signs and Gladiator when I first heard that he would be playing the joker several months ago. DC having changed direction with its movies and flavour , the joker Heath Ledger played was a new level of amazing that probably wouldn't have ever been matched but I think that dark and chaotic feel really came out with this movie, It made you really empathise for the joker .it felt very real and it showed how Gotham created the joker .Great movie , best I've watched all year.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Joaquin Phoenix, take a bow","There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats."
'You don't really understand an antagonist until you understand why he's a protagonist in his own version of the world',"Such a sad movie with a consuming psychological depth. a dark portrayal of a character with an iconic and sorrowful laugh, who slowly collapses under the pressuring circumstances. great soundtracks and beautiful acting.
it seems to be an everyday tragic but it still touches you in a new and different way of raw & haunting reality. the best part: another interpretation of the joker. his disoriented and ""unintentionally"" actions are full of desperation, (always had a weak spot whenever I saw people hurting inside, and he definitely hit that). it really feels like the beginning of all - of how arthur becomes the joker.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Although everyone's entitled....,"Although everyone's entitled to their own opinion and that's totally understandable and everything but to the people who are bashing this masterpiece by saying it is showing ""irresponsible violence"", it ""mocks mental illness"" and all that, I'll just say read or know about comics first and then watch this movie, go home, think, and watch it again just to appreciate the sheer brilliance that this movie portrays in terms of acting, direction, cinematography, the background score and what not!
I'm not saying that everyone has to read comics before watching this movie I'm just suggesting that before bashing this piece of art, know about the character, it's story arc what it stands for, it's history and all that.

"Realistic Origin & Amazing, Gritty Performance","The film starts off slow but straight off the bat, compelling, interesting look into the life of Arthur Fleck, Joker. It is unclear whether or not this is the Infamous Joker aka Batman's nemesis. Without trying to spoil anything, it is unclear whether or not some parts of this origin are true or not, and this is because of an unreliable narrator/main character. This is what makes this movie stand out just as plenty of other stories do as well. The ability to give the audience/reader a chance to analyze the material and theorize themselves what it is that is being discussed or viewed. It was honestly an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It was reminiscent of Ledger's haunting performance that was truly one of a kind. And so is Joaquin's. It was a psychological masterpiece of not only the development of a character (one of the best like walter white level, and Joker is just a 2 hr movie) but the cinematography that made this mental breakdown come to life. I don't know whats up with the critics, but they definitely got this one wrong.I don't believe this needs a sequel... this is by far the greatest origin story for a mysterious villain arch storyline. And this coming from a Wolverine fan, Logan was great, this was superior... all we need is a Punisher Origin story, in the idea of Platoon. Joker deserves a 9.7."

The Origin Story Joker Deserves,"I came into this movie with the highest scepticism. Partly because Heath Ledger's Joker was my favourite movie character of all time and i coulnd't see how somebody would come close to it. But Joaquin did, BIG TIME. Because you see, Dark Knigh'ts Joker was a badass dude, crazy at times, but this, this was something else. I saw people come in with kids, i also read people are hating on it for being too violent and triggering. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? This movie is about Joker, the prince of darkness, the craziest of them all. I had been waiting for a movie like this in years!!! Thank you Joaquin Phoenix!!!

In your face call for justice that upsets the corrupt elite,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a bad faith defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their charade might get uncovered. Joker might be delusional, but it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypocrites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is."

Masterpiece,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)"

Powerfull Movie!,"This movie is a masterpiece. If you ever were bullied or have had depressions and felt like everybody is against you, you will feel with the joker through the whole movie.
This movie is unsettling from the get go and gets only worse from there on (but in a good way:)). As we witness how the character - Arthur Fleck, who will become the joker - is gradually sinking into insanity, caused by the selfish and cold world he lives in and by his own psyche.
The role of the Joker is delivered brilliantly by Joaquine Phoenix, who in my opinion, deserves an oscar for it.But beware!

"Certainly not the most uplifting film to watch during this pandemic, but...","Of all films to watch during this pandemic when a comedy would have been more feasible, but I thought, 'hey, why not!' And I was curious to learn what all the hype was regarding Joaquin's performance in this film. Now I know why! He was brilliant and more than deserving of an Oscar for his performance as Joker.This film is of a controversial nature with a bleak and disturbing storyline that centers around a psycho who is sick and eventually turns to evil. No spoiler about the Joker, most folks know the story. Joaquin Phoenix cleverly manipulates the viewer's emotions with either disgust,hatred, or empathy toward the character, Arthur/Joker. I empathized with Arthur. Some people might find the subject matter too much to handle. Be it as it may, the storyline is so engaging and flows so well that you have no choice but to watch the movie to the end. Everything made sense as to how and why the Joker came to be. Outstanding production and cast!Joaquin's got a reputation for being odd. I think part of it is an act; maybe not. I don't care. I don't need to know what he does or did behind the scenes or why he decided to do this project. All I know is this man is an extremely intense and stellar actor. I also have to applaud the entire cast ensemble who was great as well, but Joaquin stands out among them all. He put his entire being into this character showing the viewer that yes, the character, Arthur had reasons for being the tormented soul that he was, and the story shows how cruel and uncaring people can be, not to mention Arthur's mother who was sick in more ways than one, both living in Gotham City ravaged with piling garbage and big, fat rats! First there is Arthur, the clown, then enter Joker!I could think of a couple of other actors who would have done a great job in this role such as Christian Bale and even Sam Rockwell. Both are outstanding actors and right up there on my favorites list, but I'm glad this role went to Joaquin Phoenix. He excels!"
The best anti-system movie,"The movie is more about society and about the victims of this society rather than about one single person and his cruelty. And the oppressors are the state institutions which don't care about unwealthy, unhealthy and alone citizens and just call them ""clowns"" following the rules of the jungles. As a result, those ""clowns"" raised against the system and started to talk to it in its language, the language of violence and power.

Powerful social critique - not some mindless 2 hour distraction,"There's something I just absolutely LOVE about this movie. It totally flips the hero/villain genre on its head. Where do villains come from? Who is the real source of evil? Urban criminals? The destitute? Those envious of the ""success"" of the ""wealthy""? Those ""unwilling"" to ""work hard"" to ""the top""? Or those in power who hoard most of the money and serve corporations before communities/individuals? Those who know how to manipulate the masses, sitting behind desks getting paid an absurdly disproportionate salary while everyone else is discardable and does all the hard work for the least pay.What if those we would vilify are simply products of a broken system? Is there some wisdom in our dark sides? I don't know about you, but this refreshing narrative seems a helluva lot more convincing than anything taught to our children about the nature of ""good"" and ""evil"", ""us"" and ""them"", and the idea that wealth, freedom and happiness is remotely within reach of anyone who has a selfless heart. Yet there's an irony in those who hoard all the money in calling others selfish, in making sure that this capitalistic narrative perpetuates into the next generation.Perhaps all the superhero stories have had it wrong all this time, who the real hero is, and who the real villain is. I love this exploration of our (cultural) shadow."
Masterpiece,"I would say that I agree with most, but not because I conform with the masses but because I enjoy an amazing movie that shows the depths of the actors/actor of the movie! Joaquin did an amazing job of characterizing what we always needed to know about Joker! We know Joker as the ""villain,"" but do we know why or how he became a villain or the bad guy? I enjoyed the movie so much that it made me happy! ""Don't forget, that's life!""4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Art at its absolute finest,"I'm 39 years old but kind of wish I was still in college so I could dedicate a very long paper to this movie and get an A+. Not because I'm that good of a writer, but more because the prescient themes in this movie have my brain working over time and I'm inspired to put pen to paper. This is a movie that will make you think. It's not formulaic in that cheesy Hollywood way. The villain isn't all bad the heroes are flawed if there are any. Our society is sick and this movie in the most artful way exposes the disease. The word that keeps coming to my mind is irreverent. Comedians are irreverent. What has working hard and playing by the rules netted most Americans???

Outstanding.,"I don't know what you call this, but it's not a movie. This is like.. biblical. It's like hearing a pastor preach about bible stories and then one day, God shows up and reveals what actually, and really happened, and it blows your mind away on levels you never before imagined. That's what this is. It is revealing and I'm not sure why the Director / Producers would do what they have done here, with this Masterpiece. They have laid strokes NO ONE can follow today. They will have to watch what they eat, what they drink, where they go, 24/365 security for them now. They have done this to themselves because envy is a hell of a thing.

Masterpiece,"Very very very good, at first i was counting with another reinvented history of a villain that will not match to a another batman movie. Not only does it continue a new movie, it also gives a new perspective to a new, crazier, more psychopath batman movie, without those cgi things.

A true masterpiece,"Joker is one of the best movie i've seen in 2019. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix is top class and of next level. He steals the show. He has buried himself deeper into the character. So much that it looks even more real than the Joker itself(Lmao, but serious ly). This movie also rasies a question that should rebel be considered as a crime?Watch this masterpiece at least once in your life. It will surely change your view on a hero and a villian.

Pure acting magic,"This was among the top 5 movies I've ever seen. I found joaquins performance both entertaining and disturbing. On the one hand, you're laughing at his social ineptitude, saying ""oh that joker, always trying to fit in"" but as the plot unfolds, you find yourself picking your jaw up off the ground. And the camera work, it just accents his amazing performance. Someone said this movie spiraled from start to finish and they were not kidding.

Take a city tour in Joker's Taxi,"Make no mistake, this is not a supervillan superhero movie. It's a powerful introspection about all of us sad clowns, dysfunctionally coping with life by putting on a happy face and not being so serious about the things we encounter.Phoenix realistically embodied the descend of a broken man into the darkness of insanity, a deep inner place where all societal norms get reformulated and endless second chances are born. Radical ideas like these can easily be interpreted as grandious avantgarde visions, and mobilize cultish fanatical followers - just as many Jokers thruought our history have demonstrated.Although it is commonly believed that the ""freaks"" come out at night when society falls asleep, we should ask ourselves who the real freaks of this world are - just like Travis Bickle did at the end of Taxi Driver.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Absolute definitive artistic masterpiece,"Its been a long time since ive seen such a cinematic masterclass. Maybe even the best ive seen?
I was always a big nut on the 90's Batman movies, the older cartoons and such. This movie however stands on its own.Now let me know whats not grand about this flick.
The pace, story, style, vibe, mood, script, art style, camera work, lighting, actors, directors are as good as it gets here.Then theres the political aspects. Is he a hero or a villain. I guess empathy cuts both sides of the importance of this movie in the 21st century.Watch this movie with attention and submission.
The payout is rewarding as it is entertaining.
We all have a bit of a joker inside of us if you like it or not.That's life..."
Amazed,"Best movie created in a long long time. It gives chills and shivers. Capturing character development. It left hunger for more of this character.

Phoenix gives one of the most refreshing performances of the decade.,"The Joker is as breathtaking as ever under Todd Phillips' command. Follow the tragic untold story that begins with a mentally ill comedian who has an unsettling medical condition that makes him suffer from pathological laughter. Embark on this twisted voyage and prepare to be changed forever when you enter a world of misery, disdain and progressive human degradation.This psychological thriller depicts Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to be accepted by a callous society while working as a clown in the freezing cold streets and enduring horrid beatings to keep his job. The only gateway to optimism which helps him maintain his sanity is his lifelong dream and ambition to become a professional comedian. Motivated by the lack of humanity in those around him, he takes a radical turn and joins a dark path that later leads him to becoming the Joker. As from that moment, he can but witness his life being shattered in front of him.Director Todd Phillips, who's best known for his contribution to the comedic side of the cinema with productions like 'The Hangover' trilogy, does a 180 degree turn diving deep into a universe defined by chaos and crime. His latest film is by far the most complex he has ever been involved in. He has previously stated during multiple interviews that the film is not connected to the DCEU and the lack of any other DC comics' characters- besides a young Batman- was probably one of the cleverest ideas for the plot. Doing so, the film gains a certain gravity that is beneficial for the character and is best suited if the Joker is in some way 'separated' from the others.A true piece of art, ""Joker"" is not a typical comic book origin story. It brings so much to the table, paving a new path for future DC adaptations of such accuracy and importance. With a script as unpredictable as its protagonist, it makes it very difficult for audiences to disapprove of Phillips' signature style of co-writing and directing. His work of great precision is centered around essential little details regarding Arthur's life and hidden origins. Phillips will most definitely take centre stage at the Academy Awards this year considering the magnitude of his latest project.Joaquin Phoenix will take the Oscars by storm, thanks to his brave portrayal that is magnificent, as well as oddly exhilarating. Despite being regarded as a bold choice for the part by some, Phoenix gives one of the most refreshing performances of the decade, adding an exciting new edge to the character- sensitivity. Watching him go through pain, loneliness and sorrow triggers emotions of considerable depth that undeniably affect each member of the audience.As soon as he steps into character, his uniqueness is complimented by the original score and cold-toned cinematography. A vintage set reminiscent of ""Taxi Driver"", an eerie soundtrack composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir and an epic script put together by a true perfectionist are just a few of the distinctive features of the film. Without a doubt the strongest contender for this year's Academy Award statuette, ""Joker"" tells the disturbing story of a lonely man who lost all his hope while unsuccessfully attempting to fit in a hostile society."
"Wow! Not your usual ""pandering to your ego"" nonsense movie","It makes you feel like you could have gone down the wrong path and empathize with him. There are a ton of would be jokers out there who have been tormented day in and day out, and now you see what happens when one of them has had enough. I used to think Joker was a psychopath. Hardly! He's simply a mentally ill (borderline personality disorder and schizophrenic ) person pushed to the edge. This could almost serve as a foretelling of what could truly happen if we don't try to help people now, who go through this kind of abuse.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A goddamn masterpiece,"If you're here for a joker story this is not for you. It's a character development movie. The trailer tells you exactly what the movie is about. It's a bout Arthur Fleck becoming the joker. But that's not why it's great. It's great because Hawken Phoenix shows you how a person changes. Everything is rooted in reality and everything that happens is very beliveable not because what is actually happening is believeable but because Arthur believes it to be. This is a great movie that can be interperated to eternity. Director Todd Phillips really went for gold here. He created an amazing universe which this movie can exist in. You don't know if any of the things that happens really happened or if it's just in Arthur's head. Damn everyone should se this movie. I've seen it 3 times in cinema, but I want to see it again.

One Word Describes this film... Masterpiece,"As a kid growing up Joker was my favorite superhero villain and I always enjoyed seeing the different ways he was portrayed as. That being said, nothing tops this film. Phoenix gives one of the best performances of any film I have ever seen in my life. The writing is absolutely enchanting, dark, tight and extremely engaging. This movie blends psychological thriller, with crime mystery, and overall dark drama. The original score is about as perfectly made for a film as it can possibly get. Whenever it came on I notice the effect of the slow burn increasing suspense my heart rate would increase. The pacing in this movie is just fantastic, it flys by so quickly. I am still taking everything in, the symbolic elements, the meaning of it all and the ending especially the ending which is worth the price of admission. Joker is an extremely dark, and emotionally intense film that really is a lot to take in but it is so well done. Masterpiece!!!!

This movie is hauntingly beautiful.,"When I went to the theatre to see this movie, I was expecting an ordinary movie about a DC villian. But what I saw was way, way more than that. Not only does it show Joker's origin but also shows how society treats people who are a bit different from them. Todd Phillips did an amazing job presenting the little details that show Aurther Fleck's degrading mentality. And the way the music and camera shots emphasises that idea is nothing short of remarkable. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an oscar-winning performance, which made the movie something I will remember for the rest of my life.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Speechless,"To be 100% honest with you guys, I'm writing a review about it right now in the movie theater, right after the movie. And all I can say is that I do not know what to say. And the only question in my mind right now is ""Is this just as good as the Dark Knight, or The Godfather I and II?
Probably not, but it's extremely close. This movie is a great example of how a plot can be so simple, yet so brilliantly done at the same time. The actors, the intense score, and it brings a huge message to today's society by telling us what these so called ""celebrities"" and ""tolerant"" people think of us. The answer is NOTHING. And this is one of many reasons as to why some people go crazy and have their own lives destroyed for other people's entertainment. This movie also does a very good job by showing both sides of the story. The side of the rich, and the side of the poor. You can feel like you are in their shoes and that may be the biggest reason as to why this film is so great. It's realistic and relatable to anyone that has been in this situation. All I can say is, just go watch it in the theaters, and feel the movie for yourself. 98/100, so pretty much flawless.
FYI, for me the only flawless movie ever made is The Godfather I."
It is scary to cheer for the twisted ones,"Let's ignore the phenomenal acting, directing, script, filmography, special effects etc.. You could read about those elements anywhere else.People hate or worship the Joker movie for the same reason, on its superficial level, it glorifies the madmen, the lost, the pillars of capitalism that went astray and as a viewer you might do the same, asking yourself, should I hate the Batman now? No, you are not crazy.It seems that due to non-biological, cultural-related life circumstances, the only way that Arthur Fleck could fulfill himself is to become the Joker, a title that is a part of the movie's strongest underlying, Arthur didn't choose his destiny or his new name and identity, society's strongest did and it seems like there are many people like him or at least people that identify with him as seen in the street of Gotham in the last hour of the movie.I will watch this movie as many times as I watched Pulp Fiction, maybe more, and to think that there is only one significant character in it ( OK maybe De Niro's character is important, but they are all important)"

His performance in this film as Joker is nothing less than Oscar-worthy. I never thought I would actually be #teamjoker but I am. I'm not a comic reader so of course I never judge a movie based off of that. It was beautifully directed, and pointed a grim picture of what led up to Joker becoming Joker. Twists and turns in every direction. People complained that it took awhile to get going. NOT TRUE. I'm not going to go into a full synopsis of the film because you can read that on the main page. I'm just giving my thoughts. Best film of the year...if not the last 5 years that I have had the pleasure of watching. Movies have been trash lately, so its nice to finally see a gem like this.

Comic book story telling for adults and intellectuals,"Great performances from all involved. Phillips is awesome with telling the story he wanted and leaving room for interpretation. Expressing his own feelings of society. Conveying it through the tragic story of a person having been beaten by society, now choosing the wrong path. Letting go and giving into his own sick and twisted perspective of the world that treated him so brutally. Returning the hate and anger bestowed upon him. It's sad and wonderful, mischievous and marvelous all at the same time. As an avid comic book, movie , joker, nerd. I felt Joaquin captured his darkness that grew from innocence to violence. His quirks and ticks are exactly what I imagined a live Joker to be, without being cheesy. you see him immerse himself into the madness that lives with the Joker and becomes apart of you as you follow the rabbit hole of the joker. Great stuff, fascinating approach.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Don't see it as a DC film.,"Focus on Arthur. This film is on point with what they want told. I've seen movies that deals with the same idea, but this is just a lecture.A very human society revolves around Arthur and sends him down a path full of conflicts and challenges. To understand why this representation of society can be considered normal, you have to see that this is what our contemporary generation has led to. Everything in this film is normal, normal because it happens and happened. We try to prevent it but its so normalized that it still happens. The problem isn't because of having either mental issues or normal issues, its the fact that we consider them two different things, and forget that the simple concept was to comfort the ones who are going through tough times, and just be there for them.We have opened a network of wrongs and it will keep on breeding more wrongs, until we choose to stop and do something about it."
Unbelievable!,"So I made an account and I am about to give my first ever movie review because of this film.I'm not a critic and Don't know much about the intricacies of cinema but what I can say is this is a damn good movie, I've never watched a movie so perfect before in my life. Honestly I thought this movie was gonna be a flop but I've never been so glad to be wrong.First off this is a terrifyingly real depiction of mental health, I have depression and was nearly in tears multiple times through this movie because I could feel everything that brought the character Arthur down. My favourite thing about this movie is the music, it's a truly scary score that blends well with the overall tone of the movie, every time you hear the music play you get an overpowering sense of dread and fear of what's about to happen. The violence hits hard but isn't over the top and makes you wonder what more this character is capable of. Never before have I seen pacing so perfect in film, it goes from 0 to 100 so slowly yet so quickly making you realise just how serious Arthur's mental state really is. The only thing wrong with this movie is the feeling of needing more!In the end Joker is the best film I have ever seen, it hits hard and leaves you wanting more from Joaquin Phoenix's exceptional performance that haunted my thoughts for days, I've been to see it 3 times now and my thoughts haven't changed. I truly hope to see this iteration of the Joker again in a sequel or even a cameo for any future projects. Hats off to the director and every person involved in this film, it was beyond perfect!"
Holy Cesar Romero's Moustache...!,"I always go to the one-star reviews first, as the ten star reviews of movies I like will just echo what I think. I like to see what someone who DIDN'T like the movie has to say - ""OK, convince me"".
The one-star reviews are hilarious - they range from the ""I'm different to everyone else!"" cries for attention to the jealous, possessive moans of those people who think that THEIR character or story has been taken from them and turned into something they don't like. Basically no-one convinced me - I didn't read a single thing that maybe think ""Hmm, maybe they have a point. I hadn't noticed that"".
For this is a perfect movie. Even to a superhero agnostic like me. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix beggars belief - from his physical transformation to the acting turn he puts in. I can't imagine anyone in the history of acting portraying this character to such devastating effect. I won't go on, because, as I said, it has all been said in other reviews - suffice to say that I'll be amazed if another movie tops this in my view in 2019. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might have run it close with 20 minutes shaved off but as it stands, Joker reigns supreme, awards season notwithstanding.
I wondered why the left had took agin this movie, which is no more or less violent than many movies, superhero or no. (And speaking of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I heard someone on a podcast say they walked out when someone started inflicting violence on a woman. (This was a woman intent on slaughtering people, including an unborn child) So you waited till ten minutes from the end to stage your big protest!?) Then I found out. Apparently Todd Phillips said ""Woke culture has killed comedy"". Big mistake! The memo went out. The Hive Mind was apprised. Nothing he did was ever to be favourably reviewed again. Good. More room in the cinema for me."
One of the best movies of all time,"Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal.

"He wasn't laughing, he was crying.","Do not expect a fast paced action adventure. This is a different kind of movie to the usual DC/Marvel stuff. This is a pure psychological thriller of epic proportions with incredible character development. It is already one of my favourite all time movies. It is an instant classic which is becoming somewhat of a rarity these days.This is a pure origin story of how Arthur Fleck slowly became The Joker. In fact it isn't really much about The Joker at all, but rightly more about Arthur Fleck. Joaquin Phoenix has given us the most human version of the character yet as he slowly descends into insanity. If he doesn't win an oscar for this then just scrap the awards altogether.It really raises empathy about mental health issues, what it is like struggling day to day living with the loneliness and stigmas of poor mental health within a cruel heartless society, and for Arthur who we learn also has empathy too for the underdog. This is definitely not a comic book flick. I am no huge Batman fan, but I am now a big fan of The Joker. I left the cinema feeling that I learned something new about myself. He wasn't laughing, he was crying."

Todd Phillips just graduated to the big leagues,"Looking at this from a business perspective...the career move that director Todd Phillips made was brilliant. It was a brilliant move but I wasn't totally certain it would make for a brilliant film - I wasn't sure if he had it in him. As he's stated in recent interviews, he hit a point where he felt he could no longer make crude comedies for an American audience, which is what he's been known for (The Hangover trilogy, Old School, etc), and I feel that completely. So where do you go from there? Considering comic book movies are one of the only types of movies that get large production budgets in 2019, he takes an iconic comic book character, takes one of the most intense and interesting A-list actors we have working, and instead of making another carbon-copy, commercialistic, and fully forgettable CGI-fest full of fart jokes and giant robots getting knocked over, he makes a movie with some actual psychological depth! What a way to work around this troubled system! One must generally adapt in order to capitalize.As far as the film itself, I knew Phillips and Phoenix would create something entertaining, but I could not have expected the sheer masterpiece they pulled off. From every angle... the writing, the directing, the editing, the photography, the pacing - it's all impeccable and I am beyond impressed. There's not a dull moment and every single scene plays an important role in the tension-building and the unfolding of every little plot element. And, of course, the acting... this could be very well be the greatest performance of Joaquin Phoenix's career, which is a colossal statement considering his mountain of phenomenal films, and the fact that he might be my #1 of this era. Literally every shot where Phoenix is on the screen disperses an outpour of complex emotions - never just one, always a smorgasbord, like when you've eaten half an eighth of mushrooms and they've just begun kicking in, and you feel entirely overwhelmed. There were more psychological twists than I was expecting and they had me pretty stirred up as they piled atop each other.As far as all the negative press around this movie, I find it all almost entirely off base and misdirected. Sarcastic comments like ""Finally, a movie for angry white men who can't get everything they want""... as if there has never been any other films about any psychopaths, maniacs, criminals, or serial killers who also happen to be white men, which have been praised endlessly for decades? Simultaneously we have oodles of people praising shows like MINDHUNTER, with no negative press, while JOKER is getting attacked. They are both about the same thing...psychotic serial killers. That's what this is... an intricate character study about a blossoming psychopath and killer, which also happens to include a multitude of themes that can be aligned with societal obstacles we are currently facing in reality. Yes, you put yourself in the villain's shoes, and you feel fractions of the pain that villain is feeling, but the point is not to GLORIFY or CELEBRATE such darkness, but rather to wallow in it just long enough to feel disrupted then get the hell out of there and go back to your normalcy. JOKER has a lot of heart, a lot of blood pumping through it's veins, and a working brain too - it's actually the most human movie I have seen this year, with the most depth.I could say a lot more, but I will wrap up instead. I had a smile plastered across my face for 75% of this movie, as I was constantly blown away by either some element of what I was seeing. The other 25% I was scared, sad, or excited - but I was never bored. Not for a second. Every MOMENT was stimulating, and meticulously crafted. This is actually one of the only truly masterful movies I have EVER seen based off of a comic book character - not only is it special in that sense, but it's also boosted Todd Phillips to the league of legendary filmmakers. I'm curious to see if this is a chance one-off, or if Phillips will carry on as a dramatic filmmaker, after going above and beyond with this one. 10 out of 10, in my opinion."
Wow.,"I'm astonished at this movie. I went in with high expectations and it blew them away! While I was even watching it I kept telling myself what an amazing movie.

One of the greatest origin stories ever,"This film is about a man who begins to start a crippling downfall with his own sanity and mental state. Believe the hype and excitement over this movie, never before have I ever seen a movie use such gut-wrenching realism to it's advantage before. With little to no issues with the movie itself, this movie is up there with the top movies of this year or dare I even say top movies of the decade. Understanding the complexity of the psychological mind of a human as he/she goes through various levels of distress shows how impossibly intelligent this film is.

Phenomenal acting. Joachim Phoenix can make even Gotham feel sad,"I don't think it is a coincidence that Robert de Niro was an actor in this movie. Joker plays more like Taxi Driver than any movie I've seen. The same slow descent into madness for a disillusioned and ignored man at the edge of society.I didn't find the film political at all. Because what Phoenix did I felt for his character at a visceral level, beyond good, evil and morality. The entire movie is a joke that only some people get it. The incel thing, for example, was hilarious in retrospect: frightened first worlders trying to instantly put a label on the people that they feared most and needed support more. The exact same reaction as portrayed in the film. The story in this is very personal, in a social context that becomes a constant buzz that fades in the background.If there is any word that could describe Joker is uncomfortable. It's two hours of feeling the suffering of the main character, even as he breaks and does unconscionable things. You can't not root for him. You can't condone it. You can't not be sad. And in the end, when I was thinking this is a great movie but has nothing to do with the DC comics, it ties in the Batman classic storyline with such ease that I couldn't help shivering thinking on what Batman's story would be in this universe of burning sadness.Bottom line: great acting and really fresh ideas that work together perfectly. It's a very adult film, though, and not for everybody."
Best movie of the year,"Yes, sir.
Joker develops the true meaning of ""character"".
Character in Latin is a synonym for persona, ie ""person"".
But what would a soulless person be?
Probably a caricature.
Something that only exists on a canvas.That's exactly the typical Joker from Batman movies.
A creation that can only be found on a movie screen.
For sure, it's a captivating character, but soulless.
Nobody knows why he is a villain in fact.
In Batman movies, Joker is just there committing crimes, like a puppet.Not here.
What makes a person a villain?
How to give a soul to such a villain?
In real life, a psychopath/ sociopath is a natural born killer or he is shaped like that by his own world.
The proposal of this movie is to give a compelling life to a villain character.Undoubtedly, this is the best movie of 2019: great screenplay, awesome direction and a perfect acting of a soulful character."

The Pranker,"Dude so this movie is what I would call good. Like there is so much plot in it and it gets intense which makes it intresesting and thot-provoking. Literally though two scantily clad females tried feeling me up during the film and I was like ""dude NOT cool save it for the battle bus"". But yeah anyway so Wakeen Feenix does a nice job playing the joker I mean the pranker I mean Arthur. He's got issues and he ain't afraid to show it. But yeah dude so I'm watching the movie and I was really just thinking the whole time like wow this movie is good. Like when Batman appears i thought oh my god this is like in Godzilla king of the monsters which I saw with the boys in imax on May 31st during the scene where the guy rides gkdzilla's titanic pecker. But yeah and also joker dances but I sat next to these two DUMB kids of dark descent The second time I viewed the movie and I had a throwdown with them cause they were laughing during my movie.

Serious film representing good theatre and writing is back....I hope. Phoenix is superb. I did not want to take my eyes off him in case I missed a facial twitch or expression. He builds on Heath Ledger's Joker and takes it to the stratosphere and beyond. It will be too close to home for a lot of Americans who don't want to face up to obscene wealth, homelessness, mental illness, poor medical cover and gun insanity. But see it.....it's marvellous!

"I made an account to write this review, and this review alone.","This movie is haunting, to say the least. It is not for the faint of heart. That being said, it is probably the single most powerful piece of cinematic art I've ever seen. The storyline, cinematography, facial expressions, symbolism, acting: all perfect as far as I'm concerned. Take a dark look into how abandoned people only fall deeper into abandonment as a family, community, and society neglects to acknowledge their suffering. If this movie doesn't force you to self-reflect-- both in relation to the joker and those who treated him poorly-- nothing will.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Oh wow!!,"What a great movie and what a performance of Joachim Phoenix.
People who don't like this movie please next time go to a CGI packed no brainer Marvel movie because this movie is totally different.
I didn't even see it as an superhero movie because there aren't any in here.

"A masterpiece, with one of the best character development I have ever scene","This film has the criteria to be the first film with a main character that can stand alone and increase the element of suspense without the need of multiple character crosses.Think of it for a moment, There is no a single scene that will make you question the characters choices. And man... the way they developed the Joker here is magnificent, with a mind-blowing performance from Joaquin and a great cinematography... this is by far the best movie I have seen in years !10/105 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
What is with the metascore for this movie?,"This movie packs some of the best performances we have seen in years. The script is great, dialogues, sound, cinematography and what not, all just outstanding. But i am surprised to see such a low metascore. Why are the critics not happy with it? I heard it somewhere that the critics are not happy with the violence in the movie. Well this movie has less than 10% voilence in the last Tarintino movie which was completly pointless as far as the story goes. But yet ""Once Upon a Time in Holywood"" scored so well in metascore. Compared to that, this movie should have scored an above 85 in metascore. Are the critics sold to Disney to sabotage any DC/WB based movie?5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"A PERFECT, DARK, THRILLING, SHOCKING, POSITIVLY DISTURBING, MASTERPIECE!!!","I love this film so much! I saw this film and this is seriously one of the best films ever!!! This movie is perfect! I'm definitely gonna buy it on blu-ray! Everything about this film is just perfect and is the acting! Joaquin Phoenix needs to continue portraying as the Joker in the rest of the films where they will have the Joker because Phoenix is the TRUE JOKER. He is a huge difference than the other Joker actors in the past. He is so much better than anyone else! This film and Joaquin Phoenix are so amazing, so brutal, so dark, so thriller, so entertaining, so shocking, so watchable, so enjoyable!!! I rate this film a 10 out of 10! I'm gonna be very upset if they dont give Joaquin Phoenix an oscar because he deserves it!!! He is an incredible actor!! I'm also gonna be upset if they dont continue using Joaquin Phoenix to portray as the Joker in the films because he is the only actor who does a perfect job as the Joker! GIVE JOAQUIN PHOENIX AN OSCAR! CONTINUE FILMS WITH JOAQUIN PHOENIX AS THE JOKER!5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"A mesmorizing character study, with a brilliant performance from Pheonix","As you've probably heard by now, Joker is a comic book film unlike anything we've ever seen before. It chooses to focus on it's iconic lead character in a very down to earth, dark and twisted story that mostly stays far away from any sort of storyline found in the Batman comics. This film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who slowly descends into madness and revolts against the world around him.
Joaquin Phoenix is incredible in this. He portrays Arthur in with so many subtle movements and expressions that makes Arthur feel like a real person. Phoenix even stamps his own name on Joker's laugh, ensuring it stands out from everyone else. He's in every single scene, and he eats up every minute of the runtime.
This character is incredibly complex, and every scene portrays his descent into madness. It will be a film that will likely require multiple viewings to catch every detail. The film can be slow but every scene is important to Arthur's breakdown and by the end of the film, you will see a character that has become completely full circle. It's incredible to watch in a movie that will be remembered for a very, very long time."

The real oscar worty joker,"First thing first i waited for this movie to be aired as soon as possible.Indeed the producer's read my mind and released it 2 earlier in our country (india).To my expectations the movie went above the expectations. Phoenix rocked the whole jokers character itself. The story of the movie is satisfying for the audience and indeed the dialogue, comic timings, cinematography, score and all other.
Movie starts with joker already getting a bad day. The story becomes more and more intense as the movie rolls on. We can feel the tense and the good thing about the movie is its Gotham city's atmosphere.. Its chilling and interesting to watch the development of jokers character till the second half.
And oh dear the 2nd half of the movie is mesmerizing and top of the game.
Goosebumps all over when phoenix becomes joker .
The dance and laughs we can't miss .
Everytime joker laughs there is something for the audience
Also the timing of the laughs is perfect.To sum up the movie is itself a masterpiece with phoenix at his performance of all time.
Go and see it yourself and be glad like me"

I never want to end up face to face with Joaquin.

This was a perfect picture from start to finish.I kept thinking that his make up wasn't doing justice for the ""Joker"", but then remembered, hello, this is the making of, so of course...I'm just glad he will finally win his long-awaited Academy Award.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

An Honest Review: Cinematic Piece of Art,"This movie is the first to actually compel me to begin writing reviews. First of all, yes, this movie is great, but I wanted to give it a fair score unlike what it's been given by the mainstream. It is as if the majority of the people writing such reviews haven't even seen the movie themselves. No this movie does not invoke or persuade anarchist violence, nor is it meant to be the happy/feel-good type that many super hero movies portray. This is a movie of the devolution of man, who happens to fit into the comic book fiction world of Gotham. Don't bring your children to see this, it is not meant for them - it is meant for those mature enough to understand an amazing character study that Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix place on the big screen. This movie was one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in years, one that kept me engrossed from beginning to end without falter. Please do yourself a favor and see this movie, and don't read the critics' reviews. They're just degenerates looking for a big hit headline. Joker is 10/10, up there with the likes of Taxi Driver.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Brilliant as both a comic book movie and a stand-alone movie.,"I've never seen a movie (with the possible exception of The Force Awakens and The Incredibles 2) to be as hyped as this with both good and bad things emanating from that. Ever since the first trailer came out in April, I've been waiting to see it. I knew that this wouldn't be like any other comic book movie I'd seen up to that point (I've yet to see Logan and Watchmen). And indeed, from the trailers it looked like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which also star Robert De Niro. Even still, Joker perfectly encapsulates everything about the character. The Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate. The movie gives a believable and more than fitting backstory for the Joker. If not than you could look at it as the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) just an unfortunate and deluded man with aspirations of being a comedian who endured one too many kicks in the teeth. It is a comic book movie but more dark and gritty than any I've ever seen, including The Dark Knight. I often don't like the way that DC assumes that since the Dark Knight trilogy the only path to success is by way of the dark route, without actually taking the time to do it right. Joker does it right. And with an R rating it's not for kids."
The Rise of the Clown Prince,"The hype is real ladies and gentlemen, this is easily one of the finest films I have ever watched. This isn't just another CGI fueled movie with a superficial plot and big explosions trying to make up for it.
This isn't a mindless superhero, ahem, super villain movie. This is a deep and disturbing character study of what could happen to a person under highly excruciating, albeit, very realistic circumstances. To say that Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck was superb, would be an understatement. He has a way to convey his character's emotions on a level that will make you feel for him and equally disturb you. This isn't your typical ""villain-falls-in-a-tub-of-acid"" origin story, and the fact that society or lack thereof can have such an impact and break a man in such a way, makes it that much more terrifying to watch.
""Joker"" is sure to provoke some interesting talks long after leaving the theater. A must watch.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Watched this movie 3 times already before Sunday (opening weekend)...,"The viewer follows the life of the mentally ill Arthur Fleck where he struggles to stay sane in a society that has collectively cast him out.
The intricacy of Arthur's progressing insanity is one that will be remembered for years to come. The film is raw and remarkably truthful about the difficulties the mentally ill face in society. Arthur struggles to overcome his ""negative thoughts"" and become a successful stand-up comedian, while also discovering the truth of his mental illness and origin as well.
As the film progresses you realize that you're watching Arthur slowly lose his mind, despite his efforts to remain sane and reach for help. This is created in a heart breaking yet beautiful way, where you are left understanding Arthur and the decisions he comes to make by the finale.I loved this film and it may easily be my favorite of all time. The cinematography, the writing, the acting, and everything is damn near perfection. I am amazed on how Joaquin Phoenix was able to carry the film on his own and deliver such an incredible performance. Arthur is the epitome of character development in this film and I don't think that alone does this movie justice.
By the end of the film I was left with my jaw wide open; I just couldn't believe how the intricacy on Arthur's inner battles led so smoothly into the creation of the Joker. Everything in this film is original and I encourage everyone to go watch it. You might want to keep the kids at home for this one though.
If I could give it higher than a 10 I would."
"I'm no critic, but...","Joaquin is unbelievably amazing. It links the DC Universe together so well. Joker is the reason Batman is alive!
It's hard not to compare it to The Dark Knight but you have to realise this is a kind of coming of age story.
Nothing will compare to Heath Ledger. But Joaquin did a good job of linking the two.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Go watch the Movie for an Unbridled Performance from Phoenix. And for the Filmmakers who had the Determination with go through with a Disturbingly Brilliant Ventures.,"Never Did I thought there would be a redefining role for this character after Ledger. Phoenix puts his heart and soul into the psyche of a man who has little to lose, who's constantly at odds with what the society considers Norm.He tries to life by its rules, only to constantly find his back to the wall. Abused, Put down, Shaken up, Underappreciated.
It is only when he sheds his tattered concepts of morality, does the world start making sense to him. and his ascension spells chaos to the world.Joaquin Phoenix is notorious telling us stories not only through dialogue but also his Body language. And here we see, how as the strings holding him tied are cut one after the other, the timid, unsure and pitiable Arthur transforms into this confident reality he built for himself. Into what he sees as his destiny.There is no doubt that the movie is a vehicle for the character study of Arthur Fleck's descent into Madness. or as he sees it, his 'enlightenment'. the world, the characters, the narrative, even the colors and environment are set in a way to accentuate it.Make no mistake, This is not a Marvel brand of 'family Friendly' entertainment. Definitely not one you take the kids to. The actions and themes explored are chilling in how close they are to reality. They are scenes you cannot/should not be seeing, but will regardless. And it does an excellent job of making you squirm in your seats. As it should.The story towards the end overstays its welcome a bit. Without spoiling much, there were some parts where i thought 'this is when & how the story should wrap' but it kept pulling on. And at least one scene related to Bruce's origin seemed more like shoehorn. All in all, go and watch for Phoenix's Spellbinding performance and story with a heart of Dark Depravity."

Smile and put on a happy face,"There is no reason why Phoenix's elaborately backstoried Joker shouldn't be as powerful as Heath Ledger's mysterious, motiveless, originless Joker in The Dark Knight. But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn't weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn't forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.Final rate : Masterpiece.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A True Masterpiece,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, in this jaw-dropping masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It proves to be more than just a comic book villains backstory. 'Joker' meticulously captures the gradual decline of one man's mental health, and shines light on the subject of mental health in general. There are points where you begin to sympathize with the madman. Despite some of the terrible acts he happily commits, you find yourself rooting for him which leads you to question your own morality. The world has viciously beaten this man down, and this is only the beginning of his retaliation.This is, without a doubt, Phoenix's best performance so far. He carries the entire movie flawlessly, and leaves you with a lot to talk about afterwards. The brilliant method actor ensures that people will feel this characters pain, and does not disappoint for one second. Robert De Diro, another brilliant method actor, gives a fine performance as Aurthor Fleck's favorite comedy talk show host, Murray Franklin. Though he's only in the movie for roughly 10-15 minutes total, he does a very well job at depicting a phony, belligerent, television personality. Brett Cullen also gives a fine performance as the billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, and has a part in Jokers madness.The word 'masterpiece' should never be thrown around lightly. It's a term we use to describe an outstanding, almost perfect, piece of art. There are only so many films that can be considered 'masterpieces'. Rarely do we ever see a flawless movie, especially this day in age. With that being said, it is hard to NOT consider 'Joker' a masterpiece. Every scene is just as important as the next, every actor delivers a wonderful performance, and Todd Phillips does an outstanding job directing the villains transformation. 'Joker' absolutely deserves a 10/10, and nothing short of that. This movie holds a mirror up to society; it should make you question what part society takes in one's slow drift into madness. This is very relevant to today, and is a perfect example of why something like this needs to be addressed and taken seriously. Everyone needs to see this movie. Again, it will be talked about for many years to come, and could very well be considered one of the greatest drama/thrillers of all time."
Breathtaking,"I am floored, humbled, awestruck and amazed.
This movie is in one word....brilliant.
Just see it, your life will be changed.

To call this a 'Psychological Thriller' is an insult,"To claim that this film is anything other than a masterpiece is a claim that is tainted by a contradictory outlook on how mental illness should be portrayed/addressed by the media.You will ALWAYS have people who dislike films like this; to make a film this potent and powerful is to make a film that is going to be extremely controversial, and I'm sure that is exactly what the writers and directors foresaw in the making of this film.That being said, you can FEEL their vision with every single frame of this absolute masterpiece, and Phoenix not only gives the best performance of his life, but also takes the character of the Joker to a place we have never seen him before, and he takes society with him.The question of Phoenix vs Ledger will be no doubt raging within the coming months and years after this film's release. The fact is that the question is void because of the fact that they portray COMPLETELY different aspects of the Joker's persona, and both portray is masterfully. However, Phoenix's portrayal goes much deeper than Ledger's at least on an emotional level, which is all I shall say in that regard.The visceral assault of emotions I experienced during this film was unlike anything I've ever felt or experienced in my life. To portray such a traditionally psychotic character in such an emotional, and even sympathetic way, depending on your outlook, is an unbelievable feat.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and of course that is okay; people and critics are going to dislike this film, that is their opinion. But to deny that this film is anything other than a masterpiece would sadly be false, and I absolutely applaud everyone involved in this absolute work of art."

We Thought We Knew Everything About The Joker. We Were Simply Wrong,"We just had to wait for Joaquin Phoenix to prove how arrogant we were. His performance is a delightful gift, which adds a new angle to the story of one of the best comic book villains ever created.
There will still be people disappointed just because they were waiting for another superheroes' movie, full of action and CGI. It's not about that. You don't need it here. Not with a good script, accurately directed, with a brilliant performance. Altogether makes us think about this villain in different ways, enjoying this retro style journey to the heart and brain of Joker. And I definitely think now we know much more about him.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"A Perfect Origin Story - ""Do you know how I became Joker""","For long we wanted to see a origin story of Joker and here it is. Struggling comedian to Joker. Heath Ledger's joker deals on his vague origin story - ""Do you know how I got these scars"". Here is a origin story on - ""Do you know how I became Joker""
No high level vfx/cgi action scenes, almost no comedy - but this movie would keep you engaged for 2 hours. It will take a day to process the movie.This movie deserves few oscars, if suicide squad can get why not Joker6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Amazing.,"First time writing here. Just watched the film in Korea.
Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting in years of cinema. And the storyline is super. Not a corny superhero film but rather a depiction of a psychological, social birth of a supervillain. Thumbs up. Will definitely recommend for yeara to come.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A different but equally brilliant portrayal,"If Ledger showed us the deranged, criminal mastermind that is the joker than Joaquin told us how he got there. The journey is darker and more disturbing and the result is a movie that is so good, so epic, so raw that you walk out thinking, I can't watch that again.
In that way it really is like Taxi Driver, and realistically with what the film is trying to portray I can't help but feel that's a respectful response.
A lot of really satisfying nods to numerous Joker portrayals, in writing, screenplay, soundtrack and in the nuances of Joaquins portrayal. But the Dark Knight nods are the ones that really get the excitement up whilst avoiding any cheesy CGI and glad to see no sequal or spinoff platform was built in to the story.Truly a masterpiece.... that maybe you should only see once....8 out of 19 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Read carefully.,"I can see how a privileged normie will see this and think ""oh no, this will inspire the lower, unprivileged class to be violent towards us"" but if you have a few brain cells to scrape together, as well as some empathy you can totally understand what this was about - and it ain't that.A sweet, though mentally struggling, mentally abused man trying to be a light in the darkness of society is only getting punished for it until he's unwillingly pushed into things he would never possibly want to do, such as cause harm.An invisible man becomes visible. There's plenty of us who are invisible, and plenty of you who have your brainless followers and think you're the center of the universe. Even if you're not that famous you're still arrogant enough to consider yourself special because you're in Hollywood. How could you possibly understand this movie?This movie was perfectly timed in an age where mainstream media and Hollywood celebrities who smell their own far7s all day and virtue signal on Twitter while knowing nothing about life outside of a mansion - daily demonize what they view as lower class, and inexplicably, men in general. Especially emotionally fragile men like Joker.
So I see why some of the same mainstream media grasped for straws in order to twist this masterpiece into one of their little ""controversies"" in order to deter the same people they hate from watching a movie, finally, one movie, they could possibly relate to - because the struggle to survive and be kind while being deemed a low class freak is portrayed scary realistic."
Amazing Movie. Brilliant!,"Once you leave the theatre, you will absolutely feel it was yi=our money's worth. This cannot be said to be just a movie. It has elements to it that can be seen in our society even today. How a person with mental illness is laughed by the society even if there is nothing he can do about it, and also about the divide between the poor and the rich. The directing was simply brilliant and captured the darkness of the mind of the joker, The stroy even if it may be at slow at first will get better as the movie goes on. The story is dark but at the same time has scenes with comedy in it. It also has shocking bits to it which makes it an absolutely brilliant movie. The Acting was also amazing. The movie absolutely lived up to its hype. Watch it if you can!7 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
GOLD.,Masterpiece.That's it.
MASTERPIECE,"Joker is a story of what happens to a man who is beaten and given up by society and sometimes society creates monsters. I know this is a deeply character-driven story about the Joker and I believe in my heart Todd Phillips did very well. The Joker doesn't have a definite origin story but this was well executed. The score is fantastic, it's shot beautifully and Mr Phoenix gives a memorable performance for all time.

outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen .,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society.

Best Movie of the year,"They say the Phoenix rises from its own ashes--Joaquin does just that --what a flight he takes!! He evokes pathos in the most terrifying way! It is a spellbinding performance that will remain etched in gold in movie history. The joker laugh, his walk, his dance, his antics, & then his eyes--all make you wonder why an incredible actor like him keeps such low profile. He lets his work speaks & how!! ""
Don't compare this with Heath ledger-he played the Joker"";Joaquin is Arthur Fleck and his subsequent metamorphosis into the Joker! Both supremely captivating acts!
For those self appointed critics who call it depressing & condemn the violence--there is more happening in real world countries. There is nothing in this movie that has not been already shown on the big screen before-calling it disturbing and encouraging crime is such a biased take or are you so weak that a movie like this makes you take up crime??3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Worth every one of those 10 stars,"I found the Joker trailer pretty compelling but then when I came across the dozens and dozens of 1 star reviews here opposing all the dozens and dozens of 10 star reviews I sat there wondering how the hell could a film divide so many people so massively? There were so many that I couldn't ignore it, I started watching the movie thinking there was a possibility I would be bitterly disappointed.In the end I was delighted to discover it is indeed a masterpiece, a fantastic piece of cinematic history, one of the most enjoyable movies I have watched in a long time. The acting is just superb, the story excellent, the musical score was quite haunting and the directing was exquisite - quite simply 10 out of 10.How could so many people not enjoy it? The only explanation I can come up with it that perhaps they went to the cinema expecting a Batman movie, or hoping that it would be a CGI-packed action movie like the typical DC comic movie. If that's what you were expecting then I can understand the disappointment but to give it just 1 star because you felt stupid or foolish is really unfair.This is an incredibly compelling origin story with some sensational acting that deserves every Oscar it wins (which I am sure it will) but to those of you expecting a standard Batman or Ironman flick or if you're hoping for Wonder Woman to jump out from behind a car then you will be disappointed. It is a fantastic movie."
Film Review: Joker,"Having watched this last night, I am in a trance. This film was absolutely brilliant, but it is not for the faint hearted. Joaquin Phoenix does the best Joker we've seen since The Dark Knight and he must receive Best Actor for this. This film is not so gory it should be an 18, but it is particularly gory. In one scene, a man is stabbed with scissors and his head is bashed against a wall. The aftermath is disgusting. Strong language occurs throughout the film. Beware, this is NOT a superhero movie. This film is about mental health and it is not in any way about the DC universe. Even my dad liked it, and that's saying something.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Phenomenal!,"I loved every minuet of Joker. I was extremely happy when I found out that we would be solely looking into the Jokers character and identifying what makes him tick and what causes his characteristics. Now before i go into what I loved about the cinematography, i need to say Joaquin Phoenix played the character exceptionally. His laughter to his delivery to his weight loss, Joaquin really made the character convincing and mesmerized me. It's amazing how we feel sympathy for someone who killed people and see the antagonistic as the protagonist in a way. Furthermore, Joaquin got the Joker's laugh on point. Not only is the laugh pretty psychotic, but we wince at the pain he goes through when he start to cough uncontrollably.Moving onto the cinematography Lawrence Sher did a amazing job with his colour correction, his composition to his use of semiotic theory. The use of the grungy dark green and dimmed black really conveys the tone of the film. Especially in the bathroom scenes and the subway shots. However, the composition was the aspect that really blew me away. Lawrence really used his surroundings to not only get rid of negative space and make the film look beautiful, but he is fantastic a making the viewers eyes look at a certain part of the screen.I could go on and on about this film, however, being a young film student I don't feel like I am in a position where i can criticize this films cinematography or direction. However, if i would have to give one improvement it would be certain tweaks to parts of the script. Mainly when it comes to his family relationship. I would of loved to have seen more of that.A amazing film and a must watch!"
Brilliant,"I was hesitant to watch this film as the reviews I read weren't good. It was described as ""artsy"" and ""slow"". My guess now is that those reviews were written by toddlers. This film is nothing like the typical Batman movies however it still has great action scenes. In my opinion, this film is far better than the typical superhero/villain movies. How it subtly focuses on mental health issues is just wonderful. People like myself can relate in a deeper way than the average movie goer. As for the acting...wow, blown away. Joaquin has shown many times hes a great actor but his talent in this film is unmatched. It pushed him to the very top of my favorites list. If you love a good story, great characters, intense action and a film that makes you think, you will not be disappointed!3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Joker - Movie Review,"I knew that I loved Joker when I first saw it, but I have now seen it three times and it just keeps getting better with every rewatch. Obviously, the shining achievement of this film is Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. There isn't really much I can say about his performance that hasn't already been said, but I would be completely shocked and a little upset if he doesn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.Phoenix perfectly embodied the role of a man who was beaten down and broken by the society that he was being forced to live in, and we as an audience were able to completely understand where he was coming from. That doesn't mean that we approve of his actions, but all of the best villains are the people with a backstory that we can understand, and this absolutely happened in Joker.The supporting actors all played their parts as well, and there wasn't a single weak link to the film. I am shocked that Todd Phillips went from directing films like The Hangover and Due Date, to Joker. I never knew he has this level of talent within him, but now I am genuinely excited to see where he will go from here. Having rewatched Joker a few times now, Philips scatters breadcrumbs throughout the film that I was able to pick up when revisiting it, and he also pays attention to loads of insignificant details which I loved.The score was also phenomenal, and added to the tone of the picture. I also really liked the cinematography, because every frame had care put into it and was able showcase exactly what Phillips was going for. I loved everything about Joker, and consider it to definitely be one of the best comic book movies ever made, even if it doesn't go about it in the traditional sense.Plain and simple, Joker is a masterpiece, and it just gets better the more I watch it.SCORE: 100%"

Send in the clown...,"Last night I finally got to watch this film. 'The Joker' is thrilling from beginning to end. This take on the very iconic character was just so intriguing. Arthur is such a fully realized character. His story is both a tragedy and a comedy. The movie follows this character from the misunderstood tragic clown to his descent into madness. And Joaquin Phoenix captures all of this really well with his Oscar-worthy performance. He's one hell of an actor. This movie works so well because of him.Yes, there are a lot of similarities and homages to several films like ' Taxi Driver' but I think Todd Phillips and everyone did such an amazing job making this movie so it stands on its own. The score by composer Hildur Guonadottir was terrific as well.I think a lot of people can relate to a character like Arthur. He's the forgotten man. The weirdo. Cast aside by society. No one gave a crap about him and it's a real shame. The system failed him and many others. Mental illness is such a big problem in society and I feel we all need to be better at understanding and being supportive. You never truly know what's going on in someone's mind. We as a society create monsters. A person can only take so much until they just snap. And Arthur definitely snapped. His message may not be entirely wrong and we can all agree with him on some points, but his actions certainly were wrong. Send in the clown..."

Wonderful and sad,"Joker is hard to watch at times. I actually cringed a few times. It is so well acted by Phoenix. The setting is dark dingy and feels sick like the character.

His lonesomeness, metal instability and the lack of compassion that people showed to him all make it understandable. Although he is a violent maniac in the end- I was almost glad to see he had found his purpose and was finally liked.

Damn good movie,"I expected little with it being attached to DC.
I was wrong and wrong again. This the best 'origin story' movie I've ever seen. The movie did a good job of following his descent into madness and gave him sympathy.

"Very dark, violent and beautiful...","I don't think enough critics understand the concept and the style of this movie because they thought the movie was too dark and too violent, If you see the reviews for this movie, don't listen to them, watch it! Because ""Joker"" is one of the best comic book films I've seen in 2019 since ""Endgame"".
Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as the Joker, everytime you hear him laugh, you know you're in for a great time, Robert De Niro is also in this movie and that's exciting to hear about. The cinematography, the score, the acting, the atmosphere of Gotham, everything about this movie is amazing.
I did heard some people talk about of how the movie's similar to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"", and yes I could see that, and to me it makes me want to watch ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time, I never seen ""The King of Comedy"" though, but I might later.
Although, what people are most talking about is the level of violence in this movie, and yes I know it could very controversial to hear about and it could inspire a person to do it, and it happened before, but come on guys, It's JUST a movie, everything about the violence is set-up behind the production.
Overall, ""Joker"" is an amazing film with beautiful cinematography, amazing score and an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, This is easily one of the best comic book films I've ever seen.Score: 10/10 ---- Highly Recommended"

"Top contender for 9th Feb, 2020","So Joker is now at #26 in the list of top rated movies of all time in IMDb at the time of writing this. After watching the movie I critically examined the top 25 movies that are ahead of Joker right now, and concluded a few can actually go ahead of this - a very few. And movies like The Dark Knight, The Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club and a few others may not be eligible for sitting ahead of Joker.All in all, Joker now onwards should be synonym of Joaquin Phoenix. With due respect, the age is Heath Ledger is gone. Joaquin cries, laughs, bleeds, runs, sweats, sings, dances and kills. Gives everything to create a towering character in the history of cinema, and in the history of movie acting. In each frame you can feel the pain of the deprived and dispossessed man. In each frame you can witness how a simple and chaste man can be transformed into a villain by the torments of the society when all of his tries go in vain.And finally we must congratulate Todd Phillips for this masterpiece and thank him for creating an eternal character here.92nd Academy Awards:Best actor: Joaquin Phoenix

What doesn't love you simply makes you ...stranger!!!,"Hello there ...Todd Phillip's Joker is here to hit you with a smile stronger than a thousand fists,A realistic depiction of an iconic Cartoon character , strongly influenced by masterpieces of the past , If you were amazed by movies such as Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and King of Comedy , then you are in for a treat , but does it stop there?Absolutely not, Phillips managed to combine landmark storylines from the myths cartoon artists gave us, such as Alan Moore's The Killing Joke with classic cinema masterpieces in modern society while he takes us in a deep dive of society's everyday problems and psychology, he dresses his movie with an outstanding soundtrack by talented young composer Hildur Guðnadóttir (she also gave us the score to drama miniseries Chernobyl ),and a colorful cinematography, creating something new and sadistically beautiful because you can't help yourself but to fall in love with the main character although you know he is the bad guy ... or is he not?It's already a classic, and I dare to say a landmark because I believe is going to be a great influence for future movies,of course Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal stands as one of the greats in cinema history , is Joker sane or crazy , is he a product of society or his twisted imagination, a criminal mastermind or a straw dog? maybe he is all of the above ... this movie will leave you with mixed feelings and a lots of thoughts ... it gets deep in you and makes you think what makes us human ... is it a smile always true , is it happiness ? and yet no matter how hurt you are there is always a rainbow after the storm ..."

I just get the joke.,Joker is a movie in a guy's head. He makes us pity him and that was the joke. (I just get the joke)
Rated R for realistic,"I remember watching batman in the 90s, even the cartoon was darker and more emotionally compelling then the most modern superhero movie franchises. The back stories of the villains painted a picture into their behavior. Most were tormented in some way or had some twisted take on justice. In some ways they were initially right. Batman wouldn't just try to stop them, he'd try to help them.As for the movie itself, as others have said haunting and compelling. It takes the simple concept we've seen to have forgotten above and blasted us with reality. Their are sad and broken people all around us.If this was a true story he probably would have just ended up as a homeless beggar. Instead we get a fairy tale villain. So you don't have to keep feeling sorry for him. But the movie does a good enough job to keep that in the back of your mind whether you realize it or not.If they could achieve this level with Clay Face, Gator Guy etc that would be epic. Enjoy!"
Joachin Phoenix is worth every penny,"I've watched most of Joachin Phoenix films, most have been wierd and underwhelming, Even though underneath it all he's obviously a very talented actor. I've always felt he's just picked not so great films to act in with not so great story lines or dialogue. Joachin Phoenix shines throughout this movie and truly shows what a very talented actor he is. I actually cant imagine anyone else to have played Joker,too even remotely as well as Joachin Phoenix.This film is triumphant and although I did go in expecting it to be a decent film, as it had pretty good reviews. I was gripped right from the beginning to the end with some edge of the seat scenes and it was a lot better than I was expecting to be honest. The storyline his character were good also, but it would not have worked so well with anyone else playing Joker. The very sad part of this film,like being let down by society is actually true as I've seen it first hand. I'm not talking about the USA, but the United Kingdom and it's getting worse as were sadly turning into an I'm alright jack society. Where mostly people just think about themselves which makes this film even more real to me. Anyway I'm rambling ,I actually agree that this film is a masterpiece and I'm not a fan usually of DC films. I think this film will be Joachin Phoenix's greatest success story as I cant see him topping this purely raw but superb movie. It would be nice now to see another Batman movie vs the Joker maybe Christian Bale as Batman and of course Joachin as Joker. I think that would be another film worth watching. Go watch it and enjoy an acting performance of a lifetime."

He embodies mental disease in a terrifying performance, which gives rise to the worst and best villain, while imagined, this world has ever created. His take on The Joker is fearful for its honesty and realism, and how believable that such a reality could create a monster in today's world. Hats off.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
The Broken Clown Prince,"When I first saw the 'Joker' in ""The Dark Knight"" I fell in love with the character, because of his somewhat correct motives and the way he thinks. I had never seen a character like him before in any movie, which made it so new and refreshing to watch. When the ""Joker"" movie was announced I was stunned. Especially when I noticed Joaquin Phoenix was going to take on the role of the Joker. An actor that in my opinion is one of the greatest - if not the best - performers of the 20th century. Sr. Phoenix is so good at taking on roles that most people wouldn't want to take on because of how horrifying, haunting or psychologically difficult they are. As someone who absolutely loved Heath Ledger (may he rest in peace) as the Joker, I was extremely curious about Joaquin's performance when I was waiting in the theater for the movie the start. I was not disappointed, not at all. Sr. Phoenix performed beyond my expectations. To me it felt like Joaquin actually transformed 'himself' into the character which gave the personage a very realistic and terrifying touch. The story allowed this character to feel even more real, by placing him in a world that could - if not already - be real and making him face obstacles that people might actually be facing daily. As if there is a deeper message and meaning behind the story. It is very difficult to describe my thoughts on this movie, but that's what so great about it. It allows you to think for yourself. At the end of the movie, every single person in the theater probably thought of a different ending or reason for certain keypoints in the film. It wasn't just a casual ""good guy bad guy"" story, not at all.I rate this movie 10/10 because to this day I do not seem to be able to sum up any negative points in this movie. I enjoyed it, I will enjoy it many more times and I highly recommend you to give it a shot as well if you haven't yet - because it might just change your whole perspective on cinematography."

An absolute Masterpiece and truly haunting performance from Joaquin Phoenix,"Wow, that was an experience of a film. It's rare for a film to live up to its hype, even rarer for it to surpass it and my God didn't this movie just do that. The grit and feel of the film is something that is a wonder to watch with tremendous storytelling and what is a truly astounding performance from Phoenix. His portrayal of the Joker was quite rightly always going to be compared to Heath Ledgers magnificent portrayal and I, along with many many others, suspected it could not be done again. How wrong I was, Joaquin is truly unbelievable in this film, you can actually believe he has completely gone insane, just broken from the crooked system we live in. It is so strange how relatable the character is as anyone who has fell on hard times probably has gone through struggles that no one deserves and highlights so many problems in our modern day society. This is honestly one of the best films ever and is something really special, just sit back and enjoy.......and smile3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar,"I am not a fan of Batman movies (though I have watched them all) and I really hated the Dark Knight movie. And the reason I hated it was the reason everyone loved it. It was Heath Ledger. His acting was the epitomy of abnoxious. It was sooo annoying to watch him. But then he died and everyone praised his acting even more.
I am not a fan of Joker either. When I saw this movie's trailer I was like Oh my here we go again. Another annoying movie.
I was not supposed to watch it. But after all the success and the reviews I decided to watch it, not in order to enjoy it but in order to see what everyone was talking about and have my own opinion.
I was shocked because instead of watching a mehh movie I watched a masterpiece.
I really do not understand why many governments banned this movie for people under 18 (it is not scary or gory) and I do not understand why people expected mass shootings or things like that.
This is JUST A MOVIE. Not scarier than other movies I have watched. It is a movie about people with mental illnesses and about people who are neglected by their country and authorities.
But what makes this movie really worth watching is Joaquin Phoenix. I like him as an actor but I never thought he was THAT good. He is excellent."
One of the greatest performances of all time.,"A beautifully dark, and sometimes hard to watch film. You could even forgot you were actually watching Joaquin Phoenix, and that's a good thing, because you just felt and saw Arthur Fleck in the movie. Zazie Beets and Robert were mind blowing too.

The type of movie that changes society,"Phenomenal. best movie I've seen in a long time. Never thought anyone would be able to play joker better than heath ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. It's not a comic book story per say but an actual story of a man who's on the cusp of insanity and society just pushes him over the edge. It just seemed real, like i could fully imagine someone going through this very thing. I walked out and thought that a movie like that could start a revolution in real life. I could see people buying into and if i recall, some of the people protesting in Hong Kong were dressing up as joker as part of the protest. Not to overstate it, but I don't know that a movie has ever really touched me like that before.

The film can not be liked, does not cause a desire to revise it, but you admire it. Despite all the tragedy, all the pain that is contained in each frame, the film really admires. Although most of the reviews, both critics and viewers, are positive, there are fierce disputes about the film: someone does not like it decisively, someone sees in the film only the Joker, the villain opposing Batman. For me, this film is primarily about people, about the need to always treat everyone humanely. ""No one owes anyone anything,"" I don't dispute that phrase, but even without doing anything good to a person, you can be kind to them the second your lives cross.""The Joker"" is a one-man story, as frightening as it is realistic.

"A dark twist of a movie made for Joaquin Phoenix, one of the greatest actors alive today","If ever there was a role made for a master actor, one who can wring out the lurking, soulful depths of depravity and insanity, with such intensity it is spellbinding, it is Joaquin Phoenix. From Commodus to Johnny Cash to the guy who falls in love with Her to the incredibly overlooked role he played in Master, the range of this best there is professional is beyond description. His every move, every sound, every painful looking move of the emaciated body he lost 55 plus pounds to play grinds with the grit and scum of the streets of crushing New York. His descent into insanity is a work of art. His laughter was so intense and so biting it will cause nightmares. Others have played tormented minds with great success. Violent, yes. So is the endless bottom of the pit shoveled over to the bottom of the heap of society, one of which he plays to perfection. It's a dark movie. Going insane is dark. And you will witness it line by line and be mesmerized by what you see Phoenix doing in every scene. There is hardly any room in this film for any of the other good actors.

Simply masterful.,"I'm seriously not a fan of the whole Marvel explosion of films that ,no matter how you view them , ends up being the same picture. This Warner Brother's film ,of the DC comic's top villain Joker, is nothing like any of those films. It's dark, depressing, bleak and extremely slow. Instead of letting the special fx's, fight scenes and testosterone filled action take center stage, it allows space for a mesmerizing acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Many are saying that he copied Deniro's performance in Taxi Driver, but I say that he honestly topped that performance by a mile. Deniro had no boundaries. Phoenix had to craft his performance within the boundaries of the comic book super villain named Joker, and he masterfully makes the transformation right in front of our eyes, within 120 minutes.The plot has been criticized for being heavy handed, but honestly the simple fact that we can have such a story still be relevant in 2019, shows that as a society we haven't been heavy handed enough. There are no happy endings in Joker. Some might say that it even glorifies or at least justifies the evils of the world. Maybe it does. But remember , the story ,like Phoenix's performance is bound by the DC story in the first place. If you have a problem with the bleakness , it might be because you are coming to the realization that at some point we will be Gotham because we are definitely following on the path of Gotham's past that this film represents.Overall, I don't know of a better Comic book film. As a matter of fact , it's the only comic book film of recent years that is Oscar worthy."

A beautiful dark and hard to watch MASTERPEICE 🖤,"I'm literally impressed and extremely happy
Joker will be the beginning of a revolution in the world of cinema and comic book movies ( i hope ).
This movie is brilliant, thrilling, sad and a beautiful dark masterpiece.
A spectacular character study with an unbelivebale and outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, this is by far the best performance in last
10 years, the way he laughs, his body language, his eyes, his facial expressions are all out of this world, Joaquin conveys all types of emotions in a sensational way.
The story is well paced and takes us step by step with arther and his fall from sanity to insanity each action and each detail matters and affects the coming events and makes us as audience understand to some degree the horrible actions that arther will do in the future.
This movie accuses us the society and puts the blame on us for the way we treat ourselves and how we create within us monsters.
The Joker that we get in the end is a moving representation of the corruption in our society and especially our media wich explains why there is a group of ""critcs"" that are demonizing
The movie and ignoring the art in it and the big message it carries.
Todd Philips you surprised me this is big jump in your career from comedy to such a perfected drama the shots, the close ups, the cinematography, the tone of the movie everything is really masterful and of course how can i forget Hildur guonadottir and her mesmerizing score that fits perfectly each scene and each transformations arther goes through, her soundtrack plays with our emotions and our nerves and makes us feel the darkness of this movie.
This Film is nearly perfect, hard to watch, tough and makes you think about a lot of things. The only thing that may be bugging for some is the heavy inspiration from Scorsese's movies especially taxi driver and the king of comedy, i don't consider this a bad thing each filmmaker must be ispired from other works but it's a little but obvious here even so it's not a problem for me and because of all the other good things that impressed me and touched my soul and the questions that this work of art made me ask i give it a 10/10."

Amazing from start to finish,"As someone who's loved Batman (and the Joker, respectively) since I was a child, I think I was going to enjoy the film regardless of how it turned out.

Joaquin Phoenix played the role perfectly, and the character and story was beautifully created by Todd Phillips. Some of the dialogue wasn't very memorable, but then I realised that not every line has to be. After all, this film was meant to be what could possibly happen in a real scenario, and not everything said in real life is poetic or memorable. So that being said, I really have no faults with this movie. It was everything I wanted and more.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Engaging from start to finish,"This film was engaging from the very first moment to the very last. That is not to say every moment was a blockbuster high action event, but the acting, pacing, and staging of every scene was so dynamic and carefully crafted that one feels engaged at all times, regardless of energy level. Joaquin Pheonix is truly a master of acting, and his ability to completely transform into Arthur is astounding. The piece that truly sells his role as Joker are his eyes: he truly has a madness in his eyes and they pierce through the screen. This film does not seem to fit into any one genre (horror, action/adventure, comedy) but rather is more like a character study and artistic demonstration on the formation of Joker in Gotham City. This is a modern, self-aware, psychologically relevant perspective on a traditionally outlandish, wild, and inexplicably wild villain from DC cannon.

This magnificent movie stirred up So many emotions that will stay with us for a long time. It swept us off our feet. It was a glorious feast for the eyes!. Had us hooked from the very beginning. In so many words which still won't be enough.... It was outstanding, superb, captivating, fascinating, hypnotizing, extraordinary, exceptional, majestic, opulent, entrancing, monumental, unique.... Wow wow wow..... also a deep sense of sadness and empathy that brought us both to tears as we walked out of the cinema...

Revolution,"The movie is like a window to an emotion, to a philosophy. They showed us how to look and perceive someone's actions by looking at their interactions. Joaquin Phoenix, I wish you the best. It seems that you internalized Joker so deeply, so made us believe you're noone but him. From now on, nbody can even dare to portray another Joker.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Joaquin Phoenix is incredible.,"Just by watching this movie you can tell that Joaquin Phoenix makes every effort possible to perfect his role as the iconic Joker. He makes the viewing experience incredibly uncomfortable but in all the best ways. The viewer truely feels that Joaquin is actually psychotic and mentally deranged. Viewers will compare him to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but each Joker is beautiful in their own way; there is no comparison.10/103 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
JOKER IT'S JUST EPIC,I'm not a big fan of comics. But I am fan of everything around the pop culture that superheroes are. So I know a couple of things about Gotham and Batman.My hype for this movie was because it's proclaimed as very violent and talks about mental issues. I love characters with mental health problems so watching this was awesome. The Joker it's the first movie with a low pacing and obviously not commercial that I would say it's my favorite of all times.The third act of this movie it's golden. No spoilers but the ending left me shaking.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
Captivating,"This film draws you in from the very start and keeps hold of you right to the very end. You shouldn't feel sorry for him but you do, you just want people to be nice to him and for him to have a better life but then there wouldn't be any point to the film if that was the case. I'm not a Batman or super hero fan but you don't need to be to watch it. Whilst it obviously links to the super hero films, it's still a standalone film in its own right and a brilliant psychological crime drama. Never before have I seen a film that I'm still thinking about a week later.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joaquin blew our mind, the audience was enjoying as if it were live screening. If his Majesty Mr. Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar, I can say and please allow me to quote Roberto Benigni from ""La tigre e la neve"" - they can close this whole show of a world... they can cart it off, unscrew the stars, roll up the sky and put it on a truck, they can turn off this sunlight.....

"normally when I come to the cinema to watch DC movies, DC usually let me down recently.","It is weird, normally when I come to the cinema to watch DC movies, DC usually let me down recently. But Joker 2019 is different. Bear in mind, Im no movie critic or something, Im just trying to justify my review as a fan who finally get the movie he want.
Normally, for a villain character, movie makers fail to justify his ""evilness"". Because they tend to isolate the character with the world around them, thus general movies create theme of ""edginess"" that me and others despite the most. But Joker is not a character, if somebody ask me to describe who, what, how is Joker, it is extremely difficult for me to explain who he Joker. Joker is more like a presentation of the society around him (Gotham City). There is no ""right right"" in this kind of scenario. Any characters in the movie are flawed in their own way. Many of them like Thomas Wayne of ""the rich"" are evil in many standard, but they convince themselves and the society around them that they are ""all good"". But Athur (Joker) fight back that kind of attitude, he tried to seek help but all the help he receive just pushed him further into madness. In the end, he is nobody, Arthur gave up his identity the society gave him to be reborn as Joker.
I have to say, watching Joker is very uneasy experience, it is very disturbing to be honest. So watch with ur own regard. But this is what art is, to push border, to go above and beyond normal standard. This film is definately special."
An epitome of Excellence,"To the people, who say Joaquin Phoneix deserves an Oscar for his performance, please pardon me, but I beg to differ. This guy does not deserve an Oscar, Oscar should beg in front of him and say ""Please accept me!"". He is a walking university of acting. Every scene, every private moment, every emotion, its beyond human perfection! This kind of cinema is a rare commodity. I could give million stars to how everything in this movie was picture perfect (from direction to music to acting to cinematography to screenplay). Please watch it in theaters.

Best movie I've seen in a long time! Absolute Masterpiece!!,"I would like to start off by saying that Joaquin Phoenix is a goddamn genius! His acting is out of this world and it truly brings together this beautiful movie. I seriously cannot think of one thing I didn't like about the movie and honestly I don't understand how people can possibly dislike it. First off, for people saying it's slow and boring, it's not meant to be a typical action packed superhero movie. If you went into the movie thinking that's what you were getting with this movie then you need to take a film education class. And if you don't see the amount of finesse and time was put into the movie then I don't know what to tell you. All in all, thank you Joaquin and Todd for creating such a beautiful historic movie! If this movie doesn't win at least 1 or 2 oscars on top of Joaquin alone then we will riot with clown masks.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Not an action movie, but a psychological thriller.","I see a lot more great reviews for this now but when it first came I saw a lot of hate. I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick!"
Truly a masterpiece!,"This movie isn't for all viewers who subscribe to mature audience material, especially viewers with acute depression and other mental disorders. Yet those who courageously go through the motions will find a high level of appreciation for the extreme psychologically graphic material delivered masterfully by an actor whose whole career is outshone by his performance in this movie alone.This being said, the iconic supervillain is finally seen coming to terms with his downhill path to unlock his true nature that defines the true nature of the Clown Prince of Crime, and the sordid story of his relationship to his mother.Much also provided with DeNiro's up top performance that greatly magnifies the intensity of one of the most shockingly memorable movie climax moment seen in years.Joaquin Phoenix outdid himself all around and outdid the hype masterfully."

I'll never listen to Frank Sinatra the same way again...,"Joker is an outstanding character study. One of 2019's biggest surprises, pushing the boundaries of what you're comfortable with looking at. Not once did it seem like I was watching a comic book movie. It's a chilling and artful approach to the iconic villain that doesn't hold back on exploring mental illness and the lower class in a brutally raw and honest way. Even with its occasional touches on the Batman mythos, which flowed well with the story and didn't seemed forced at all, the focus is entirely on Arthur Fleck's turmoil and transformation into the Joker and Joaquin Phoenix delivers a richly disturbing performance to support that. The psychological twists to some story cliches were unexpected and refreshing, too. Amazing film. Not for the faint of heart.

All I have are positive reviews,"Just got back from seeing it 4 hours ago and it was as great as I thought it was gonna be, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic (everyone else is great too but Joaquin commands the entire thing), the score and soundtrack were fantastic, the opening credits fit perfectly with the theme, and even the cinematography is great (this was a grimier, dirtier, and uglier Gotham City than what we're used to). it can easily pass as a scorsese flick since his fingerprints were left after leaving the producer's chair. I'm torn between which joker I like best between ledger and Phoenix, but I know that heath ledger would be very proud of Joaquin for pulling it off, give him ALL the oscars I say, he's earned them. but anyway, I recommend this to scorsese fans and joker fans alike. I definitely wanna see it again, maybe even buy the blu-ray. on a side note, for it being a slow burn, it's actually a slow burn done right like The Godfather3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Fantastically produced art,"The uniqueness of this movie can't be underlined enough.

Beautiful and brilliant.,"Having watched Hollywood decline alongside with the latest trend of the dumbing down of nations (as I call this phase we are in), has made going to the cinema more of an empty distraction than a meaningful experience for the past number of years. Thus, when I sat down to watch this movie my expectations were low, as usual. It turned out that this movie was one of the best movies I have ever watched on screen.There is never going to be a Joker movie that can surpass this one - this was pure art scripted and performed by real talent. Joaquim Phoenix is also a real actor, unlike your usual dumb as hell, painfully overrated cadre of overpaid Hollywood pretty boys - who can't act.10.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Brilliant, Raw and intriguing take on The Joker.","The movie is dark, it's gritty and intense at times. Its a movie that gets the discussion going on so many questions that we ask within society today.

Joaquin was perfection, DONT go into this thinking it's going to be the in the same realm as Heath Ledgers Joker it's so different. Almost like two different genres.Overall this is the best movie I've seen 2019, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.

Better than expected,"I had mixed feelings after watching the trailer. I said to myself that this won't be a good movie, no effects, no fast-paced action, no Batman, no classical Joker.Actually you don't need any of these in order to make a great movie. Joker is brutally realistic and atmospheric. It makes you feel thorned, in some moments you like and emphatise the main character, in others you hate him. We witness the development of a character and the birth of the Joker in a very realistic way. We miss such movies nowadays with good story telling, great atmosphere and almost to no CGI.

Artistically, the construction of the scenes was immaculate, with the television reflecting the protagonist's psychological state and the recurring motifs of laughter and media used in the brightest of ways. The political commentary was not only well constructed but also incredibly relevant in our times.

Dear DC make more movies like this. Please.,"Joker is what I call a masterpiece, the film was phenomenal, brilliant,etc. I saw the film x2 and i was the best film I have ever seen.

As for Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker, what can I say he deserves an Oscar for this performance, I can not stop praising how good he was, I felt every pain and laugh he went through, the film was just great. Ceaser Romero and Heath Ledger would be proud of this guy. Joaquin Phoenix is the guy who would put his acting skills first then the money. He was dedicated to play the Joker and he absolutely nailed it. Todd Phillips is now one of my favorite directors now, along with Matt Reeves, Steven Spielberg, and Chris Nolan.

Prodigious.,"I was pretty sure I was gonna like it but this film left me walking out the cinema speechless. The finest piece of work from Phoenix and Phillips.I have never rated or reviewed before, so this is my first one because I need to express my judgment for this movie simply because of the movie it ended up to be after anticipating since the start of production. This kind of acting and directing is exactly what I love and I consider to be my favourite being the huge film fanatic I am so I want to give all movies the right rating according to how I find them, so I would never usually give a movie a 10 because for me it has to be if not faultless but I am going to give this movie a 10 and to me here's why. I have always been a fan of Todd Phillips since his early goofy comedies to his later movies where I can tell he has set up a nice distinct directing technique and that is what I love about directors and the different styles they all have and use to put a film together, to then see what they bring to screen, but the way he has emphasised this film is truly remarkable. I didn't expect he would create and present a pure masterpiece but that is exactly what it is.
I have always loved Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker, it was extremely stupendous, One of the best acting roles we have ever seen in film history, you couldn't disagree. But what Joaquin Phoenix had innovated was so unique and astounding, it was exactly what I look for in playing a psychotic character. I was honestly blown away with his performance. I am going to be extremely disappointed and confused if these two men don't receive an Oscar for best writing/directing and an Oscar for best actor. I feel like I shouldn't even have to mention the fact that it was fairly especial and absolutely nothing like a film you would think is DC, to me it's not a superhero/villain comic book character movie. It is the best character study flick I have ever seen. I know it won't be for everyone considering the few scenes of strong voilence and language and could be disturbing to some so I understand peoples different opinions on how they find the film but I found it to be precisely a literal showpiece with extraordinary qualities.
Please see it to find out."

Dark and profound.,"I purposefully didn't read other reviews, as I wanted my opinion of this film to be my own. Did I enjoy it, possibly not. It wasn't entertaining or entertainment. What it was à dark, very dark and deeply disturbing reflection of our dysfunctional society. A society where the most vulnerable in society are marginalised and don't get the help or support they need.
This is a film about mental health and seeing it on Mental Health Awareness day provided a more powerful message than all the items on the news, in the press and on social media.
Joaquin Phoenix in the title role was beyond description in the way he bought this character to life. Chilling, frightening and yet at the same time conveying the vulnerability of a man lost in his own world, where there is no one to support him and no one who will listen to him and understand him.

You'll wonder for days to come what actually happened in this movie, and that's what makes it so worth while. Joaquin Phoenix makes you so uncomfortable in this movie with his acting, that's how good he is.Two quick warnings: Please don't take your children to this movie and please, if you have any mental illness or know someone with a mental illness, this movie will not be best idea to watch.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"The best comic book movie ever?, maybe!","Well, I really don't know where to start, as Todd Phillips has clearly stated this movie has been inspired in the Batman comic books, but IT IS NOT, based directly in any comic o graphic novel ever published,Having said that, I consider this movie a masterpiece in every possible way. Undoubtedly one of the 10 best movies of this century, and also , without a doubt , one of the 100 best movies ever made in the history of cinema. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible in his representation of the mentally ill Arthur Fleck, and as the Joker is, well, absolutely out of this world. The Oscar to best actor should not even enter the competition this year, it belongs to him. A stark portrait of the cruelty of modern society, a superb reminder that mental illness is real and affects thousands of people around the world. What more can be said? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix, and the rest of the crew and cast deserve a standing ovation. BRAVO !!!!!!!!!!3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Do not believe the mainstream paid critics!,"I'd have given it an 8 or 9. But decided on 10/10 to counter those teenagers giving unfair lowv ratings because they got ""bored"" and have no idea what they've just seen.Critics paid by recognized publishers also seem to degrade this piece of art. Hollywood politics in full flow.For those falling for inevitable comparison of Phoenix and Ledger, get this: Phoenix is the best Arthur Fleck (origin of Joker) for Ledger's the Joker. They complete each other.This isn't about the shrewd and brutal agent of chaos going about his business. This is about making of that epic character.A few things left open for interpretation (Thomas Wayne's note on the backside of an old photo being the biggest one) makes it even better.Phoenix has his name written on the Oscar."

Masterful Filmmaking!,"It's rare when we get to see a movie that's this close to perfect. Normally something or another, sometimes multiple things, are lacking in a movie. It could be one of the actors, the writing, the cinematography could be subpar, and on and on. To have a movie made like that this is so nearly flawless across the board is very special.Joaquin Phoenix plays, quite likely, his best performance to date which says a lot considering how many great roles he's already done in his life. When I first heard about this movie when it was in the works I'll admit that I thought Joaquin was miscast. Boy was I wrong and in retrospect I'm not sure why I thought that.Another thing that concerned me initially was that the director, Todd Phillips, was unproven as anything other than a comedy director (to me). Another major miss on my part there. Todd Phillips did an absolutely amazing job both directing and writing this masterpiece of a movie.Going back to what I said above, most movies suffer from scenes that are either wasteful, serving no purpose or scenes that are flawed. All of these scenes serve a purpose and succeed at it very well by adding to the movie in some way or elevating the movie in some way. Further, there were some scenes that if they weren't in the movie the movie as a whole would have been less cohesive. Todd Phillips did such an amazing job walking the fine line between having redundant scenes or scenes that barely told us enough to paint the picture of how The Joker became The Joker.Truly an amazing movie. I'd rate it between a 9.5 and a perfect 10."

Jack Nicholson's Joker is a (very) distant third.,"Let me start by saying, this is a DC universe I want to further explore.The movie does an excellent job connecting most of the main Gotham characters and the possibilities for a sequel or sequels are endless.
Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for best male lead. His performance of Arthur Fleck (i.e. Joker) is truly remarkable and with minimal dialogue, he conveys pain, disgust and an eventual decent to madness that will shock you. This is the most realistic Batman related movie.
The movie is a character and society study. On one hand, a character abused, beaten, humiliated and totally ignored and on the other hand, a society literary overrun by rats.
The story of the particular Joker is truly heartbreaking. From a boy full of happiness to the Joker. By the end of the movie, you are shocked but feel that you understand why Arthur Fleck became the Joker.

Art meets cinema,"An actor can elevate cinema, a mass entertainment medium to art which elevated the soul.The back story to how Joker became the Joker is moving, disturbing and entertaining at same time. The story moves along at its own pace and the moral justification for have nots may have its distractors but it is firmly in keeping with the Gotham universe. The descent of the Man into a place where nothing matters is convincing and the audience is moved.Violence shown is necessary and not gratuitous.

Time to start deconstructing superheroes,"Joaquin Phoenix is terrific and so is the film. Just like the era where westerns faded into dystopian anti-westerns, I hope we're going to start deconstructing superhero films. I agree with Martin Scorsese that superhero movies are closer to theme parks than actual cinema. He's nowhere near the first person to say it but he's right nonetheless. I hope we're entering an era in film where superheroes are deconstructed. That would be far more interesting than roller coasters.Regarding the film, I wouldn't have expected that a deep dive into the failings of our mental health system merging with grass-roots anti-fascist politics would be this compelling but here we are.I never really cared for Batman - he always seemed to be just a rich guy with expensive toys - so I guess I was open to the message but still, very very good movie (also very violent, don't take the kiddies)."

Joker - A Criminal or Victim,"Best movie saw till date. Joker is that movie which takes you to BTS of villains that Hollywood has never shown.

A Masterpiece,"This film transcends its genre in a way I wasn't sure possible, and it is all credited to the understanding of the titular character by both the actor playing him, and the director directing him. I am an avid Joker fan. I read the comics, own many of the iconic graphic novels that center around him, and I can honestly say this is the character fully realized. I was honestly baffled by the level of character depth revealed, not just in the acting, but also in the direction. This movie is literally Arthur Fleck, aka Joker's, point of view; and the director and lead actor take you down the rabbit hole descent into madness in the best possible way. It's both incredibly original, and yet incredibly grounded and respectful of who the Joker is, and what we the fans have come to expect. The movie is not for everyone. It is not an action packed thrill ride. It's not an ultra violent theme park ride of sadism. It is a very realistic, psychologically in-depth character study thriller. It's slow burn tension, the tension being the character's descent into madness. I found myself on edge waiting for him to snap, and yet hoping that he would not. I did not expect that at all, and I can only praise the film more because of that. It creates depths I had not expected, nor had I imagined. Yet there they were! In short, Joker sits firmly next to The Dark Knight as a masterpiece of comic book filmmaking. They're the only two films that transcend the genre, and they both center around The Joker. Coincidence? I think not."

Flawless Masterpiece,"I made an account just to review this film. I have been hyped since the first trailer dropped (which I must have watched several dozen times, and several more in the run up to the release), and had the pleasure of seeing it last night.This was hands down one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have had the pleasure of being part of. There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already. The hype is honestly real and deserved.Everything from Joaquin Phoenix's performance to the music score, directing, and especially the writing, was flawless. This was such a beacon of hope in a time when big blockbuster CG films are all the rage. All that matters when you strip that away are characters. If you don't have great characters, no matter how pretty your film looks, it's not worth the time of day - and this film proves that. I hope more directors and writers learn a thing or two from this. And I don't mean to copy: I mean to write better characters and stories.I'll touch on the negative media reviews quickly by just saying: once in a blue moon, a masterful piece of art like this comes around, and of course the media try to create a moral panic around it. I won't deny that aspects and themes of the film are relevant to this day and age. After all, art is a reflection of the society it was created in. There's two levels to art: face value and what the piece itself represents at its core, and then its wider connections to the real world. It's up to us how we interpret it, and that's what art is supposed to do - to get people talking. This film has certainly done that, and it's a good thing. It's one of those films that will be studied and looked back on in a hundred years, for both its cinematic marvels as well as its relevance to today.tl;dr 9999999999999/10 would watch again"

A flawless and unique departure from comic book movies.,"Joker; the movie I never knew I needed. A cinematic breakthrough in the comic book movie genre, that despite being overly referred to as a masterpiece, is for sure a masterpiece. Todd Phillips directs Joker, the character study centred around Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix. A mentally ill man shunned by society, who finds himself on a rather dark path of discovery. This is undeniably the breath of fresh air the genre has needed since James Mangold's Logan.Without doubt the films greatest success, is it's ability to have you empathise and sympathise with an antagonist. Todd Phillips took one of the greatest 'villains' in comic history, and made him a relatable character. Utilising the character study format of story telling was key to accomplishing this success, as seeing the events of Arthur Fleck's life through his own eyes feels as engaging as ever. Remaining on the 'dark and gritty' side of comic book movies, the plot consists of many appropriate comments on todays society which add to not only the character of the joker but help shed light on a subject very present in our time. Make no mistake, this is a vastly disturbing film at times, the synergy between Hildur Guðnadóttin's gripping score and the imagery on screen is like a schizophrenic nightmare in the best way possible. I don't think I've ever endured such range of emotions throughout a film before. Joaquin Phoenix masterfully embodies the role of both Arthur Fleck and Joker, which is putting it lightly.Visuals and production design are a phenomenal display. Gotham City not only feels like an authentic city, but becomes a character in itself. The film is enriched with colour grading and light/shadows that accommodate what tone is being conveyed. This is a film that uses visual storytelling where it can and to it's best advantage, a unique aspect of Joker. The movie in general certainly feels inspired by some of Martin Scorsese's flicks, which only makes sense due to former arrangements for him to produce, if you're a fan of Scorsese you're sure to get a kick out of this film. As I mentioned beforehand this film is a breath of fresh air for the genre. This isn't your typical superhero punch em' up loaded with insane visual effects, action and world-devastating events. This is a charmingly stylised, grounded depiction of a comic book character who could theoretically exist. Again, Pheonix puts everything into this character and embodies his role. Todd Phillips' passion project met with Joaquin Phoenix's immaculate performance creates something really special that seems to have earned itself the title of an instant classic.Whether you're hunting a flawless movie or you're just tired of the loud theme parks comic book movies have become today and are looking for something truly unique, this one exceeds all expectations."

I would highly recommend this film but be warned it does deal with mental illness and depression on a whole different scale to which hasn't been touched on before in a film (that I know of).
I would defiantly go see this over and over again. Not much else I can really say without spoiling any of the scenes/plot but just got and see it and make your own mind up.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Film of the Year. Phoenix is superb!,"A truly stunning film. Shown from the perspective of a mentally ill comedian/clown who the viewer is encouraged to empathise with. Shot through with some scenes of shockingly brutal and visceral violence. Joaquin Phoenix has never been better and gives a tour de force performance that fascinates, horrifies and excites the audience. Use of a Gary Glitter song has caused some controversy, but the music perfectly fits the edgy, amoral dichotomy of the character. Believe the hype, go see it. It deserves a hatful of Oscars, especially for JP.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Absolutely Amazing Performance,"Never really been a Joaquin Phoenix fan but his performance in this movie was out of this world! For those that felt this movie was boring completely missed the point, this wasn't intended to be a CGI filled action flick. This movie dove into the madness of a man who then becomes The Joker and JP hit it out of the park, Heath Ledger would've been proud!

Masterpiece of how the joker was born,"I have to say that what we have here is a one off Masterpiece film directed by Todd Philips. First congrats to him and his team for putting out there one of the best realistic comic films of all time. This is where DC beat marvel because the DC villain Joker and Harvey Dent can actual happen in real life.So first to all comic fans, calm down and remember that this is a very different take on the Joker. this film does not follow any of the comic materials. This film has been made in a realistic way where it shows how society can push someone to their limits and we humans can effect people lives without even notice them.This films is a story about how someone can be pushed because of how society can treat and push someone and when someone has nothing to lose you will start to do things that you have never done. This guy was pushed so much that he started not to care and wanted to just feel good about himself. He started to find himself and his confidence is growing by the end of the film.You can't compare this joker version to any of there other joker version especially Heath's Joker because in the Dark Knight his version of the Joker has already established himself as the clown prince of crime where as Joaquin version of the Joker does not really know who he is, as the film goes on, he is trying to find himself and by the end of the film it looks like he has found himself that he looks set to explore who he is and I hope that if we can get two more films then each of the films will explore how he becomes the clown prince of crime and how he comes the most feared villain of Gotham city and Batman's most hated enemy.So remember when you hardcore comic fans watch this film, you need to remember that this is kinda of like an origins story of how someone in this case, this person becomes the joker who is becoming the someone who later will be known as the Joker or not. we have to many fan theories like this is this first joker and then we have three jokers but whatever, forget about all of the theories and go and enjoy this masterpiece. This film has a amazing soundtrack which strengthen all of the scenes which makes this film even more special. Also its not any other comic film like marvel who use too much CGI and most of their villains are not realistic which makes it sometimes not believe. I say that this film beats Marvel endgame and this has to be my favourite comic film of this year. I hope we get to see more two more films of this version of the Joker.This film does focus on people who suffer mental illness and it shows how we need to help more people in the world who suffer with mental illness and also treat everyone with full respect and help each other.So please to all fans, go and watch this film in the cinema as this is one of those films that you must watch in the cinema not at your home. This film was so emotional for me and it got me up my chair a few times. I will rate this film 5/5 stars and 10/10 rating."
Somehow able to exceed expectations,"Amidst all the hype and controversy, Joaquin Phoenix shines as bright as this film is dark. The score perfectly sets the mood and acts as an eerie backdrop to the film throughout. The plot is revealed from the story and doesn't rely on narration to carry the film. You can tell Joaquin Phoenix did his homework, his portrayal of a mentally ill man struggling to survive in a time of economic hardship is masterful. He is supported by a well selected cast, including the best depiction of Bruce Wayne seen on screen. They didn't reduce Dante Pereira-Olson's Bruce into a whining bratty child as many incarnations usually do. The movie mixes the plight of our down on his luck protagonist and provides an in depth look into the current sociologic climate, without weighing down the film. An excellent blend of comic accuracy and realism is used to create something comic fans and movie fans without knowledge of the character can both enjoy.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
The greatest piece of cinematography I have ever seen,"This film will go down in history. Simply amazing. The whole team behind this film should be commended, as well as proud of what they have produced. Throughout the years there are many films which simply come from Hollywood and satisfy viewers but are predictable with limited long lasting impact. This is not one of those films, you will walk out of Joker with your head in the stars, unable to Express what you have just seen. Joaquin delivers the best character portrayal I have ever seen, displaying the transition from Arthur Fleck to the Joker right the way through the film. I found myself smiling at his ability to deliver a perfect personality and mannerisms which we saw from Ledger, and although Heath gave us an amazing foundation when creating his Joker, I honestly believe Joaquin has made Heath proud. I don't believe I will see a film of this capacity for a very long time, and it is almost certain the film will win best actor and best director come the Oscar's in 2020.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Outstanding Movie; Very Realistic Story Line,"This movie opens up what goes into the mind of a troubled person. Scenes and circumstances is very relatable for the viewers and you can really feel how messed up Joker's life was prior to being Joker. In real life, these things happen behind the scene. While everyone thought everyone should be happy, there are times that life will not allow you to be. To be honest, the story line itself could trigger a lot of things. It could encourage people to stand up for themselves but the ""how"" of it will depend on the people. Truly, Joker set a high bar for other super hero movies. It showed the dark side of reality and the selfishness of humanity.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Deeply moving.

The film indeed makes you feel unpleasant, scared and anxious, but why some people think that's a bad thing? It just demonstrates how good this movie is, immersing you in the story from begging to end. The fact that you sympathize with a mistreated person only makes you human, It has nothing to do with agreeing with violence. On the contrary, it makes you realize how we should be more compassionate, and care about other people.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Surreal experience....,"I don't write reviews too often for films I see however as much as I didn't expect much coming into this movie I left with a profound sense of awareness of society around us and just what may set off certain people in such a violent manner after years of taking abuse from others and often for no other reason than careless spite and taking pleasure in someone else's misery.
The movie is truly a social statement more than anything else that many may find odious or hard to swallow but one doesn't have to look far to see how the film speaks to a lot of truths we'd rather ignore and make excuses for.
As for Joaquin Phoenix I never had much of an opinion of his acting abilities but this movie has certainly heightened his standing in my view and rivals if not surpasses Heath Ledger's portrayal in 2008.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A Masterpiece.,"Many reviews here describe the movie as being: amazing, brilliant, a masterpiece and a work of art. None of those descriptions are wrong. The Joker is an extremely dark, powerful look into the mind of a man quickly descending into his own madness and inability to cope with the harsh, cruel world that surrounds him. In a cinematic world that's currently dominated by comic book movies laced with humour and CGI FX, it's ironic that a movie about The Joker provides none of that, but instead is the most serious and real of them all.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Absolutely BLOWN. AWAY.,"I never write reviews but this film has been ingrained in my head ever since I watched it that I was compelled to do so. It blew past my expectations, to say the least and my expectations were already sky high. Everything was so perfect! I'll try to keep it short as I break down what stood out for me.First, the film's score. It was so well made I cannot stress this enough. It fit every single scene and made them that much more powerful. It establishes a connection between you and the character. I felt what he was going through to the point where i was rooting for him.The cinematography was beautiful! Whether it was a close shot focusing on the joker or simply a wide shot showcasing the environment around him, it was astonishing.The acting was phenomenal and that is an understatement in my opinion. Joaquin immensely knocked it out of the park. He embodied the character so well. I truly believe this is one of the best if not the BEST adaptation of the joker.I will say 1 thing for those who are hesitant towards comic book movies, it did not feel like such. Even if you're not a fan of comic books, you can still enjoy it as much as anyone else. It has such a deep meaning which will leave you thinking for days. This film will truly, without a doubt, leave a huge mark in cinematic history."
So much better than I thought it was going to be!!,"I don't understand why people walked out of this film as it was a masterpiece!!
The violence was not over the top and very much in keeping with the Joker character, and what a performance by Phoenix it was! Never thought I would say this but it is on the same level as Heath Ledger's portrayal!! He must get the Oscar!!
The look of the film was beautiful and certainly gave the film an extra edge!

Great standalone movie,"First of all, I'm not good with Comics and anything Marvel/DC related. I don't know any stories, or any facts whatsoever. I went to watch Joker as a standalone movie, like any other movie; and it was great.It is a slow paced movie. Methodical; you pretty much get to sympathize with Arthur Fleck; you get his pain and his delusions. Joaquin's performance is top notch!I liked this portrait of the Joker. A delusional maniac, hysterical, insane. When you see the Joker's' development into a satyrical killer, his descent into madness, it's fantastic.Overall, good movie! Not sure if it breaks any paradigm over what's in the books/comics, but, as a standalone movie, it is good.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The Joker of our time,"What an experience. At first I did not want to believe the hype. I avoided the trailers and wanted to experience this movie with a fresh mind. And what an absolute pleasure it was watching it.The movie beautifully and elegantly captures the perfect portrait of the Joker of our time. All the Jokers we had were portrayed to their timeline. And today, where mental illness is relevant in our society, this is the perfect adaptation of the Joker in our time.You cannot compare Heath Ledger's joker with Joaquin Phoenix's. Both had incredible performances, but Phoenix's joker is different. This is not the criminal mastermind we are used to. This Joker is broken and shattered.Overall, this is the best movie of the year. I wouldn't be surprised of this movie got nominated, as well as Phoenix's performance"
A masterpiece that Joaquin deserves a bow for!,"Oh, what an experience it was to watch this legend perform such a challenging role! He didn't just act, he brought Joker to life. There was not a second where I found the movie to be boring. It had my full attention so much so that I couldn't look away from the screen.

Outstanding.,"Joker delivers what it promises and more. A twisted tale of a sick man corrupted by a decadent society. It's clear the script was carefully written, and Phillips directed the hell out of it. Guðnadóttir's work also stands out, the music is as ominous and dark as the film itself. Finally Phoenix's performance as Arthur is something else, absolutely remarkable and Oscar-worthy. He carries the whole film on his shoulders with his performance, totally different from Ledger's but as riveting and astonishing.
Joker shows us more about the man behind the makeup, still it doesn't make anything entirely clear, forcing you doubt and rethink to everything you see. And that sometimes dangerous ambiguity is for the better in the movie, for it is carried out masterfully.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Thank you Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix,"This is a masterpiece.
A bold statement but a true statement,
Ok this movie is getting a lot of hate And a lot of praise at the same time as it is like marmite you will either love it or not understand and fear and hate it, stating that it's promoting ill deads... it's not you need to understand it and remember it's most importantly art in the form of a film/movie.Always keep in mind it's a fictional story with fictional characters, which is difficult to do as the direction and acting are so good.
Now imagine your very darkest thought's and feeling the one's you never tell anyone,the one's that make you feel physically ill and the one's you would never act on because of your ethics your integrity and your morals,now take them time's them by 10 . That's the feeling you get from this extremely dark and thought provoking story of a man who has past the limit of sanity due to ill health and the toll of a negative outside world.
It's upsetting and moving to see such atrocities, the cruelty of man against his fellow man..
But this is true to Life,if you treat someone so badly you will break them,if life is so bad to you it will effect you, the portrayal of this side of man's inhumanity to Man is superbly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix he pulls you into the suffering in a way that you don't want to be pulled in.The violence that insues is an equal and opposite reaction to the original actions in Arthur fleck mind, a man that suffers from mental health issues and is then bullied, beaten and mentally abused by every one around him.
During the film you feel sorry for him you feel sickened by him and you feel hate for him, the sign of a truly good performance.
I don't want to Go into any further details as I'm not the type of person to spoil it for others.
The lighting the camera work and music are a perfect backdrop for this truly disturbing glips into a comic book villians backstory...a true testiment to a great director.
My leaving comments would be looking back at the real world and some of it's band wagon hopping on statements...
This is a movie,a piece of art, and an excellent movie it is.
If you as a person can't handle how dark and disturbing it is then that's okay just walk out, it's perfectly fine to do so
But please don't trash it cause it wasn't for you.
Its not promoting gun crime
It's not demoting mental health issues
It's not promoting violence.
It's a film"

Out of the darkness the joker is born,"First off I have to say this is one of my favourite films of the year.
Joaquin Phoenix plays a great portrayal as Arthur Fleck the man who in turn becomes the Joker, trying to fit into society and let down by society and Joaquin should win an Oscar for his performance in the film.Other reviews giving low scores saying it's not a joker film and not like Leto or Ledger. Each actor adds their stamp to a role as this isn't what Joaquin has done plus this movie is set before Arthur becomes the joker so it's all the back story leading up to the finale and the birth of the joker.People giving this film poor votes must not appreciate the film and yes it's a dark film but it portrays life and life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.I'd certainly go back to the cinema for a second viewing"
THE Joker and more !!!,"Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe-in for Best Actor at next year's Oscars unless Daniel Day Lewis comes out of retirement and does something truly extraordinary. This film will bridge the gap between comic book geeks and serious cineastes because of his performance and the direction of Todd Philips. Never has Gotham looked so exhausted as it does here. No surprise that it is Joker's breeding ground. Helpless and hopeless, no wonder that he turns against the ""haves"".
The Joker has proved an iconic role. Just as we talk about Olivier's Henry V or Karloff's Monster or Chaney's Lenny, in the future we will be looking at Phoenix and saying ""yes,it's his defining role"". His speech, his body shape, his eyes - all come together to chill you to the bone. Yet there is poignancy there and inevitability and anarchy. The best film of 2019 with nothing to beat it unless Abrams pulls something out of the hat with ""The Rise of Skywalker"".3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Not a movie for everyone but a masterpiece nonetheless.,"Going into this film, I was unsure on what to think. I didn't wanna go in believing all the hype this movie had gotten but, I knew Joaquin Phoenix was one the best actors alive so I went into the movie with high expectations.Now, this movie might not be for everyone. It shifts in tone and pace a lot, there are political messages not everyone may get or enjoy. You mustn't go into this movie thinking it's your run-of-the-mill hero/villain flick', because it is anything but. This movie takes its viewers on a ride through many emotions present in the film. The script is beautifully written and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing in this rendition of the Joker character. He brings a different side of the Joker out for this film. Something I dont believe any of the former actors to have portrayed the Joker brought which is a sense of vulnerability. A sense of pain and sadness.I recommend you see the movie for yourself. It may not be a movie everyone will enjoy, but I believe it was perfectly executed and a downright masterpiece."
A stunning artistic achievement - DC at its peak,"JOKER (2019) directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Pheonix in the role of a lifetime as the titular character, is a film that explores the complexity, stigma and volatility of severe mental illness. Set in the fictional DC metropolis, Gotham City, Joker paints a nasty portrait of a damaged city, struggling with rising crime, disillusionment and 'super rats'.Arthur Fleck is barely existing as a clown for hire, living with his elderly mother in their tiny apartment; their only relief from the tragedy of their lives is watching America's favourite late-night host, Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) on their old television. Arthur has delusions of grandeur, imagining himself as a successful stand-up comedian, which is ironic based on his 'condition' that elicits unprovoked and uncontrollable laughter in stressful situations. A journal contains all his dark thoughts and is littered with disturbing images and expressions of suicidal ideation.The film depicts Arthur's descent into psychopathy, through revelations and events that call into the question the reality he was brought up with. The film may be deeply disturbing for some, particularly the scenes of graphic violence, that play out with the same level of overt intensity and clarity as the rest of the film - nothing is held back. In fact, the audience is left in a confusing state between horror and humour, since many of these disturbing scenes include brilliant moments of levity.That's right, it's not all psychological horror, there are moments of humour that is the result of Pheonix's mannerisms and his diabolical laugh. It's a physical performance, while director Todd Phillips maintains a consistently gloomy colour palette that is broken only by the clown paint and the clown masks that show up at various points in the film.Speaking of Pheonix, he is incredible, fully inhabiting this character and creating a genuine debate as to which Joker performance was better: him or Heath Ledger. Although such a discussion is unnecessary since they are both transcendent in their own way.JOKER is a truly incredible artistic statement that will be remembered, revered and talked about as much as the last great DC film, The Dark Knight (2008). While I am hesitant to pump out a review immediately after seeing it once, there is no doubt I will watch it again and again and wait impatiently for the next one.Highly, highly recommended

Reviews like the ones I've read online for blogs, newspapers and other news sites continue to make me lose faith in the supposed movie critics. After seeing their reviews and then going to see this movie, I am pretty much convinced that majority of them are just a bunch of hacks and their reviews are written prior to them actually seeing a movie. I can only hope that this Joker movie isn't just the origin for the Joker, but the origin story for the next Batman. Well done Joaquin Phoenix.What happens if you had just the absolute worst day of your life? Or worst week? That's what happens to the Joker in the comics. And this portrayal of this unfortunate man who, coupled with a city facing civil unrest and growing resentment of upper classes and disdain for lower ones ends with something that could actually happen. Is it right? Is the character one to be empathized? No. He makes bad decisions. He does terrible things. But that is the JOKER. Go for the story, go for the drama. Not for action. And not if you're one of these holier than though critics that write negative reviews just to bolster their own credibility but lack an attention span to actually watch an entire movie."

Absolutely Brilliant,"This was one of the best films I've seen in more than a decade. The character development was amazing and Joaquin was nothing short of spectacular. It wasn't what I expected and that was refreshing. It's a human experience and is relevant to our society, as sad as that is. I was thinking about this film for days after I viewed it. Thought provoking. Tragic and insightful. A must see.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Brilliant, Mesmerizing Performance and perfect direction","Joker was a movie that comes along only so often and completely blows you away. You could hear a pin drop in our full theater. Joaquin had Ana amazing, Oscar worthy performance and I can't believe Todd Phillips directed the Hangover movies but now accomplished this.It's as disturbing as Requiem for a Dream if you've seen that, not the most disturbing movie I've ever seen (2008's Martyrs takes the cake) but this is up there! And it is depressing as well but there are moments of laughter. I don't want to give anything away but if you have a tolerance for something a little more disturbing, I promise this is worth your time!The websites saying it sucks are snowflake pansies that don't want to watch anything that might ""offend"" sensitive people. Nonsense. Go see it!3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A masterpiece.,"This movie is a masterpiece. I just saw it in the theater today and I will go see it again. This is an amazing origin story for Joker and his minions. It is also a commentary about how far left ideology (Antifa), the media terrorizing people with exaggeration and lies, cities run by corrupt people until they are filled with trash, rats, sickness, and homeless, and turning our back on the mentally ill can lead some people to total desperation and violence. It doesn't endorse violence, but I do think it explains how some people end up there. It should be a warning. Don't let negative news take your hope and make you apathetic. Choose kindness. Don't wait for corrupt leaders to fix cities they have let go to ruin - make the city better yourself (like Scott Presler)! After doing what you can for your community, make sure to expose the people who are corrupt and taking in millions, or billions of dollars and somehow never fixing the problems in the cities that they run. Last but not least, we do need to have a better support system for the severely mentally ill, and not the waste of money NY city is doing right now. We need to help the millions of severely mentally ill people currently on the streets, not just have ""feel good"" programs that may prevent more.God Bless America."

Joaquin Phoenix for the win!,"""I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize..... it's a comedy""WOW. Now that's what I call an agent of chaos. Best actor goes to Joaquin Phoenix for his incredible intense mind blowing performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker. This is the origin story to beat all origin stories. I was thoroughly entranced for 2 hours watching his painful transition from a beaten down sad sack to the famous insane maniacal narcissist we all know & love. I will have to see this on the big screen again soon, it was a brilliantly laid out psychological character study that gave me a lot to think about when it comes to the DC world of the caped crusader's nemesis I've always known. This story has a major shift to how I've perceived the crazed, hapless, clownfaced criminal, since I first saw him portrayed by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, & of course, fairly different than the outstanding portrayal by Heath in TDK. Arthur just keeps having one bad day after another, so I felt sorry for him in this story as I never had before.The score by Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir that was heavily powered by her dramatic cello was a perfect match to show how this story unfolds, & the classic Sinatra songs, ""Send in the Clowns"" & ""That's Life"" along with ""Jimmy Durante's ""Smile"" were a natural choice for the soundtrack as well as several old rock songs like Cream's ""White Room"", The Guess Who's ""Laughing"", The Doors ""People Are Strange"", Pink Floyd's ""Brain Damage"", & The Bee Gees ""I Started A Joke"" (just to name a few) went so well with the character development.If you're expecting a comic book super villain story similar to the previous versions of Joker on the big screen, you might be disappointed. However, go see this with an open mind & watch the goddamn genius that is Joaquin play Joker as he's never been played before & maybe you'll love it like I did."
Haunting and wonderful.,"This is not an easy watch, but it sure as Hell is a rewarding one.Phoenix hits it out of the park as Arthur Fletch and his descent into madness is a display like no other. The supporting cast are superb, the soundtrack is phenomenal, I really can't find a bad word to say about this film. It's a masterpiece.It's a slow burn, but that works really well for the tale the movie tells. When it does ramp up, it really ramps up, with the final act being a terrifying thrill ride.The feeling I got watching this film was reminiscent of watching Breaking Bad through for the first time. It was uncomfortable, but extraordinary, and I couldn't look away from start to finish.10/10, outstanding."

Absolutely BREATHTAKING movie and role play by Joaquin Phoenix,"First of all, let me say that I cannot emphasize enough how mind blowing this movie is. I don't know how I am supposed to enjoy a movie after this, it just won't be as good.
But let's get into it. It has been a long time since I hadn't watched a DC movie in which the scenario and the role play took over the actions and the commercial frills. This movie is realistic. It reflects the reality of a society that we might live in someday in the near future. I was also iBut the real asset of this masterpiece is Joaquin Phoenix. I don't want to fall into unfair comparisons with Heath Ledger, for the latter has had the chance to have a whole movie centered on his character. However, I just cannot imagine a more genuine, breathtaking performance as Joaquin's. I was in total admiration on each of his scenes and Joker laughs. He nailed them all. Also, the evolution of his character all along makes each segment of the movie more intense and more mind blowing than the previous.
If you're not a comic fan, this movie can easily lead you to it. It gives you chills. It's an absolute masterpiece that's not ready to be topped.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

DC's Dark Game Changer,"This film was everything I wanted it to be and more. DC should stop trying to do what Marvel has and capitalise on this realistic R-rated style and tone for their films. Not many people could pull off a convincing Joker for an entire film, and neither did Phoenix. This film is about Arthur's transformation, he doesn't fully become Joker until the very end of the film.
This is the story of a man's descent into madness done in the most realistic way possible, taking little inspiration from source material and focusing on what makes the character at his core so polarising.
Aside from the incredible acting, the cinematography, score and pacing of the film married perfectly with Phoenix's take. No screen time was wasted, everything that happened had a purpose or a meaning.
The inclusion of the Waynes in the story was a surprise but a welcome one.
Laying the groundwork for the upcoming Matt Reeves Batman film potentially.
I truly do hope we get to see Phoenix do Joker properly in a future film, but for now I hope this is the catalyst to start the DC Dark series with more films in this realistic R-rated style and tone made for adults and not kids."

IM DA JOKA BABY!,"From all of the kinos Joaquin Phoenix has been apart of, he can still give performances that secedes and compliments each role by unlocking the human experience. You're not supposed to feel empathy towards an autistic psychopath (incel), but Phoenix's adaptation of The Joker gives a nuanced perspective towards the cliched archetype. Critics who fear that this film will incite violence and inspiration towards the incel community are right. Had it been any other actor up for the role, they would have not touched the downtrodden so easily. 10/10 BNM3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Best comic book film of all time.,"Not only is the Joker the best comic book adaptation on film I have ever seen, it is by far the best film of 2019 I've seen. The moments that gave me chills were the scene when Arthur is holding little Bruce's face and then when he is in the stairwell with his mother's medical chart and verifies everything Tom Wayne told me was true about his mother. Learning everything he thought he knew was a lie and the anger that grew within him that bought him to such disillusionment with his world it made him kill the one person he most loved in his world and turn him into the psychopathic killer. Her death killed Arthur Fleck and reincarnated him into the Joker. The twist with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz ) was brilliant and totally unexpected.Wow. This film was like a Greek Tragedy play. This is the film I wish all other comic book movies were modeled after. Nothing is over the top, everything is plausible in this realistic world. No super powers or grandiose schemes. Arthur Fleck is just a regular man like the Waynes, but without the fortunes of the Waynes. Just a man who beleaguered with abuse, lies, manipulation and misfortune that snaps into the killer he becomes.I did not want the movie to end because I loved it so much. My bladder was at the point of bursting but I did not want to leave my seat and miss a thing. This is a titanium scribed A++. It is rare I think of any movie as a perfect 10 out of 10, but this movie hit that score. I was left thinking about this film hours after I left the theater. DC Black finally blew away everything Marvel had out of the water with this film. All thanks to a super talented film director and one of the best actors of our era Joaquin Phoenix. If the Oscars don't see it fit to grant him an award, then the Oscars have no redeeming value."
Absolute masterpiece.,"Well, where do I start. This movie is phenomenal and if Phoenix does not get an Oscar, I really do not know who should. I have seen numerous way worse Oscar winners and performance of this man was not only very good or convincing - it was hypnotic.However, I have a one huge advice for everyone willing to see this movie - DO NOT watch is as a superhero movie (do not try to compare him to previous Jokers, do not try to follow the lore, etc.). You will be disappointed. It is an utterly different genre and experience.Watch it from the point of view that every single one of us may be in Joker's place. We just need one bad (good) day. And only then this movie will reveal its brightest colors.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

ART,"An extraordinary movie, the message is strong and we must all be kind to all people and respect them! An accumulation of extreme situations, which I can say may even be realistic and quite possible at that period of time, because there was not as much information as there is today, although there is a lot of bullying these days and can sometimes be an unfortunate cause of some dramatic situations that happen, but as a fictional movie (that's what it is), I think overall the movie is almost perfect! I don't know if will be considered for Best Picture due to the hypocrisy that exists in the United States, but Phoenix deserves to win any awards that appear, it is the best role of his career! From the beginning to the end of the movie it's a brutal character transformation and he drove it to the limit to embody a Fiction character who was always been an psychopath and let's say he already deserves it for a long time! And a casting that fits the story very well, although they rarely appear, are crucial to the development of this character. I'm sorry it's just this movie made by Todd Phillips and Phoenix ... But I have a little hope that Phoenix will be able to reconsider returning to the role in Matt Reeves's batman movie, as a older joker, if not I think Dc (Dc Black) could advance with more mature movies like this one! 9.5"
Pure cinematic bliss,"Now THIS is a comic book movie worthy of oscar attention. There's a lot going on here. We see the inside of a troubled man as he goes through the transformation of turning into DC's finest villain. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix have created an emotional, brutal and almost painful film to watch (in a good way). The film follows Arthur Fleck's character throughout the entire run-time and the audience is pulled into this sad man's life as everything just seems to be tumbling around him. The way people treat him and the way his behavior unintentionally makes others uncomfortable is tough to watch but it is a brutal reminder of the hardships faced by people like him. Watching him turn into this downward spiral into the villainous Joker is entertaining, rewarding and disturbing. The film is about the evolution of this broken down man trying to find a place in society and then taking another path instead. This is a tragic tale done excellently. The cinematography and score is stunning, the directing is extremely good as well. The use of songs in the film are very well done. Every character really sells their role in the film, from the bullies, to the ones that try to help, to the extras in the talk show. Everyone brings their A-game into this film and nothing feels out of place. Joker is destined to be a cult classic and it's a hopeful change in direction for comic based films. This is a movie that will be remembered for a long time."

"Brilliance That'll Send Chills, and clowns","One of the most anticipated films of the year, and one of the most unwanted, at first. Following Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto, and (the best) Health Ledger, was not easy but they got another renowned actor, Joaquin Phoenix, to play his take on the notorious villain. On top of the actor, the direction was up in the air and the choice of giving the reins over to Hangover director Todd Phillips was more worrisome. However, knowing Phoenix takes choosing his roles very seriously-only picking up the good ones-made having confidence in Phillips easier. Having a director suddenly switch genres and go in a totally different direction has been seen before and with Phillips, we get the surprise, and laugh, that we wanted.
Joker delivers exactly what you'd expect and want and then gives you more than you ever could have imagined. This film pushes the boundaries, it gives the gritty realism of the world's cruel moments their spotlight. It may receive backlash for it's brutally honest portrayals, it has already even before it was released. Though, it will definitely leave you thinking about it's many messages as you sit and watch the credits roll with Sinatra's perfectly themed song.
The controversies are created by the stirring up of the thoughts in the audiences' minds after witnessing Arthur Fleck's character development. This buzz does good in making this film more popular but more importantly gets the public to think more about the lessons to be learned about how to treat others. Sure, the main takeaways can easily be focused on the violence depicted and how striking it is, but it's the journey leading up to the acts that should be pondered on more. It's this very character arc that makes this movie so powerful and moving. It's brutal but it's real, that's what hits home the most.
Phoenix's performance is lived-up to and yes, Oscar-worthy. He clearly has taken preparation for the role seriously since he's lost over 50 pounds and nailed the sinister, contagious laugh, making his own twist on it by making it a condition of an uncontrollable laughter that Fleck has. You are glued to every scene he is in, waiting to see what unpredictable thing he'll do next, which is exactly who the Joker is at his core. Chaos.
There's also beautiful cinematography that complements with the subtle, yet terrifying, score. The clear and present Scorsese influence and nods-to are seen and invited, Robert freakin' De Niro is in this, come on people. Phillips also really brings us into this grimy urban 80's setting of Gotham perfectly. The cold harsh streets littered with trash and the poverty-stricken rundown housing.
Since there has been so much worrisome talk about this film, before it even was released to the world, you have to get the hint that it is not one to miss. However, when you do see it, go in as open-minded as possible or just go with premeditated ideas, the Joker is sure to rattle you anyways by the end of it. Either way, the messages and thought-provoking questions that this film instills into the audience is what truly sets this film apart. It's a masterful work of original filmmaking and we get to witness it, so please, sit back and just smile.

Visceral tension throughout,"A jaw dropping masterpiece of filmmaking. I kept waiting for it to get violent as the media hyped this to be something that would trigger would-be psychopaths. And though it had a few intense scenes, what made Joker a film that put me on the edge of my seat and caused me to forget to breathe was those moments when Arthur Fleck was so alone with his thoughts and fantasies; that he allowed himself to dive headlong into, making the audience question of what they were seeing was really happening to the character. I often found myself empathizing with the pain Phoenix placed inside of the character. And I could almost never anticipate what he was going to do next. That is what made me afraid, for two hours, to draw my next breath.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Impressed to say the least,"Having just finished watching, I am stunned to say the least.
Jaquines' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation
to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition.
As unfortunate event after unfortunate event baraded the Joker leading to circumstantial wrong-doings, I truly felt for the character, while also being aware that his actions were wrong.
Amidst the action packed superhero movies presented today (and as much as I do enjoy those as well) this movie is truly in a league of it's own.
Joker takes the lore and characters we have grown to love and revere as immeasurable beings, and throws it in your face as an all too real, true to life possibility.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
I am awestruck!!!,"Oh man, my jaw is on the floor back at the theater! As many great movies as there have been this year, this one takes the cake for me! Besides being a fantastic character study of The Joker, this is such an important social commentary that I think should bring up some much needed conversations. Joaquin Phoenix is a god and this is right up there with his best work in The Master, You Were Never Really Here, Her, Two Lovers, Inherent Vice and more. Todd Phillips deserves so much praise for bringing this beautifully twisted portrait to life. Everything from the cinematography to the score to screenplay was just perfect. I'm still gathering my thoughts and have soooo many. I think this is a film people are gonna be and should be talking about for a while. I am awestruck and gotta go see it again as soon as possible!3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
What makes the perfect villain?,"Heath Ledger showed us that a truly terrifying antagonist can't be reasoned with. Joaquin Phoenix now shows us how anyone can even reach such a point. Joker is a character study of the clinically insane and wildly unfortunate comedian/clown looking for a break in Gotham.The film's primary strength is the first-rate performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it is further bolstered by a number of interesting creative choices and sound fundamentals. Sound is putting it modestly. The prodigious score by Hildur Guðnadóttir marches the plot forward as cinematographer Lawrence Sher always seems to find the perfect shot. This all comes together into a fantastic whirlwind of surprise and jaw-dropping disbelief as director Todd Phillips plays with audience and character perception like puppets on a string.Joker is relentless in its character building and storytelling. It is without a doubt, film of the year."
Brutal piece of art!,"Man, it blew my mind!As a Joker fan, I was eager to see Joaquim Phoenix's portrait of the Mad Clown. I was really excited, but the flick was beyond my expectations.It made me CRINGE, it made me CARE for the character. I felt for him many times, even knowing that the evil was there, lurking inside. It's a descent into madness, and it also makes us think about our place in a society. Are we paying enough attention? Are we caring enough for people who really need us?The Joker is a villain, of course, but he's also a victim. Or better: he's first the victim and THEN the (wicked) villain.The scene when he's ""turned"" into the psychotic and dangerous clown we all love to fear, is EPIC. The soundtrack, the score... DAMN, that was amazing!Phoenix delivers an IMPRESSIVE work and deserves all the recognition! What an actor, my friends, what an actor..."
Must see!,It's a work of art. Everything from the music choices to the acting to cinematography and story progression is absolutely astounding. It gives a massive amount of background in his life and what turned him into the beautiful mess he becomes. I'll definitely be wat Hing this again and again.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

"Hard to watch, hard to look away.","By the time the roll credits started to show up, I was still not prepared to properly rate this movie. I would say it's one of the most overwhelming experience I've had in the cinema. After letting it simmer for a while, I'm definitely confident to say that it's one of the best movies this year thus far.The story of ""Joker"" shows us the downward spiral of Arthur Fleck, a down-on-his-luck comedian and a mentally unstable man with a disorder that prompts him to laugh uncontrollably at any situation that causes stress.That's enough of a plot description, because what you are about to see is a harrowing journey that at some point will make you so uncomfortable you almost can't bear it. Not saying that it went too far, violence-wise, but it's almost too depressing to be entertaining.Joaquin Phoenix embodies the character so well and convincing that you can't help but be in awe of what he has achieved here. It's almost a one-man show, to be honest. The side characters are sidelined (pun intended) just so we could witness his transformation from this meek, nice guy to the titular Joker. Still, Robert DeNiro as the talk show host also served as a highlight.I'd also say that I was never bored throughout the 2-hour runtime, given the grim and oppressive nature of the story. The slow-burn pacing is top notch and contrasted with some gruesome violence. Yes, it has visual cues from Scorcese classics (the aforementioned ""Taxi Driver"" is one of them) but there's nothing to distract me as unoriginal or something of a copy and paste. Some developments are really surprising and managed to bring some intrigue that will bring viewers to question what's really true or not, most importantly how it ties with a particular character (you could guess who it is).I gotta say that this has the best third act any movie could offer. My jaw dropped right at the climax for how audacious and sharp the way things were handled in it. There are powerful messages on how society works and how we should treat people with mental illness, especially to people like Arthur in this day and age that will resonate with me long after I watched it.Overall, I do think it has a staying power to be an essential movie or a classic outside the comic-book genre. Despite the controversy and the polarizing reviews, I'd recommend seeing it for how it pushes the boundary in commercial and mainstream filmmaking."
Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?,"I went back from the movie yesterday. Phoenix definitely deserve an Oscar for this performance.Don't believe the critics, this film was one of the best films I had watched in my life. The critics dislike the film due to political correctness and moral highground. Come on we all know what is happening in the world right now.Yes, the film was definitely disturbing, dark and violence but point to the core problems of our societies. The emptiness of our cultures, the ever widening income gap and the hypocritical of human nature will still be there with or without this movie. At least the director has the guts to point out the problems and let us have the chance to rethink and rebuild our world before it is too late.We don't listen, do we?"

Thank you todd phillips.,"Its very hard to analyze whats going on in this movie, or maybe my head is flooding with words i cant write, since i was a kid i have always been a fan of dc and joker
Seeing him in batman the animated series(1992) or tim burtons take on the character or even reading comics that involved him made me realize not only how complex this particular character is but also how he can be written in so many different ways.
Today im 22 years old, i walked into the theatre thinking that the hype might be coming from fans missing the joker on screen, but hold on a minute, todd wrote and joaquin delivered!.
Legendary performance, great writing, moving score, great use of color pallets and a mesmerizing study/deep look on both the joker and society, thats not all, expressing to you how the joker made me feel throughout the movie is a hard thing to do, so i leave the rest to you.

MASTERPIECE,"#FinalVerdictJoker movie is a thunderous masterpiece! Can easily compete with the best comic book films of all time. The best movie of 2019 which belongs more in the Joaquin Phoenix Universe than the DC Universe.In the media, director Todd Phillips's Joker movie has been frenetically celebrated and a possible Oscars 2020 blessing (otherwise unthinkable for a comic-based film) is speculated violently. Let me say it loud and clear: there is not a word of it exaggerated.Joker movie is an ""origin story"", which tells how poor Arthur, nicknamed Happy by his mother, will become one of the most famous enemies of Batman. However, here there is no question of the Dark Knight, the story unfolds when Bruce Wayne is still a child.Surprisingly, Joker movie is totally a drama. A hard drama, rough, bitter, in a sticky environment. An environment that does not help Arthur to adapt. Director/writer Todd Phillips & cowriter Scott Silver take time to present the characters, places and situations.Joker movie is a work closer to auteur cinema. It's important to note that there's nothing wrong with this movie. Director Todd Phillips manages to infuse a very stylized colorful theme with the dark at the same time. It's bold, devastating & utterly beautiful.The sombre staging tackles you from the first second, shaking you through for two hours and never letting go until the last second. Joker movie is a horror story, not the celebratory tale of an antihero. Joker is a game changer and plays in a league of his own.The great soundtrack consists mainly of classics of the swing era (Frank Sinatra et al) and is an integral part of the plot. The congenial score of Hildur Gudnadottir amplifies the power of the images many times, so that every scene penetrates deep into the bone marrow.Director Todd Phillips is a revelation at the helm and does the best directing job of his career with the twisted material, able to strike a tone that straddles stabs of bleak darkness, gasps of hope and pangs of inevitability. I doff my hat to you sir!DOP Lawrence Sher's no-frills work to emphasize twisted, dark cityscapes, streets & nightmarish forms deserves a huge shout-out. With picture-perfect contrasts & color, sublime compositions, the rich and complex mise-en-scène succeeds in elevating the movie.But all of this impressive, stylish construction wouldn't have worked without Joaquin Phoenix. He inhabits his role with a commitment that's magnetic in its unpredictability. His unbelievable performance will leave the most lasting impression on the audience. Robert De Niro - one of his best roles for a long time! Zazie Beetz is remarkable.I left the cinema with lasting impressions & my mouth open. Beneath this gripping, bold, revisionist psychological thriller, Joker is the comic book villain we deserve right now.Joker movie is a masterpiece! Its understanding doesn't cross the line into sympathy, as we're left watching a man who becomes less & less human as his tragedy unfolds. We repeatedly see him burst into laughter, but can never rule out whether he's actually crying."

Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history,"People criticising this film for being 'dark and disturbing' is purely hypocritical, in my opinion. When you're making a film about the world's most twisted mind, the end result is bound to be dark and disturbing. If not, then the movie clearly hasn't captured what it means to be turned into the Joker. It doesn't matter whether this film has derived inspiration from a few previous films or any other source for that matter; by itself, this film is unique, classy and a sheer masterpiece.7 out of 17 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Literally the best piece of art made in the 21st century,"This movie perfectly encapsulates every feeling I have experienced in my entire life and made it all worth it. This picture is white people's ""Black Panther"", and men's ""The Notebook"". If you don't fall into both of these categories you probably will not understand the beautiful essence of this movie. This is not merely a movie, it's a message, it's a mirror to society and its a masterpiece. It is unfair to only give this a 10/10 rating because it should not be limited to a numerical confinement. Anyone who does not love this movie has not understood it. What we see in this movie is a cruel assault on Arthur by everyone around him. Society chews him up, completely ignoring what makes him different, and he is left with no choice but to force people to acknowledge his illness. If you think this movie might not be for you then you're right.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
It's About a Man,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

It's not about Joker and Gotham but about You and your City,"I USED TO THINK MY WHOLE LIFE IS A TRAGEDY BUT NOW I THINK IT IS A COMEDY....The Film which every person can relate to , JOKER is a must watch for all masses. Directed and co-written by Todd Philips , the film deals with the journey of one of the most infamous villains of the DC Universe. The Journey of Arthur Flek to JOKER and the reasons behind him to become Joker.
CAST :
Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Flek was really a great choice as he perfectly fits into the character. His commandable harwork and mental preperations to get approach to the character would make you fall in love with the actor and the character as well. This was his film. As viewers we never felt that Arthur did anything suddenly. His mannerisms and acts slowly developed through his experiences. Joaquin's nervous laughter referencing it to a psychological condition (Pseudobulbular effect) , his uncontrollable run which portrays his loneliness in the society
Robert De Niro as a late night talk show host, Murray Franklin was brilliant in his performances. It was so refreshing to see sucha legendary actor actually putting a work in a commercially driven film. Although his role was small but it was effective.
STORY:
The film showcases the origin story of one of the infamous villains of the DC Universe. The first look of the film made it clear that it is going to be a masterpiece. Based on the late 1970s in Gotham City when there is extreme social and civil unrest due to high unemployment. The film has been shown through the eyes of Arthur Fleck- working as a clown in Gotham City. The film takes us on a absolute journey of him losing his control over himself , his loneliness , lack of guidance and companionship turns him into the manic state of Joker. AND ONE THING ABOUT THE MASSES WHO HAS NO IDEA ABOUT DC UNIVERSE. This film doesn't glorify the acts of Joker , neither does it has any relation with the Batman series. It simply showcases the USA in 1970s and how the common masses felt oppressed and angry towards the prieveged. How people gravitates anyone who takes a stand. Absolute anarchy can lead a man to do many things and Joker portrays one of them. The fim ends on a note leaving a fine connection between child Bruce and Joker which might even lead to a sequel of the DC series
Reasons why you should watch the film
1. Todd Phillips Direction - It was really praise worthy for the director of Hangover to pull off such a humanistic approach of the Joker.
2. Joaquin's Phoenix acting, as previously said - the man's hardwork can surely bag him an Oscar. His hard work such as loosing his physical and mental health just to fit into the character. His absolute loneliness , sadness and madness have been excellently portrayed by the man.
3. Location and music. The background music was so apt that the masses could easily co-relate Athur's journey of sadness and madness
4. Dialogues. The story has been designed beautifully with the dialogues. The film has few of the greatest quotes that has not been used in films for decades.
5. Character development. I think this film is one of the very few films is DCU where a character has been built properly. It clearly portrays that a villain isn't always a superhero. It is an ordinary man who has been made villain by the oppression and loneliness of the society"

Amazing! Saw this 3 times,"Believe the 10 stars. It's that good. I really did go and see it 3 times (wouldn't it be great to have to upload your tickets to comment haha). So anyway, it's that good it proves that if something is that good you will spill money into it.The writing and performance is spectacular. The colours, camera work (so much beautiful art and passion went into this and you can tell). Joaquin puts in such an amazing performance that it doesn't feel like a performance, it feels like someone passionately believing in what He is starring in and not just here for the paycheck.The director, god bless you. You are a God among men, as the recent dross of the last decade you have reset the clock in movies and vindicated us the fans that Hollyweird is capable (when they stay hands off) of great art. So God bless you Todd Philips for fighting the industry for 2 years to bring this to screen and give us something so heartfelt.Everything about this movie is so spot on I really hope (if you havent) give it a chance. The 1 star shills should be ashamed. As should the Lame Stream MSM who were so wrong. I payed, yes PAYED to see this beautifull work of art 3 times, have bought the wonderfull vinyl soundtrack on (limited to 750 purple vinyl) & am awaiting the release of 4k steel book blu ray so I can watch this many more times.Hollywood take notice. People will invest money into things they LOVE."

What a relevant end to an absolutley horrifying decade (2010's).,"I rarely go to movies anymore because I think modern movies are hollow and nothing but reboots, sequels that are done to death, etc, but after I saw how much hate the ppl#x27;s and people were giving it and how it was apparently going to trigger an ""incel rebellion"" I just needed to check it out. The media HATED this movie and wanted it to fail, which is why this is one of the best movies in a long time. You know somethings amazing when the right people hate it.Arthur Fleck is a man who is disabled, bullied, and constantly shat on by society. Out of a job and taking care of his mother things take a turn for the worse. After seeing how crazy America is getting with wealth inequality, the militarization of police, super-rats, he has taken the black pill and realizes that nothing else matters in such a cruel and insane society. Arthur has had enough and becomes a celebrity that modern America deserves.This movie and it's themes of mental illness and childhood abuse reminded me a lot of Natural Born Killers which was released 25 years ago in 1994. In that movie, Bonny and Clyde characters Mickey & Mallory Knox have both been abused by their parents as well as having mental issues, decide to go on killing spree that makes headlines.I wasn't expecting this movie to have a lot of action but it didn't need it. Every minute is just as grungy, morose, and depressing as the one that comes after it. The atmosphere is so incredibly dark and hopeless which meshes perfectly with the gritty subject matter. This is in total contrast to 2008's Joker which was packed with action and was more of a good vs evil tale.The dialog is amazing. The acting is amazing. The music is amazing. Everything about this movie is top-tier.I never even knew Todd Phillips directed it until I saw his name on it and then the realization hit me. This is the same man who started off his career with a documentary movie on legendary shock-punk rocker GG Allin called ""Hated"". If anyone hasn't seen that I recommend you do as well as it shows the making of a legend.In conclusion, I think this movie perfectly encapsulates the state of modern western society. That on which is decaying and on it's last legs. Arthur becomes the norm."

Well then don't watch if you're one of those people.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Rewrote my review after the 4th watch of Joker - I've liked jokers before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved... a Joker! Here is why:","Someone said to me that Arthur Fleck chooses to burn the world he's not adapted to, and I answered her: it wasn't a choice. It was an escape, his only true option towards earning some satisfaction, opposed to endless misery he was constantly living in. Arthur never had any joy, or at least some degree of vindication of any kind in ""the normal world"", as this normal world battered and beleaguered him at every turn, putting him down repeatedly as that would be his place. Did he lash out? No, he got up like a good boy, over and over again, dozens of times just to be thrown down again. Until one day, he fought back, surprising himself he could do it! And what do you know? It worked! Shocked by the outcome, he tried again the worlds way, the kind and tolerant way, and the world has again made fun of him, and thus leaving him with the only option that makes him feel something besides it, the only option that works: to fight back, realizing that ultimately the only way you could have some satisfaction in this up world if you are Arthur Fleck, is to rebel against it! And that's funny, especially when you've been such a good boy, trying to do good by everyone! This is the true final paradox, the realization that the answer hit you in the face and you didn't see it all along, and this fact makes him think his life is an actual comedy rather than a tragedy. As I said in my few words of my previous review, the only way The Joker could be the hero is if he would somehow be able to make everyone else seem like the villains! And for the very 1st time, in this majestic masterpiece called Joker, he vilifies the whole society, and from a certain point of view arising the need for it to burn!Of course his life is one of tragedy, one of the cruelest imaginable. The very distance between perpetual humiliation and the choice to fight back being so tiny, but in the same time his inability to see it for so long is what constitutes the final paradox, almost making it sound like a comedy. Throughout the movie he cries while laughing or laughs while crying, but that's not the initial paradox. The initial paradox (reason) is easily spotted by anyone with deep enough empathy: when our human nature isn't able to handle the troubles anymore, pain seems unstoppable and the overflow of negative emotions is handled in opposing fashion. When the more you try, the worse it gets, you have 2 options: either you give up completely and kill yourself or although it hurts, you just laugh it out, you spit fate right in it's face! Arthur has lived this particular emotional paradox way before the action in the movie begins, because living it so many times before, by the time the movie starts the paradox is already part of his conscience, it's already a pathology, that's why when he's feeling unexpectedly sad or edgy, he's sent back in his mind to the paradox, to the uncontrolled laughter. That being the former reason for his behavior, the later being his whole life was a lie, from his detrimental mother to his submissive behavior; once cured from both, he could free himself from the decades of suffering also. The final paradox being the inconceivable: the fight against society bringing him vindication, instead of obvious defeat! Here is where our Joker differs from all of the villains of literature or classical culture, you can't pick a fight with society and win! Well, as it turns out... you can, if you're Joaquin Phoenix! Even his name is somewhat predestined for this, he was a good actor with an accomplished career but nobody had the nerve to call him genius before. And when everyone has forgotten about him, expecting him to die and be buried as an actor that will never know greatness, he arises and slams the door over your face with this Joker! And now, nobody can call him less than a genius, not even those who's brains aren't skilled enough to appreciate the movie.So this is the initial paradox described in detail: you try to do right by your workplace - you're rewarded with laughter and abuse, you try to do a good thing in a buss - you're rewarded with insult and affront, you take good care of your mother, you go to (the super fun) work to provide for her, you wash her, you cook for her, you speak nice to her and listen to her - you find out she abused you when you were a boy without even knowing, that she's crazy, and the ultimate buffer reward of all: she's not even your mother! Notwithstanding the fact you're having a romance with the attractive colored neighbor that lives down the hall, that supposedly can carry you through the rough times, just to be again rewarded with the stupefyingly truth: SUPRISE, IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD! (I lost it there.) There's no way that you wouldn't ultimately laugh at the merit that's completely at odds with the reward given, without fu.king exception! It's way over the stage of complete sadness, it's complete madness, it doesn't make sense, and what do you do when something intense felt doesn't make sense? You laugh. You go back and forth between tragedy and comedy like it's a roller coaster, a confusion trip from which there's no escape! It's no rational confusion, there's nothing wrong with Arthur's reason, it's an emotional confusion, 2 opposite feelings experienced in the same time! If we accept as common practice that we can cry out of sadness, sometimes even out of joy, Arthur teaches us that under extraordinary duress, prolonged indefinitely, one can laugh out of sadness. Moreover so, you can develop a pathology in this regard. What he feels in the moment he realizes everything is a lie is the most choking emotion possible, when you're at your utmost end of your mental supplies, fallen past the edge. I have never quite seen that so well described as in this movie! Arthur's reason is never impaired, no matter how strong negative emotions, they never quite conquer his reason but flow in sink with it, as such, the radical difference between those who kill themselves and him is that he realizes that he still has value, even if nobody notices it, not even his own mother ""Aren't you supposed to be funny, to be a comedian?"". But real or not, he believes ""People are starting to notice!"", even though he is contradicted by the gross reality of his failed stand up comedy. Oddly enough, he's not completely wrong as that sentence starts becoming reality just after he's left without anything more to lose, and forced to act as much as he can in his own defence, as nobody else does! Masterpiece. Need I say more? No problem.Just because he's left better off at the end of this movie than at it's beginning, doesn't mean we're gonna see a happy Joker in Joker 2! Not by a long shot, but strictly comparing him with his Joker one torment, I think he will be considerably better. I am surprised the creator of this movie, being one and the same, has actually decided to make a sequel! No matter how much money you receive from the producer company, to my mind, I can't possibly imagine how you could write a continuation, without tarnishing Arthur's personality shown in Joker 1. You can't turn him directly 150 degrees (considering 30 degrees he's already turned at the end of the 1st movie), a proper solid turn must be made, time and character consuming, because as we should know by now, Arthur cares a lot about ""nobody's people"" that have decency and compassion, even if he doesn't realize it, like he was until just recently, like the dwarf guy is and Arthur kissed him fatherly over his baldness showing his emotions of appreciation ""You're the only one who's ever been kind to me!"", making it blatantly obvious he does not ignore kindness in people. As opposite to what he shots his gun at! Occasionally dips his scissors in. (I like that Jackie Chan moment there, you can use any household item as a weapon - Kung Fu, right?) Joking aside, Arthur's morals are strong and the most obvious when he shouts his heart out on Gotham television ""Nobody thinks how it's to be the other guy!"", motto that in my opinion is the very center of his character! But that doesn't fit one bit with the classic Joker of the comic books or Nolan's Joker from The Dark Knight, it's a totally new approach of a Joker! That's why I love him. And those who think that motto is a joke, deserve more than just a bullet through their infectious thoughts, they would get off too easy! Because they are left way behind on the chapter of emotional inferno and need to be compensated accordingly, in order to understand what's it like! One of them being the rich mayor to be as he calls all of those trapped in this inferno as ""Nothing but clowns!"". But he gets what's coming to him, although a bit more pain wouldn't have hurt rather than complete oblivion that doesn't do him any good, aside from rising later on The Dark Knight. Back to Arthur and his live performance, nobody would have even cared what he shouted on that podium with all his might, if he wouldn't have made a clear point at the end, pointing out who's mean, why and what's coming to them mean ones, exemplified plenty and without any doubt! If he wouldn't have, they would have just thrown him out in the street like a piece of garbage and his words with him.I want to say that another impressive feature is that this movie despite it's visceral drama also has cool comedy in it, some obvious, some noticed at later viewing and exemplify them but I'm running out of character space(..) In conclusion, in my 1st review I said that the scenery is just good enough, but after seeing the movie 4 times I realized just how brilliant it is! Combined with one of the best performances of an actor in the history of cinematography and a sound theme that make your eyes fall off right between your tears, it can't be denied as one of humanity's all time masterpieces. When or if alien races will ever contact us, there's ample reason we are a worthy race, just like Arthur and this movie is my proof towards our humanity's worth."
Am I a joker sympathiser? Yes.,"This is a standalone film for The Joker, to understand his character and really identify with his personality! welcome to the beginning of the end! The film compells you to believe the joker can justify his crimes! That one man does have the power to take down those who abuse their so called "" higher social status""A man whose childhood has been subjected to acts of Evil, and has continued to suffer more subtly throughout his adult life, we as the audience must believe he is out to force that evil upon the world! So that they too, know for a moment, what's it's like to be the victim! This is his reasoning! A coming of age depicts a character created out of pure Evil. A society which has failed to recognise and listen, a society where everything is seen as a product. A society which divides people and forces entertainment to be at the heart of people's lives, sacrificing the expense of another's misery along the way. Anyone with a heart will feel empathy and understanding towards the Joker.Batman is one of my favourite characters, becuase his abilities are not overly far-fetched, and the sense of what could be real is far more believable than having the ability to fly! But truthfully their would be NO BATMAN without the joker.And here you have Joaquin Phoenix portraying the joker in a light never seen before! His performance is remarkable, diverse, captivating and emotional!Honestly, this is the best acting performance I have ever seen, regardless of genre, since solo performances from the likes of Kevin Spacey.I am grateful to be one of the first to have witnessed such a powerful performance in the cinema on it's initial release date! And will continue to discuss this film, whenever the topic of greatest movies/ acting performances arise!Generations after generations after generations, this film should be considered as framework for Drama/Media/ filming students and people whom want to pursue an acting career.Joaquin Phoenix you are a legend! This was a masterclass performance and you deserve all the fame and glory at all the award ceremonies!"

The Irishman is less Scorsese than The Joker?,"Picture a world where Taxi Driver meets DC. Honestly, this movie is the closest I've seen to a 10/10 in recent years.WARNING: Do not watch this expecting to see another Dark Knight or Batman Vs Sup! This film is closer to a Scorsese/OldNolan film than a blockbuster film. This is an entirely new take on the Joker so quit comparing it to Ledgers Joker.With a budget of 50 Million dollars, Phillips manages to pull off a phsyc-thriller film set in the 70s with actor Joequin Phoenix as the lead role of Arthur Fleck, the Joker.Phoenix in this movie is truly convincing. The music puts the audience in Arthurs head and the cinematography is superb! Costume design is great with everything in this movie being convincing and complex, yet not complicated enough to lose the audience.This is a must watch movie with many twists and turns, being in the head of Arthur Fleck is an incredibly unique take on mental illness. With scenes questioning and evaluating your own choices in life against other people , which is what every legendary film has managed to achieve.You will definitely not leave the theatres glistening with a joyful smile as if you watched the sun rise, but you will still be satesfied like every reviewer so far. The lowest of ratings will at least say ""You won't regret it""P.s' people giving this movie bad reviews have:Compared it to The Dark KnightA Slow attention span (prefer movies with Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson, and transformers, Shaw and Hobbs)Come in the theatres Super hyped (Sorry)Been paid to give bad reviews"

Phoenix is phenomenal,"As an avid DC fan, I have been waiting so long to see this film and last night, I finally did. After all the hype, I was sceptical as to whether or not it would actually meet its potential.
It's safe to say that it scored well above and beyond anything I imagined.
Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. His acting feels very raw; such a troubled character who's played so beautifully. Whilst you will always get the comparative question of ""who's better? Ledger or Phoenix?"" I argue that the two explore completely different stages in the Joker's life and thus are utterly incomparable. Phoenix's performance did not feel like a performance, more-so an observation into the life of a man who I truly felt devastatingly sorry for. His actions of violence seemed like the right thing to do and I almost agreed with the murderous actions he inflicted. Marvel, eat your heart out.

Thank you for making this film, it's like living at the same time as Da Vinci or Michelangelo, and getting to witness virtuoso genius front row. I'm blown away.
Amazing seamless character development. I can't , I'm worried to try to put this in words and categorize it.

Went in 4 Weeks after its release day.,"At the moment WB announce Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker I was smiling cause I knew this can't flop. Joaquin is a fabulous actor. I was keen to see him portraying my favorite villain and I think The Joker is the most known and impressive villain ever made.Notes to the people that telling you it's not worth it: Well that's the same people that believes 96 Hours is the best movie they ever seen. They have a limit in taste of movies. Jokes aside don't let them distract you when they say there is no action and clear storyline. It's a drama movie not a highflying stunt movie.I love the atmosphere and the motions Todd Phillips created. This feels so authentic and convincing. As a Batman fan I knew how the Joker the character itself was buildup and the movie catches more viewers who never had watched a Batman movie or read a comic book. Several brillant actor played Joker in their own way and I really don't like people saying: Every Joker portraying was trash, but Heath Ledgers was perfect. The thing is the other Jokers we've seen in the Batman movies were the character already became the movie doesn't show how things made him become The Joker. An advantage for this movie of course !The movie has a strong message for people with mental disease and how much impact humanity and respect for each other has on a person. The movie wouldn't be successful if it wasn't about a DC character.My review might be awful but I'm speechless to go more in detail.Joaquins acting was outstanding. He really made me think he's a psycho. Such a good acting. I wonder what his secrets are for preparing for this role. I wonder how he acted off screen at the set.I really hope this movie gets an Oscar since this is the only top movie of the year I have seen I think the chance is very high."

Finally. Beautiful film is back.,"The most empathetic spiral into a rage fuelled desire to belong in a realistic, cruel but not-so-dissimilar to reality kind of way. Almost a psychological expose on how home grown terrorists feel and are made; how kids end up shooting up schools. This is how. Bullying, ostracism, falling through the cracks of society and extreme disparities in class and privilege lead to the breakdown of society. Brilliantly told and acted, it was reminiscent of Hong Kong's demonstrations (masks and rebellion against power authorities), Escobar-like villainous anti-establishment virtue with a V-for-Vendetta flavour. The best film I've seen in a long time. Didn't think Heath could be outdone but it was. Here's to hoping the Batman franchise is reborn with the same realism and darkness thats always been a tad missing, even under Nolan's direction. This is adult, gritty, real comic which has deeper comments on society and needs to be the new standard in comic based film. Logan (Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine) comes a distant second after Joker.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Never judge a book by its cover!,"I was seriously not interested in that movie after watching some clowns roaming about in the trailer - I'm getting tired of the redundant Purge movies' characters, you know ; and I'm not enjoying the new trend of blurring the lines between good and evil (e.g. Maleficent, 2019). I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when some friends opted for watching it, and I was baffled!The movie was nothing I had expected it to be. It is actually what a Joker backstory should be like. It is believable, intriguing and down to earth. It is really what you can call an adaptation. Todd Phillips manages to make you feel the darkness in Gotham and how it roves through the city in search of the next victim. The whole Batman universe is thus successfully explained. And Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in the role of the Joker.This movie is not really for the usual Batman fan in search of fantasy, fight scenes and high-tech accessories, but for the pragmatic moviegoers who can enjoy watching a masterpiece just like others enjoy French cuisine in a 5-starred restaurant - I'm not kidding! Great job!"

What a movie...,"Joker actually is a mix of different genres and elements who create something unique.

I think it's the best character development I've see in a movie and the screenplay it's artistic written. Even if doesn't follow the comic mythology at all and it's very realistic and less comic book movie, Joker has a lot of elements of Batman Mythology and gives some hint to DC fans.

Instant classic,"This is the best film I've seen in years and best acting (from Phoenix). It is a very carefully crafted film and it's clear that everyone who worked on it loved this project.
For the entirety of the film I forgot about my surroundings forgot that I was sitting in the movie theatre. I felt like I was living Arthur's life or that I'm watching him up close in person.
Phoenix is a true artist and the whole cast and crew should be VERY, AWFULLY proud of what they've given birth to. I applaud them. (Don't miss this film! Go and see it NOW!)4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Finally competition for Ledger?,"A symphonic love letter to fans of the infamous Batman antagonist, the Joker.Don't expect this film to be a day in the life of the character however; as the films purpose it to show the *almost* gradually declining mental state of an extremely troubled Arthur Fleck as he sees his life crumbling around him as his eyes open to the dull and unforgiving environment of Gotham City.Overall a great film with a stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joker of the year,"Considering I am not big on violence and the Batman series plus my boyfriend dragged me along to watch this, it was a great movie which portrayed Arthur developing into his persona as Joker. You feel for Arthur and empathise with his life story until his craziness goes out of control. Dark yet so relevant - spooked that I may know a few people like joker.... kidding.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Did not expect this to be so good,"I was very skeptical going into this, especially after being scarred for life with Jared Leto's Joker (ugh)..in my eyes no body could beat Heath Ledger's Joker...I must say though - Joaquin did an excellent job! This Joker to me was very deep, it showed more of the mentally ill side of the Joker rather than a crazy criminal mastermind, which he did a great job at capturing that vibe.

Long time no see,"Movies been dead to me long time until this came up. I bet this movie will keep ringing a bell in years to come as it strikes the core conflict of western world cultural issue which rooted from the structure of the society which is to worship so-called property gaining success instead of moral value champions. Individuals are so detached intentionally by design to perpetuate the poor keep being poor and rich keep being rich. Self-endeavor will not matter. To success, you fight. Why? The system has been designed this way. Until at times, the people fed up, the people say enough is enough. And here is the ""Joker"".4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"A Unforgettable, Profound, Deeply Moving Masterpiece","This movie was simply beautiful, a masterpiece for all time. I think the reason why so many of us feel pity and - yes - sympathy for Arthur is because to one extent or another we have all experienced tragic moments and sorrow like he has, but we were able to pull out of our dark moments. Unfortunately, he never did.It is a truly realistic portrayal of how a cruel society can send essentially good person into the darkest depths of madness. The movie will not once let your mind drift into distraction as it is mesmerizing and fascinating from the very beginning to the very last moment. Despite the violence, you cannot help but feel for Arthur Fleck - Joaquin Phoenix's character - and may actually root for him, cheering him on in the hope that somehow everything will eventually lead to some form of happy ending for him. You'll have to see the movie to find out if it does.As for the movie reviews, some have been entirely unfair and biased for some strange reason I cannot fathom. One critic from a well known New York publication (btw, I'm from NY, too) criticized it for not being ""fun,"" which makes it absolutely clear that guy has no idea what this movie is about and should probably dedicate himself to something else. If someone is out to see a ""fun"" movie, this masterpiece is not for you. As someone said in another review below, other movies are like going to eat a hamburger; this is more like a $1,000 steak. Fortunately, the success of movies by and large do not depend on film critics but rather on the general public and what we think about them.Regarding the references to Heath Ledger, with all due respect, it's like comparing apples and oranges. I saw his performance, and it was decent for entertainment purposes. But Joaquin Phoenix's performance is simply breathtaking and perhaps unlike anything ever seen before in movie history; Joaquin Phoenix descends into actual madness before our very eyes. He takes us an a journey through the human mind, with moments of light and moments of sad and disconcerting darkness, all while winning over the audience and getting it on his side. It's a depiction of life that we can all relate to in one way or another, which is why his performance is so unique.In terms of movie directing, Todd Phillips needs to be given credit, as he should be for offering us such a masterpiece. I'm sure it will mark and change his directing career.Finally, this is a movie I will see again, and again, and again to the end of my days. My former favorite movie of all time was Planet of the Apes (1968) because it had a deep message about the world and society, one I could relate to even though I was born years later. I think 'Joker' will replace it because it has touched me so deeply. I will simply say it had such an impact on me that I couldn't help but get emotional more than once."

"Masterful, dark, shocking, and strong. An incomparable work, the film of the year.","Joker is a unique, raw and special movie. It is a violent story that shows us the slow descent into madness of our protagonist, Arthur. The movie was incredibly hyped to what runs the year, however, unlike what usually happens with many movies that cause such excitement, this achievement exceed any expectation. This is a movie that definitely deserves any possible ovation to her. An incredible job. It seems fantastic to me to know that the director was able to carry out a work of such quality that it will simply become a milestone in the years to come; it is a unique story, without censorship which shows us the development of a protagonist in such a fluid, effective and fascinating way that we can come to sympathize with such madness, a violent madness, raw and emotional. These words can describe the essence of this film, capable of transmitting ideas and sensations of extreme power and power that nothing can equal.Much has been said about Joaquin's performance, and here I come to repeat the same thing, because he simply deserves it: It's incredible, it's perfect. This is the Joker that is capable of existing in this world, a performance as strong as human, a cruel and realistic touch gives enough support for us to understand the motivations of the character, who is not only a villain with a goal, or an idea, it is the explosion caused by the spark of madness. The acting is just sublime, and I'll say it at once; it's time for his Oscar.Incredible, fantastically dark, every minute of this film is a work of pure passion, effort and attention to detail, you can more than notice the incredible work that has been put into it. Everything is simply fascinating, the direction, the incredible script, the beautiful cinematography, the masterful performance, the deep soundtrack, the emotional scenes, the fluid development, and so on.Joker is a masterpiece. Psychological, powerful, crazy."

Phoenix=Brilliant,"Went into this movie not knowing what to expect. The hype surrounding it was overwhelming but it lived up to it. Brilliant case study surrounding Arthur Fleck's transition into the joker. What separates this from other superhero/villain movies is there is no suspension of disbelief. Every event and action could have plausibly taken place and that's what's so chilling about the movie. It really causes one to sit back and reflect on the nature of our society in creating the situations in the movie. Acting was brilliant, on par with Ledger.

"Awesome, mesmerising, masterclass in acting.","Wow, in the words of the song, I wasn't expecting that!I thought it would be like Batman but there is nothing comic book about this!I'm a mental health crisis nurse with 21 years experience and I'm sad to say that this is a true reflection of community care as a result of years of the Tory regime.We used to have case study videos at Uni but this tops them all.It is the perfect portrayal of a man with antisocial personality disorder who is consistently let down by the system and slips through the net with disastrous consequences.Everything about this film is genius.Mr Phoenix, words fail me, apart from he is one magnificently gifted individual. A breathtaking performance.The film is very very dark, very very depressing but so gripping and engaging.Ignore the hype about people walking out and the glorification of violence, it's nonsense. Watch the average horror movie and that will be much more bloody and violent than this and if anyone were to wear a clown's mask and try to copy then they are seriously in need of help.Don't watch this if you're expecting a typical comic book film, but if you're after an adult, mature and true to life character depiction, then watch this.Awesome."
Joker is gonna mess with your mind!,"Easily became my favorite film of all time. When it was first announced that Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Joker a was a bit sceptical. But his performance was the best ever! Suited him perfectly with a great origin story movie for a villain. This is a story of how a man goes completely mad so if you expect to see full on savage Joker early on try to focus on Arthur Fleck and how his psychology changes with every punch he takes from society which is actually affects you as well. Todd Philips did a brilliant job, every shot of the film was breathtaking for me. Especially that first scene of Arthur with clown make up in the bathroom dancing.

Joaquin was responsible for making this character.. so believably believable! His ability, to become the Joker, left me in awe of his acting. I was laughing and wondered if I should have been at certain points. Joaquin guided me into that warped mind and you understood the why. Loved it.

Why you should absolutely see this movie,"I Was not expecting this movie to be such a masterpiece at every single level. It is truly what a movie should be: transporting you in the psyche of someone that is not you and make you relate to this person in some strange way. I'm speechless by how incredible it was, how I was taken by surprise...
We knew Phoenix to be a great actor for twisted vilain since Gladiator , but now it is going to be impossible to imagine the Joker without him playing it.
There is such depth in his acting, such a raw interpretation of mental illness. I'm just baffled how he is able to carry the movie and this level of intensity from the first minute to the last one on -almost- a stand alone performance. Very impressive performance that make some A list actors look like amateur who can only play themselves.
As an origin story for the joker, it brings so much depth to this DC character and thinking of the Joker now in previous Batman movie, make him become such an interesting vilain.As a final note, I loved how they twisted the birth of Batman and kept the previous work done with Batman begins coherent but slightly different.I thought before that DC was doing a poor job transposing their universe and character to the big screen (except for Batman Begins) but man, this movie changed my mind!
Congrats to all the team who work on making this move a reality, and a standing ovation to Mr Phoenix for granting us of such an acting performance.
Already a classic!"

"Critics, give me a break please.","Lately, most movies have been adapted to be ""friendly"" for most viewers, lacking of depth, darkness and other ingredients. People and critics specified that movies (specially Disney-action movies) had to sacrifice some darkness and/or reality in order to make them user friendly for most audiences.
Then comes The Joker. It ignores any aspect of the ""audience friendly"" scheme and jumps into reality, darkness and all these aspects that we were so desperetely waiting for in other movies. This movie is graphic and crude in a lot of senses but thats what makes it so perfect. Todd Phillips didnt try to make it fit for all audiences. However, I've sene a lot of critics out there ripping into this film for being fuel for other things and for the strong content shown. Please decide what is it that you want because if you are looking for movies that ""fit"" most audiences, then you should be looking at a different franchise.

It made the Joker more than a character but a believable being that could live down the street, ride your bus, or work in your city. You travel with him down a dark hole until he reaches the point you'd expect in this scenario, yet still I found it unpredictable. This is a must see for any fan and truly the best Joker there has ever been.

"Dark, Deep, Moving, and a Psychological Masterpiece","As a student of psychology, Joker has found a way to see the slow decay of a individual suffering from psychosis, psychotic tendencies, narcissism, the need to belong, and finding pleasure in the darkest of places.
This movie isn't for everyone. It is very dark. There isn't a happy ending. Yet the acting and story-line can be appreciated for the moving story it portrays. As the Joker portrays one with a severe mental illness, this movie at least offers insight on the real struggles that exist in those with mental health problems, while still offering a masterful way to depict the origin story of the world's greatest super villain.

Proof that comedic directors can make real films,"This film is magnificent. It is disturbing, suspenseful and original- from the same director as the ""Hangover"" movies. Todd Phillips proves his cinematic skill with this dark and provoking thriller/character study. From the retro Warner Bros. logo at the beginning to the vintage ""The End"" title card at the chilling conclusion, ""Joker"" will no doubt affect the viewer in one way or another. Of course, it would be absurd to not attribute part of this film's excellence to Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance. One half terrifying, one half sympathy-evoking, and 100% believable, Phoenix delivers more than the audience could have ever asked for. The entire film is cemented by the eerie soundtrack, composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir. This Joker is unlike any of its predecessors, and will likely remain unrivalled for years to come.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Temper your expectations!,"If you come into this movie with MCU expectations this will be a difficult watch for you. There's a certain level of fantasy that has been excepted as norm in modern day comic book films. Joker flips that on its head. It's real, and I mean really real! It deals with some very deep themes that are uncomfortable to deal with but I think that's the point, it's a mirror of our society. This is not some special effects laden anti-hero flick, rather, this is a character study of the devolution of a man that society has failed on every level.

Wow. Joker was executed perfectly,"If there was a way to tell a story of a mad man who is the mortal enemy of Gotham's Dark Knight... This was it.

Woooow,"Never would I had thought I'd sympathize and even feel sorry for the man that would become the joker. Heartbreaking, unsettling, disturbing, pity, remorse. I felt all that throughout the film as I kept rooting for Arthur to find happiness even if I knew the end result. You don't need to be a batman or comic fan to appreciate this movie.And forget the media for focusing so much on how this ""glorifies"" violence. It wasn't even that violent. There are bigger issues it raises like rich vs poor, mental/physical abuse, and of course, mental illness. I left thinking on all those, in fact feeling more sympathetic for those like Arthur. And I'm sure there are ppl out there struggling like him, even without the mental baggage. The media should be praising this film.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
IT'S NO JOKE.,"The best thing about this movie is how we see the world through Arther Fleck's eyes (who will transform psychologically to become Joker) and not through a narrator's perspective. That alone makes this movie so unique coz it's the first time that is done with a character that is so villainous and so popular like Joker.
No need to speak about how great Joaquin Phoenix's performance is. It's an Oscar worthy in my opinion. It's so hard - if not impossible to top him this year.
The director did a tremendous job to deliver the darkness and grittiness of Gotham City in a deep touching way. That makes you get sucked into that world. Photography is another spectacular aspect of this movie.

Joker is a masterpiece,"Intense, unnerving film that caused real dialogue between myself and the person I saw the film with. Don't quite understand the controversy surrounding it and I admit it won't be a film that everyone will love (has a pace that some may consider slow). Really interesting character study that Phoenix absolutely nails. I understand it won't happen, but would love to see more Gotham villains get this type of standalone origin film treatment.

Joker - The honest human review,"I will attempt to provide a spoiler free opinion.. here it is.Joker is for all intents and purposea a masterpiece. I went in with very high expectations but I was not prepared for this.
In the past years I saw msnu PC movies, superhero movies and overall movies without soul that were vrry highly regarded, but this one here has all I was missing.
Cinematography is exceptional, I saw at least 4-5 scenes that were absolutly suberb, in acting and imaging. Those type of scenes that you rembember and have goosebumps over.
Sound, while not the best or memorable (at least not at first watch) as were The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream and others, it is still top notch and more important were perfectly match with what I was seeing.
Last and clearly not least, Joaquin Pheonix....I read and seen quite a bit before going in ""ohhh people are walking out of the movie or it is bad...not PC enough, apolitical. ...etc"" all those messages are from critics that honestly follow a crooked agenda. My truth is I saw acting like I did not see for a loooong time. The descent inyo madness is palpable, relatable and real. Mr. Pheonix is incredible, suberb, breathtaking! An Oscar performance and while I gave it a 10 to counter this lowlifes agenda spewers the movie is a strong 9.Go watch this, I am sure you will have a great experience. One of the few movies that deserves your money and time"
It's not the Joker you know but the movie is brilliant,"Hold right there. And drop all your superheroes preconceptions. This is not a summer dumb fun action super villain movie. It's something else.A reinterpretation of Joker. And it's harrowing in its grittiness and potential. You will be there in the streets of Gotham, a Gotham that feels more real than any other fictional city on screen. Because little does it matter where the events happen on screen. This Joker can be anyone, anywhere.A perfect score in movie means more than just a great story. For me it means the character, the performance, the build-up. And all of them are beautifully done. Especially the build-up. Maybe some will think it's too slow, but I was glued to the screen the whole time.Of course, I still have some complaints, but most of them are because of my view on the Joker. As the classic Joker, I think Heath Ledger is still the best but he was helped by the script. The Joker's background should not be known, that's what makes the character so unpredictable.But Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is the people's hero, a deranged hero for a deranged society."
"Joker Is Impactful: Dark, Tense and Profoundly Sad","Joker was one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time: dark, tense and profoundly sad. I spent the bulk of my time while watching this film either on the edge of tears or in a state of pre-panic. The cinematography was gorgeous, the soundtrack amazing, and the acting was award-worthy.

The Taxi Driver of Comicbook Movies,"Joker is a Taxi Driver type moment for the Comicbook movie genre its just as nuanced just as controversial and just as dark, violent and dirty as Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece, it also has deep deep threads linking it to a whole host of other mid to late 70's and early 80's classics like Friedkins The French Connection or another Scorsese classic The King Of Comedy its abit on the nose with some of its influences but it never takes away from the overall originality of Phoenix's performance or the movie in general it feels more like Todd Phillips paying respects to a wonderfully provocative and risky era in filmmaking, Todd Phillips is really masterful and mature with the camera here his direction is steady when needed and slightly more chaotic in chase sequences like William Friedkin with his chase scenes in The French Connection, Phillip's use of the close up here is much appreciated to so you can see and feel every facset of what is an absolutely riveting performance from Joaquin Phoenix he channels so much energy into Arthur so much so Phoenix vanishes for 2 hours and it's only when the credits role you realise he was acting its astonishing work well worthy of an Oscar nomination if not a win although knowing the hacks over at the Academy they will no doubt buckle under the pressure of media outrage and deny him. From the powerful score by Hildur Guðnadóttir to the wonderfully framed and gorgeous Cinematography by Lawrence Sher Joker is a rare treat not often seen in cinema today yet alone in the Comicbook movie genre it's a fantastic movie and it should be seen by as many people as possible so we can get more challenging and nuanced films in what is such a rich and deep universe. Joker is The Taxi Driver of the Comicbook Movie its bold, dark and controversial and we need more movies like it. 10/10 A Masterpiece."

Best Movie of the Year,"There are many things that can be said about this movie, and going in there was a lot of talk about social commentary and how the movie will spark a violent event, but not one thing came across as something trying to trigger someone into acting out against society. It's just a movie, and a great one at that. I don't need people deciding my morals and movies don't either, it's just for entertainment, and this just that, but in a very uncomfortable way. I have never seen someone carry a movie in such a way that Joaquin Phoenix did. The way he moved, the way he held himself, to the way he contorts his body in an visibly painful way. It just screams commitment and pure talent. I just wish it wasn't a standalone film. The violence and gore in the movie is only in like 4 scenes but with such surprise and effect that those few scenes are burned into your memory. Robert Dinero gave a wonderful take on being a daily night time show host, and really is the best performance in a long time for him. This movie was truly uncomfortable, emotional, and really showed every layer of joker that really was never shown before. Every part of the movie slowly progressed Arthur Fleck into the joker, and if any part was removed, then the joker wouldn't have made any sense. It just shows how perfectly done the character arch of Joker was. I don't think there will ever be a movie with such respect to detail to the chain of events that led to his final form as Joker."
"A Chilling Ballet of Mental Illness, That Dances Between Life's Tragedies","The Joker is not a comic book movie, but rather a master class in character study. The film follows your lead Arthur Fleck or ""The Joker"". You're told the story through his eyes, and through this lens it is easy to find Arthur extremely sympathetic. Jaoquin Phoenix's portrayal, coupled with Todd Phillip's writing had made for a character who holds onto your attention the whole film. There wasn't a moment of the film I wasn't in awe, when the score would slowly creep in to give you chills over a scene that was previously completely silent, or still shots of hallways, and stair cases as Arthur is alone in frame, just to give you a gripping sense of loneliness throughout the film. Though the plot can be fairly predictable, it's how those moments play out that are surprising. You feel like you know something will happen one way and it does happen never in the way you feel it will though. The script can often times be dull for some, but to me I saw these moments as cold, hard bits that look into Arthur's psychy. Like a scene in which Arthur is in a comedy club and doesn't get what's funny and what's not so he just laughs, none of the jokes are really funny, but they're supposed to be things we know are supposed to be funny so we see that Arthur doesn't understand. There are other jokes that aren't laugh out loud hilarious, but are just funny enough to get you to think they are, and then immediately, a like of dialogue comes in to make you feel bad about laughing about that.The best things I can say about this film can't be said without spoiling it, all I can say is that it is a cold, gritty horror film about the horrors of the human psyche that'll leave you uncomfortable towards the end, with many questions about yourself left in your head after just one viewing."

A MASTERPIECE,"This is the movie of the year if not the decade! A masterful directing from Todd Phillips, the photography, the music are also outstanding.
But what is breathtaking, is Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. He has been an outstanding actor worth at least an Oscar already (for The Gladiator, The Master, Inherent Vice and so on). But his Joker will be taught in film schools. You don't see such a performance too often or never see one.
On the other hand, about the film, it's a standalone movie but if you know the Batman Universe you understand small details better.

Send in the clowns.,"Thanks to it premiering on the festival circuit and all of the recent discourse surrounding its content, Joker is a film that feels as if it has been out for ages when in fact it's only just been released this weekend. My anticipation for its release was already sky-high but had only been heightened by the media claiming it to be a dangerous film to release to the public and the rise in security presence at recent premiere screenings in America however, does the film even deserve all the discourse it's seen before its release?Having been disregarded by society, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown-for-hire, descends into a life of crime and infamy.There's a deeply unsettling sense of impending violence that flows throughout Joker from start to finish, Arthur's descent towards a life of crime depicted in incredibly visceral fashion. It's a ticking time-bomb of a film that hones in on the mental state of its titular character and how he's viewed by society, Todd Phillips and Scott Silver not holding back in making Gotham a horrible place for Arthur to reside.The production design ensures Gotham feels very much a character playing a part in Arthur's downward spiral, as does Lawrence Sher's glum cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's minimal yet rather haunting score.Joker is elevated to great heights by a mesmerisingly magnetic lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who yet again showcases why he is arguably the best actor working today with a performance for the ages. It's such a devastatingly beautiful performance that's both hard to watch at times yet hard to take your eyes off, Phoenix surely the man to beat come awards season.He's certainly the main attraction on show in Joker but he's dealt some stellar support from the likes of Robert De Niro, embracing the cheesy flair of his character, and Zazie Beetz, offering Arthur a glimmer of hope in his otherwise downbeat life.Joker really is a stunning character study from Todd Phillips, unflinching in its approach and deeply unsettling in its execution, the performance from Joaquin Phoenix in particular making it a film that will certainly leave a lasting impression."

Masterpiece!!!,"First of all, please do not compare Joaquin Phoenix's Joker with Heath Ledger's Joker. We are lucky to see two actors playing a very difficult character of Joker brilliantly in their own ways. They are both so good, they are both legends!In terms of movie, Joker origin story is something very new and very much needed. It has always been emphasized in the DC world that Gotham was irredeemable, that the people were so corrupted that the city was beyond saving. But the reason behind it was never shown. The story has always been told from Batman's point of view. This storytelling is so brilliant, you really sympathize and understand why Joker is what it is. If you see Dark Knight just after this, Joker's love for chaos will make total sense.It's good to see such a realistic cinema with characters having so much depth. The level of acting and movie making is legendary. Hats off!Yes the hype is real. Do not miss this masterpiece."

My Quick review over the movie,"I watched Joker on IMAX yesterday sitting on the the best seats which means that I already known that this movie is gonna be amazing. How? Well, I watched the Master months ago which the only thing that in my eyes was well to watch, it was the Phoenix's acting in this movie.
This ensured me about his acting skills and his integrity as an actor that this movie is gonna be amazing. I was expecting something as good as this Joker, which it has honestly gone over my expectations. Firstly, Todd Phillips has done a masterpiece. Congratulations to him. He can boast anyone with this perfect directing of his. It is clear enough from the movie that he did not consent to any bad impression, any bad part that could be showing this movie as an ordinary film throughout the world. He targeted his efforts to create a perfect movie, to be a part of history. I believe he has achieved it already.
Secondly, the music of this movie just fits the mood and angles of the movie. This is one of the most important and common parts of any amazing movie. For Example, Interception would never be The Interception without Hans Zimmer making the music. Well in this movie, also I have seen great moves from a composer, which it definitely helped me to feel the emotions of such complex character (Joker), plot and the mood of each scene of the film. It is a well done composing by Hildur Guðnadóttir. She deserves some great awards for her art in this film.Thirdly, the script and plot of the story which makes the audience to be fully concentrated on the character of Joker and his feelings. It is more dramatic than a ""DC"" or a ""comic"" movie. This plot answers many questions about Joker's originality. The plot is amazing as well in which it keeps you guessing about the future scenes. Also, the fact that even after the film, it keeps you thinking about the theory after the ending and the moral of the story, makes this work of art, a special work of art.Fourthly, the coloring of the movie, the filmmaking, the screen display, the camera shots, the sounds, the special effect, the lighting and etc. All of them has don't the best they could do and make a stunning result. There is nothing say about them else than admiring the whole crew for bringing such an art to our eyes.
Lastly, The ACTING. For me, personally, I don't like a slow going plot. A smooth story telling plot is super boring for me. But, for this movie, the only and only thing that keeps me watching the movie without blinking is Joaquin Phoenix. His acting is just WOW! The most impressive thing about this movie, the most significant thing that make the movie, looks realistic is his indubitable, indisputably acting. His acting is phenomenal. For me it's just a question, HOW DID HE DO THAT??!! I can never act like that. It is super difficult to even understand the Joker's character. How did he act like that?! I believe This is his best roll ever, and one of the best actings ever. (At least in top 5) He deserves to get the best awards for his roll in this movie, and he is definitely comparable with Heath Ledger. His acting is full of emotions, filled with unreleased anger, full of simplicity and humanity, filled with oppression, his laughs are with meaning, his eyes are full of un dropped tears and his chest is full of unspoken words. He doesn't understand the people. He relies on their humanity, he trusts them and yet, he gets beaten by them, he gets betrayed and he gets suffocated. He has never found Love he always wanted. Everyone, disrespected him and manipulated him through his life. He has seen insincerity hurting him to his bones. And, when he gets to the top, when he finds his way to feel better, to be recognized, you can still see that he is confused and new to this stage of life. This is just perfect. One of the best actors of all time, I would name him.The moral of the movie is so deep and it is full of unfortunate and painful truths. It's an unreal but at the same time real tragedy.This movie can change a lot of people's mindset in different countries. If you have seen this film, please stop judging and discriminating other people. If you have not, you are missing a great masterpiece! Enjoy!"
One of the most gripping cinema experiences in years,"I was never overly hyped for this movie, though the expectations after seeing the first trailer were high. After seeing it at the opening day, it definitely surpassed any expectations I had. Yes, the title might be read and experienced as the Taxi Driver of 21st century. But at the same time it is much, much more. The best Joker movie that could have been made, dark, enthralling, moody, making you constantly uncomfortable. Great acting from Joaquin Phoenix, total embodiment of the loneliness, fragmentation and psychosis of the character and its slow turning into the clown prince of crime. By far the best movie based on comic book material and characters that has been ever made, surpassing what Nolan did in his trilogy. Though Ledger was great in the Dark Knight, the one that truly captures the essence and psychology of the Joker is this performance of Phoenix. A must seen movie, whereas the controversy around the themes of violence, anarchy and disputing of the existing order and paradigm in society should not be something that stops any true cinema lover from seeing this - go and experience for yourself a new landmark in the transfer of the comic books material to the medium of the 7th art. A true masterpiece of modern cinema."

Joaquin Deserves An Oscar For His Brilliant Performance,"Heath Ledger raised the bar with his Joker performance, but I knew that if anyone could nail this role it would be Joaquin Phoenix.
I saw Joker and I absolutely loved it! This movie does not have all the action packed scenes we are use to seeing, it focuses more on character and the genesis of the Joker.
Don't walk into the theater expecting and comparing him to Heath Ledger's performance, expect to see Joaquin Phoenix giving an Oscar worthy performance with his masterful take on it.
In yo face Marvel! As much as I enjoy the Marvel universe, in my personal opinion none of those actors can pull off a performance like Joaquin in Joker.
This movie proves that you don't need all the syfy and special effects to make a movie great, it has solid acting by a brilliant actor.
Doesn't look like he would do another one but it would be awesome if he did.
I love Phoenix and Deniro's chemistry together.

2019 Best Movie of the Year!,"This ain't an action movie or a super hero movie either. Do not expect Heath Ledger to act in this. Rest In Peace to the best Joker in the entire world. Joaquin Phoenix portrays as Arthur Fleck, suffering from a mental disorder and truly ridicule by the terror of Gotham City society. Seeing what he goes through in his life can really bring a man down to madness. Yes, the key word is madness! It's a prequel to the Dark Knight. In this movie we slowly seeing Arthur become Joker. Don't want to spoil it, because this is a character development movie. I will give Joaquin Phoenix credit as he becomes iconic clown prince of crime. Joker is the best movie of the year!4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Joaquin Phoenix IS the Joker!,"Regardless of what some of those ""artsy"" film critics might say. This film is an absolute gem. Joaquin Phoenix in my personal opinion SURPASSED the late great Heath Ledger as the clown prince of crime. Believe me, I was pro Ledger for years upon years & even went into this film believing that Phoenix wouldn't even come close to matching Ledger's performance but man, I was wrong on so many counts. Todd Phillips did a PHENOMENAL job with the direction of the film. Phillips was definitely not the guy you would have expected to make a such a dark, aggressive & disturbing film but he sure outdid himself. If both Phoenix & Phillips don't receive an Academy award for this film, everyone should riot in clown masks at the Oscars.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The reality is what's terrifying... I think,"It was heavy, spent most of the time with my hand over my mouth, and thinking about what I think about this movie. Seen so many disturbing stuff in films, people getting eaten alive in the worst ways by zombies, cannibalism, skinning, etc. yet this movie made someone getting shot and someone getting stabbed the maybe most disturbing thing I've ever witnessed. I have deduced because it was so real. The insanity expressed was so real, it left me so uncomfortable. Felt like DC let out their pent up rage towards Marvel... kinda kidding. But basically this movie deserves the revolutionary hype it's getting, and this is coming from someone who was skeptical of all the praise.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Just....wow!!!!,"Just came back from seeing this film and feel that my high expectations were exceeded. Joker is a rarity I feel. It is a commercial film that is taken from a comic book character but actually has something to say. It is by far the best DC film since Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy but it feels less like a comic book film than a character study. And it is. And yes I have read that it has been said that it borrows heavily from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy and it does in that it presents the Arthur Fleck character as a loner, outsider, mostly shunned by people around him just like Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin. It is definitely a film that follows that slow burn into insanity and violence like those films but it's not a bad thing.By now everyone knows that this film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur, and through the film we see his transformation into The Joker. It is an origin story. He plays Arthur as a thin, weak disturbed person who is treated badly by those around him. And he slowly grows to have truly disturbing thoughts and actions. The film is a comic book film in that it is about s character that comes from that medium but it is in no way a light film. Avengers Endgame this is not. And I revere that film but i think that it is great that they decided to not sugar coat this story and tried to go deeper and make it more about the psychology of the character as opposed to his criminal antics. That Todd Phillip's a comedy director took this on and did it with such success is stunning. I will avoid all.of thr controversy that has come from this film saying that it condones violence. It is violent and disturbing but in no way compares to other films that are much worse. I like that it went for an adult theme and is rated R. My kid will.not be seeing this anytime soon. Great film, great performance. Period.One last thing. I know that Phoenix's Joker is inevitably going to be pit against Heath Ledger's interpretation of the character. Some saying that this is better. I think that it is different, not better. Ledger was THE JOKER. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck becoming THE JOKER. The performances stand on their own as great but I still favor Ledger just a bit more. But not by alot."

Interesting how the mainstream media has had such a negative response to this,"I thought this was an incredible movie, and I'm shocked that mainstream reviews have been so negative. I personally think it's because of the social commentary that's so pervasive throughout it. I read one review from NBC I think that said this movie had no point or substance, which of course anyone who's watched it would know is total b.s. They aren't stupid; they know that this was a critique of the elite (among other things). You had sympathy for him, while still being incredibly uncomfortable watching it.
This movie was very intense and disturbing. There was nothing entertaining about it. It kept me up most of the night. Everything about it was well-done, and it's unfortunate it isn't getting the response it should from film critics, but again, I think we all know why that is.
Also, I thought the emphasis on mental illness was very profound. I liked the part where he wrote down something like ""Why is it that when you have a mental illness people expect you to behave as if you don't?""4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

People need to stop comparing to Heath Ledger. Joaquin gave a fantastic performance. Period.,"I dont understand why do people have this urge to compare the 2 jokers. Todd phillips shows us the slow descent of a loner into madness, whereas Nolan's Joker show the level of menace Joker could go to. Both are fantastic, but when the fools start to compare, they are not comparing apples to apples. Ofcourse Joaquin's role as Joker wont be as crazy, menacing & fear inducing as Heath Ledger's coz he is still coming to terms with being Joker. Anyways, with almost 95% of the screentime for one character alone, this movie was fantastic & lived up to my expectation of Joker. Some people would also be cheesed about the fact that there is a hugeee departure from the comic book, but i respect Todd's vision.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Complicated, DEEP, different, unusual and thought provoking!","Let me start by saying that when I left the cinema, I felt that I liked the movie a lot, and at the same time I felt disgusted by it. Maybe it's the portrayal of a broken man that has been put over the edge and gets really violent and crazy that left me feel that way.This movie offers a LOT of things to think about about our society, about our life in general and the way we treat the weak among us. I think this movie TRULY depicts how a psychopath is formed and the consequences this brings.The Joker is not ""likeable"" character but in many cases I think the public can explain his actions as being reasonable and logic.The movie is very, very, very deep and it's not just for entertainment purposes. I advise the public watching it have the mindset that they will be watching something truly different and not think of it as the latest Hollywood flick, because it is not.The movie is so deep I believe you have to watch it 2-3 times to grasp it.The acting is not great - it's UNBELIEVABLE! Joaquin MUST win Oscar with this. Movies like this are very rare and far in between. I hope more people can understand it because this is a complicated movie and I fear the broad audience won't grasp it's meaning."

Wrongfully Criticised Masterpiece,"Words need not describe the Masterpiece Todd Philips and the tour-de-force named Joaquin Phoenix created for the Audience...From the visuals the score to most importantly Phoenix's unabashed Acting, this film is a strong pointing finger at the society's negligence towards mental illness and the Ill effects it ultimately creates both at the community and the person... beautifully portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, the audience doesn't need an explanation to understand the theme, but solely through this one man's acting...as the protagonist loses his sanity one frame at a time, so does the film, finally culminating in a climax tying into the mythology so established by the Comics it based on...and thus is where the critics got it all wrong... wrongfully labelled PRO GUN VIOLENCE propaganda piece without any substance, they have tore this film with negative reviews, even preaching the audience to stay away from it altogether...my humble advice as a fellow movie goer.. please ignore those ""personal"" opinion of these so called ""reviewers""..go see for yourself...

Joaquin has achieved the seemingly impossible!,"I've seen every cinematic portrayal of the Joker so far and never thought I'd find myself saying anyone played the character better than Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix's version of the clown villian has matched and in my opinion exceeded that of The Dark Knight's. Phoenix keeps you mesmerised from start to finish, and you become totally enveloped in his story and character development.
Although Joker links in the Batman/Wayne storyline, do NOT go to the cinema expecting a comic book movie - this is a character driven drama and not one for the kids, with some pretty brutal scenes. Joaquin Phoenix is a tour de force in this movie, if he doesn't receive an Oscar for Joker it will be a travesty.

JOKER,"This movie was fantastic in my opinion. Plenty of critics hated on the way this movie was blandly reimagined from films like Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy, two films I thoroughly enjoyed. I thought the film had its own piece of uniqueness especially with Phoenix's amazing performance. From the first minute I was captivated and I loved what Joaquin and Todd were able to do with this character. The soundtrack and score for this movie was also very impressive. Hildur Guðnadóttir did a fantastic job and the score never felt over the top to me. Did I like Taxi Driver better, yes, but from a technical and film perspective. I do think, however, that this film manages to capture something that Taxi Driver doesn't and that is the unique saneness and personality of the character we know of as the JOKER.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

It's mature content delivers a punch so strong that you will find yourself pulled into a comic book movie.

A Cinematic Masterpiece. An Outstanding Performance By Joaquin.,"10/out of MF 10. Forget the media fear mongering. This was a relatable film because I am a female with some mental health issues and it covered that aspect with respect and the troubles that go along with being cut off of medication & services. Joaquin's performance is indeed Oscar worthy (not that it even matters to him) and it is on par with Ledger's. It also comes together nicely with a twist I didn't expect in the Batman universe. Anyone who has an issue with this cinematic masterpiece should stick to PG fluffy bunny Marvel films because this Alan Moore material is for us big kids. Go see this film.
Also on a side note I attended the movie with 3 other female friends who all LOVED it so this media outrage about it being only for a certain demographic is completely ridiculous.

Joaquin phoenix....WOW...,"Joker is undoubtedly the best movie of this year and one of the best in recent times.
When Joaquin phoenix was cast as joker I was a sceptical but after watching this film I can confidently say, he has full justice to this iconic character. His Maniac laugh, his mood swings, his dancing, makeup everything is perfect.
Now, joker is not a superhero movie it's more like a psychological thriller. It's dark and haunting and at times very disturbing. The background music is great and even though the story is slow paced, it has some surprises.
If you are a joker fan like me you will love it, if you love great cinema, you will love it.
Just keep one thing in mind, this is fiction, not a reality.
I have seen some of the criticizing the film based on some absurd reasons. They couldn't find anything wrong in the film but they thought it inspires gun violence and glorifies crime. Let's me tell you, It doesn't.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Irresistible content!!!!,"Joker who tries to spread happiness and joy to everyone, faced the harsh cruelties of life and lack of empathy from everyone. This movie basically shows the 1980s' America, when CCTV Cameras were not there and the grotesque and hideous act took place every now and then. He, who has mental disorder and uncontrollable-hysterical laughter, when pushed on the brink, comes out to be a sociopath and sadist. This movie basically show the harsh reality of today's world, where everyone is looking for their own benefit. No one is ready to see others' condition or show empathy. The plot of the movie is intriguing, strong and practical. Camera angles are totally perfect -like they even show the hand and legs movements of The Joker, whenever he feel excruciating, the ending of the movie is wonderfully captured- I mean the ending of the movie will make an impact on you even after the movie. Eventually, every single second of this movie is totally worth watching. Don't want to spoil anything because this is the irresistible content.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

This is my favourite Joker.,"If you haven't watched this movie then your missing out big time.Heath Ledger done a amazing job as the Joker in the Dark Knight.
In this Movie Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker and he done a excellent job, he starved himself so that he could play the part and that deserves mad props. In this film the Joker is way more dark
and creepy. The movie at first can be a little confusing for some people but a second watch will fix that.Thank you for reading my review.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

This may be one of the most important works of mainstream art in our time.,"The only emotion I was able to understand after watching this film for the first time was disturbed. It invoked one of the longest and thought-provoking conversations I've had after watching a film. One of the biggest being its portrayal of mental illness, which may have been the most realistic I've seen, and the graphic violence. Only after watching it a second time did I realize how little violence there is in the film. The way Todd Phillips was able to make the viewer feel so strongly about the protagonist's journey throughout is a testament to him, Joaquin Phoenix and anyone involved in the film, especially the way the cinematographer used colors. It balanced an original story and comic book origin story flawlessly and after the second viewing, was able to look past it's 'not so' graphic nature and understand everything Arthur was going through and was somehow able to empathize and disagree with a character at the same time as they slipped into madness. This may be one of the most important works of mainstream art in our time.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

How can it score lesser than a ""trashy"" movie like Last Jedi?Are the critics the only ones with the brains or artistic appreciation to rate movies?

"""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't""","First of all I'd like to say ""HATS OFF TO TODD PHILIPS AND JOAQUIN PHOENIX"". If you're a cinephile and haven't seen this movie on the bug screen, you're missing something!
The movie explores the life of Arthur Fleck and shows us how an ordinary man becomes the JOKER.
Daringly dark, this movie left me and many others speechless! No one was clapping when it ended, because the movie itself is a slap on the face of society! Everyone EVERYONE is a result of circumstances. This movie doesn't care about anything, it doesn't sugarcoat lies, it doesn't confuse reality with fiction, it takes the reality and puts a fictous yet amazingly real-like story in it! Do we take mental illness seriously? NO. Does this movie warns us of the consequences? YES. Should we relate to this movie and feel sympathy for Joker? NO. You know what ignorance and suppression leads to? It leads to JOKER!
Coming to the cinematic aspects of the movie, believe me when I say this, ""Joaquins acting was TOP TIER""! Credit goes to Todd Philips too for creating an amazing yet dark environment and daring to implement this story! Cinematography was on point and in fact one of the best that I've seen! I'm saying this again because no matter how many tines I say this it won't be enough, Joaquin acted as if he WAS Joker! This performance tops that of ""Her"" and will always live in cinematic history as one of the best EVER!
It would be needless to say that you should see this because YOU SHOULD SEE THIS!
Talking about my experience in cinema, I was shocked and SHAKING when the movie ended! The last 15 mins of the movie were one of the finest and intense piece of cinema ever made!
Joker shakes the society, slaps it's face, and puts forward a question, ""Where are we going as a society?"""
"This movie is beautiful, Joaquin Phoenix Would Make Heath Ledger Proud","This movie is beautiful. The message they deliver is immediately felt: it's portraying our society as a whole in the movie. This shows us exactly how some people are treated with disrespect, and being completely isolated as if they're not even a human being.Not only that, but Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal as Arthur Flex is astounding. You can see the high amount of time, and effort he's put on to being this character. He really hits home in the laughing, shows Arthur's struggles immensely with society in every scene. Phoenix also does an amazing job showing the descent into madness slowly, which just makes you feel even more terrible for the character Arthur Fleck, and what society had done to him. He really might've made Heath Ledger smiling down at him, saying: ""you've restored my Joker legacy"".Speaking of the descent into Joker, that was also handled very well. We first start off seeing Arthur as a weak, willed character. He slowly walks up the stairs in a weird, almost saddened way. He has a shaky voice, and almost zero confidence in himself. Arthur was pretty much broken down: a human that society treated as non-existent.However, when he becomes Joker, we immediately see he's happy as can be, dancing to his own music in his head down the steps as shown in the trailer and the movie. He actually feels more confident, not scared to express himself, albeit in a twisted way of course.I suggest you give this masterpiece a watch, you won't regret it."

Open up your empathy and you will be hurt deeply,"One of the best, maybe even the best, movies I have seen in the last and in this year so far. A misunderstood movie if you read the reviews on the news. Is it brutal? Yes. Is it shocking? Yes. Does it cheer people up to become violent? No. This movie asks the audience to look behind the obvious. It asks us to reflect ourselves, as the person we are on our own and the society we builded up. As an empath I was deeply touched and hurt by the suffering of Arthur Fleck, the main character. His development is relatable and performed brilliantly by a Joaquin Phoenix in best form. JP is transforming in both characters, Arthur and then becoming more and more the Joker, so very commiting that it will take your breath. The score underlines perfectly the feelings of the main character and if you open up, this movie will get under your skin.

Excellent example of mental health portrayal in film!,"Aside from the storytelling of how the Joker came to be, this film beautifully captured the true essence of what it means to be living with a mental illness in a society that struggles to accept and understand it. The inaccuracies and exaggerations that come with the portrayal of mental illness in movies are all things we are prone to see and unfortunately fuel the stigma surrounding mental illness. It's refreshing to see a movie that tackles that stigma at its core by showing problems with society itself and how society treats individuals struggling with mental illness. It's very possible to merge entertainment with education and this movie exceeded that. While addressing issues like societal judgement and unhelpful medical staff, we were able to see it conveyed in a way that was also interesting and entertaining to see. The aspect that resonated with me the most was when Arthur called his therapist out for not listening and asking the same questions every week. Another aspect I found particularly interesting was how even though Arthur made efforts to get help and treatment, he wasn't given help when his therapist informed him that funding cuts were being made and he wouldn't be able to continue seeing her. Keeping the momentum of going to treatments and trying to get better is a long struggle that takes a lot of effort and work. Not being given the proper resources or support to keep that treatment can also be extremely detrimental and many are unfortunately put in this position. There are many individuals struggling with mental illness that do not have the resources to get help. I'm glad this point was reinforced in this film because there are individuals that want and seek help but simply do not have the resources to continue or find it. What made this movie unique was its ability to speak to a large audience, not only those struggling with mental illness but also those seeking to understand those that do. One of the ways Joaquin Phoenix prepared for his role was he studied up on how to portray Arthur's mental health struggles in the most accurate ways possible. One of the best ways we can tackle the stigma is to show more accurate portrayals and working alongside mental health professionals or psychologists so actors can portray those characters in the most accurate ways possible. While there are no justifications for Arthur's crimes, we did see how lack of empathy and support influenced the way he saw the world. The world can be a very cruel place, but the most important thing we can do is extend a helping hand to a stranger to spread a little joy in the world."

Disturbingly Realistic and Intense,"Wow. Joker is easily the best movie I've seen in a long time. I started watching it on my TV yesterday and was so disturbed by it I turned it off, not sure whether I'd finish watching it. Of course I did, today.What made it so intense for me, besides what makes it so intense for everyone, is that I worked in state mental hospitals for many years and personally knew criminally insane people. Also, I lived in Manhattan during the 70's and the mood, background and vibe portrayed in the film was spot on. When I read afterward that it was supposed to be '81, I was surprised because it appeared and felt so much like the 70's. Besides the shabby condition of the city back then, the whole political thread replete with looting and rioting suggested the great blackout of '77 and its aftermath, not to mention that iconic 70's film, Taxi Driver.As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance well, there's nothing original to say here. His portrayal of a psychotic man was phenomenal. In fact, I had a boyfriend in the '70's who looked like Arthur and while he was crazy, he was the picture of sanity compared to Arthur/Joker.Joaquin had a great script to work with. As a would-be screenplay writer myself, I have a great deal of admiration for Todd Phillips and Scott Silver. In particular the pacing of the script was fantastic, especially the way the details of the past were revealed well into the film. I experienced a sense of ah, now I understand, learning that Arthur's compulsive laughing arose from brain damage sustained during a beating from mom's boyfriend, also that he had a very painful and abusive childhood which explained a lot. There was an amazing sense of development and growing intensity of the character and his madness. Yes, it was somewhat predictable that something big and violent would happen at the end, but who cared? Even the ending was perfect, in my opinion.There were two things that I questioned: one was that Arthur did not use drugs or alcohol. That was certainly different, for the times and for a person with his extreme problems. The other was that the actress who plays Sophie I thought might have been too pretty and ""clean"" looking, meaning also not into drinking or drugs; her skin and eyes too clear, her weight just right, neither too thin nor too fat. It was a little difficult to buy that she would have been involved with Arthur and I was relieved when her attitude toward him changed.Joker is an awesome film and I think it will be days before I can stop thinking about it. It deserves every possible award it can get."
Joaquin Phoenix was amazing,"The movie and its message were good, but the acting was stellar and memorable. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Academy Award for his rendition of Arthur Fleck!

A journey. A short and sweet review!,"With all the hype behind this film it would have been easy to fail, but it doesn't. This film is original and doesn't have any filler. Everything adds to the story and means something. You sympathize with Arthur but at the same time understand and see him slowly losing his grip (what little he had) over reality. This was extremely real, and not the slightest bit cartoony and it was much better for that.A great soundtrack and very well acted, don't expect a bunch of humor, but expect to feel this film. Buckle up and enjoy the ride2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
This is as good as acting gets,"I've never written here; I've been moved enough by other films, but this one moves me just a bit further.Joaquin Phoenix is certifiably one of the greatest of all time. I've rarely seen a performance on par with Daniel Day Lewis, but he equals him in this role, and I've never seen ANYONE equal the talent of Lewis, who before I saw this was far and away the greatest in my opinion.There are lines and parts of scenes in this film that haunt me still, and I saw this a month ago.""Why would I steal his sign"" is one of those, and it is delivered in a way that is indescribably pitiful, and hopeless and simultaneously genuine and pertinent. It haunts me. That character haunts me.This is definitely one of the greatest performances, if not the greatest performance by an actor in film history."

Insert any Buzzword Here,"I have never been a superhero fan, I like Superman as a kid and that's it. New Superman films had zero interest for me. I wasn't surprised when they all turned out badly. I didn't expect much from Batman Begins but I remember being very impressed when I watched it. However nothing compares to the feeling upon watching Joker!Wow they nailed it. Goosebumps and can't stop thinking about how perfect the film is.This is how you do a gritty realistic comic book origin story. The film is Dark, Tense, Frightening and Relevant. The plot is completely believable, it's impossible not to feel for Arthur Fleck.Film critics have been hurting the film industry for a long time with their less than honest reviews, but recently in the age of Wokeness, its gone to a whole different level. See the Tomatoes Review from critics versus the audience score for example. This is a film that actually lives up to the buzzwords.This is the best film I have seen in years by far."
Outstanding.,"I know the name Todd Phillips from his first feature as a student film maker, the 1993 cult documentary on extreme punk rocker, GG Allin, 'Hated: GG Allin and The Murder Junkies. Joker has a few references to GG littered throughout. Joaquin's performance is breathtakingly outstanding.

"Beautiful film, outstanding performance","**BACKSTORY**
If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would simply be ""beautiful"". From the cinematography, to the acting & improvising, to the outstanding score, Joker is by far my favorite film ever made.If you knew me before this review, you'd know that I used to always choke up when asked what my favorite film was. I could not answer, and any answer I gave was not sincere in the slightest. This one however, is.**IS IT A COMIC FILM?**
I will say this; it's not really a comic book film at all, it is *loosely* based off of the character ""Joker"", so you shouldn't go into this film expecting it to be 1:1 lore, but in my opinion that plays a key in making it so good. If this movie (in my opinion,) went with a more comic-like approach, I would not have enjoyed it as much as I do and I am certain about this. Take my advice, when you watch this movie, don't go in with the mindset that you're gonna see ""Joker"" the comic villain, go in knowing this is a film about a guy who just wants to make people laugh & smile, and is challenged by the harshness of the world he lives in. With this mindset, I can guarantee you will enjoy this film much more, just keep the DC lore to a minimal.I know what you're thinking, ""Well then, why is it called Joker?""
Like I said, it's *loosely* based off of the villain, and just a creative take on his backstory. Other than that, I don't really have any great explanations for you other than I simply enjoyed the film better by looking at it from a real world stand-point.**REVIEW**
Joaquin's portrayal of Arthur Fleck was phenomenal! He reportedly lost ~52 pounds for the part, and it really shows during the film. The performance is INCREDIBLE. His uncontrollable laugh comes to mind, as in every scene it happens you can just feel the suffering Arthur is going through, there's a particular scene that I won't go into details about, but let's just say finally catches a break, and it's all ruined from his nervous laughter. These moments really show just how great Joaquin is as portraying emotion, you can feel every bit of the character's emotions through this film. Everything from his uncontrollable laughter, to his adorable kid-like nature, everything about this character seems real and genuine like he lost himself in the part.Joker would not be what it is without the collaboration of Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips. Had Phillips not given Phoenix so much freedom, I don't believe this film would have been as successful and Todd know's this, he's acknowledged it in an interview with (I forgot who) by saying something along the lines of ""You wouldn't be a great director if you had an actor like Joaquin Phoenix on and NOT allow him such freedom."" Not word-for-word, but you get the drift.When you watch this film, pay attention the colors. The colors beautifully match the feeling of every scene, with the orange and cyan blue light's it really makes for a beautiful film, you can pretty much find a great still in every single scene that is filmed.**OVERALL**
I give this movie a 10/10 and I've never felt so sure about a rating in my life. I think it is perfect, and honestly I do *not* want a sequel, this film is perfect as a one-off and I HIGHLY recommend you see it in theatre's before it is too late, this is not a film you want to miss the experience of seeing on the big screen."

A true masterpiece! And the oscar goes to .....,"I went to the theaters with a lot of expectations and I want disappointed .... I was actually blown away by this work of art .This movie was beautifully recorded, acted, and scripted from the opening scene to the ending credits .this movie gave us a new version of the joker that we've never seen before .. it gave the character the backstory he deserved .. and DC gave us the Joker solo movie we deserve... it's an origins story that will make you sympathize with joker,feel pity for him,laugh with him,like him, and of course fear him. This masterpiece was almost 2 hours long packed with a load of emotions .....I cant remember a single minute where i wasn't on the edge of my seat following every movement,every scene and every detail in this performance... and what a performance it was !!!!
Joaquin Phoenix nailed this role to no end, he was brilliant ! when the casting was revealed and we knew that Phoenix was getting the role I thought ""yeah this guy could deliver "" but I never expected this level of awesomeness and genius!
This film is a must see it will be remembered for a very long time ,I think it's by far the movie of the year and i guess both Phoenix and Todd Phillips deserve an academy award for this magnificent masterpiece !!"

"What he did was wrong, but was it the right thing to do at the moment ?","The creative liberty given to the director/writers has given a new blend on the way you look at the joker. You don't need to be a fan of DC and/or the joker to engulf in to this epic saga of the journey of a transformation of a character. Every moment you have sympathy with the protagonist, he outsmarts you and surprises with the next move. The cringe it creates what happens next and results in another fiasco.All the time you ask yourself what he did was wrong, but was it the right thing to do at the moment ?
The so cleverly written movie was very well crafted and Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the respect on impersonating the soul of the character, Todd Phillip from his history of making movies has totally changed, He has become joined the big boys league now.
It would be a sin here not to mention clockwork orange and how someone is forcefully made into something, although joker here was more forced by the society.
And finally, Heath Ledger, the joker from the dark Knight, this was how a psychotic mind like him will become after few years past. Saying which one was better is a bad comparison to make. But with all respects to heath ledger, Joaquin Phoenix faced the gradient of character, which gives him the lead."

"""Can you introduce me as joker?""","I remembered a lot of people calling out Joaquin Phoenix for being a potential joker and he sure is.I am not going to make this review long. The script is so fitting, the actors fall perfectly in their role and the cinematography was outstanding. The movie has a masterclass build up. In the build up of the movie they let us feel remorse for Arthur, but slowly we see him turn into someone we would all despite in real life. The music choice and the whole atmosphere in the movie was a story by it self.I am giving this a 10, because they really could have screwed up this movie and I am not greedy in giving ratings.Joaquin Phoenix, you did an amazing job and I would like to thank you for being such a talented actor."
Heath ledger must be smiling from heaven,"Wowww, wowwww , wowwww the hype is real ,One of the best movies i have watched in years. when DC first announced that they are making a new joker movie , I couldn't imagine someone else portraying the joker role rather than Heath , but now after watching the movie , i must say that Joaquin was good as Heath , he was epic , his voice , dance moves , and his lough , omg how did he lough like this , he made it feel so real , you could feel pain and emotions through this lough , just wow , it is an oscar performance.
Now lets talk about the movie , where can i start , first , it is the movie of the year for sure, the score , script , cinematography and ofcourse the acting was perfect , you could clearly see an amazing and well written character development . I really don't understand the negative criticism on joker, saying its too dark and it encourages violence , i mean all of the violent games people play this days , like GTA, call of duty , pubg , fortnite , and people blame the joker being a violent movie ...????

Phoenix does it again..,"I was initially sold on on its very first trailer, where I instantly realised that Phoenix's portrayal of Joker's humble beginnings would be another exemplary performance to add to his already prestigious filmography.
Now after seeing the movie in full, my assumptions are confirmed.This was a perfect example of how villains are made. How a history of abuse, trauma and neglect has resulted in a mental illness that has left our protagonist to function as a lonely awkward outsider on the fringes of society.
Most people in such a state are but a shadow of themselves, yet for men like Arthur, having hit rock bottom and awakening to the conclusion of having nothing left to lose, they set themselves free, allowing their alter ego to come out and play. And there's nothing quite as dangerous as a sharp and calculating man who has a few screws loose; loose enough to twist that moral code that most of us keep firmly intact.Although pure perfection, for me, would have it ending 5mins earlier, as he stood on the bonnet of that cop car, amidst the rioting, practically praised as the prince of anarchy. Had the credits rolled right then, in my mind, figuratively speaking, I would have stood up and given an applause consisting of five full-blown claps (that's three claps more than I'm accustomed to giving).I'm happy that this was the movie that the wife and I chose as our date-night outing. Last time we went to the cinema together was 7 months ago and were pretty disappointed with what we watched. But not this time. This time, we praised it all the way back home."
SMILE!!!,"This movie was what I was expecting when I heard phoenix would be the joker, was it violent?? yes, but what isn't!Too many people judged the film before the release date so I'm glad it performed.Did it have influence from other films?? Yes, but all film do.I highly recommend this film to those that like the DC universe for what it is ~ Not Marvel.Why I gave it a 10

Bucket list viewing.,"I'd been resisting seeing this film for weeks watching others and admittedly not really enjoying any of them. Finally there was nothing else of interest to watch so off we went.
The opening scene of laughter triggered a painfully visceral sense of discomfort. Like being hit with a 2X4 I was awake and focused. Like many others I did not expect this and I did not expect this from Todd Phillips so my bad on both counts. Powerful, moving and brilliant in many respects this seemed like a curtain going up to reveal a whole new form of film making. I couldn't help think of Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot"" and how it could be re-imagined so that today's audiences would flock to it. Using veils such as ""the Joker"" might just be the vehicle to make it work.
I'm also bemused at peoples comparisons to Heath Ledgers Joker. While the connection seems obvious, I'd suggest Ledger and Phoenix's joker should be judged independently as standalone works of creative brilliance.
Strangely I'm suddenly not interested in watching other comic book stories after seeing the Joker be they DC or Marvel.
If you like myself had/have any preconceived ideas, set them aside and see The Joker."

A very deeping movie.,"Joker"" is a 2019 film directed by Todd Phillips.
It is nothing but a message in favor of suffering people, forgotten and marginalized by the rest of society.
Today many people are just a mass of suppressants, selfish, cruel and exploiters towards the weakest needy. The reason why an individual behaves in a certain way does not matter. Only what others have seen count, I learned from third parties without making sure or investigating why he did it.
I hope the world changes.
May everyone realize that we are human beings who tend to do good but unfortunately we should move away from suppressors or those who represent antisocials. I hope everyone can realize how much we can do our best for ourselves and for the welfare of others. And that before judging a sick person, let everyone look inside their soul.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

I knew that experiencing his emotions would not only come with feelings of defeat and brokenness, but also the waking terror of a supervillain. It was perfect as an introduction for such a dark and derranged character, and shouldn't be seen as any less; Joker, as Pheonix or Ledger, will never be underestimated again with the new insight provided to his personal life.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

BRILLIANT,"Brilliant, simply brilliant. Pheonix is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale year of acting.

Let's dive deep!,"I heard a lot of people complaining about the fact that this Joker got nothing to do with Batman's Joker that we all know and love. Well, you're missing many points here!1-This movie is supposed to be a non-canon one, meaning it's more of else world story than it's a continuity.
2-The movie is made to tell the story of how society can drive a man into madness and they nailed it.
3-Up till this very moment, The Joker never had an origin story. In the comics you gonna have the vet accident, the failing comedian, the three jokers, the lazuras pit joker, etc. So why all the madness about a story that suggest a different background and taking a page from the comics as well while they do it resulting in the most believable and humane story ever!
4-The acting was great, the movie was meh! Seriously guys you're missing it all over again, if you think the acting is solid then the movie is solid cause this is a one man show, it tells the story from Arthur's perspective.Pay a good second watch to the movie and enjoy a masterpiece that we'll have to wait a while till we learn how to praise it."
Horribly awesome,"For me I call tell, this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life in term of acting, sound effects, story,..... despite of having very dark depressing moments in this movie, you still sense the feeling of greatness after finish watching the movie.
First time ever to watch a realistic comic movie which made him a one of a kind.
The problem is this movie might encourage some evil things in our real world to whose see themselves in this movie in a way or another, the fact that the moments and situations you experienced in the joker might happened to you through your life, how many times you got a depressing situations where someone enjoys making fun of you or mocking your life, character, origin, religion, skin color. Ideology or even just bullying you in school. Let's think about that.

More than expected,Buzz created by joker before the release is extraordinary. From trailer it's obvious that Joaquin phoenix did a Oscar worthy performance. And in trailers they haven't given away much. I was unsure whether it will reach my expectations. But this film crosses my expectations. Nothing extravagant or mind blowing. But the way the director told the simple story combined with extra ordinary acting and cinematography is simply superb. Go watch it in cinemas if you haven't watched already.... :)2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
Worthy of all the praise it can get,"What is there to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Joker is a meticulous, expertly crafted piece of art, in terms of writing, direction, cinematography, and especially performance. Every element of this film is a solid piece of the framework and each lends their strengths to each other in a way that hasn't been seen in a comic book movie before.From Pheonix's heart-wrenching, mesmerizing, and terrifying performance, to the tension building, tragic score, to the harsh depth of field that leaves the viewer in a dream-land, as if everything in the world is an illusion. There isn't a single element of Joker that isn't filled with passion and careful consideration. A week after seeing it and I've done nothing but think about each element more and more - it's a story that begs for repeat viewings, filled to the brim with detail, leaving space for theorizing and conspiring, the perfect way to do a Joker origin movie:""If I'm going to have a past, I'd rather it be multiple choice""The only slight downfalls of this near masterpiece is that in some parts it can feel a little repetitive, and it does heavily borrow from Scorcese films such as Taxi Driver & King of Comedy, but ultimately these are minor nitpicks in an unforgettable, unsettling, and thought-provoking narrative that will continue to be discussed and theorised for years.Filled with quotables, memorable moments, shocking moments, shocking moments with hints of Joker comedy, this is definitely the perfect Joker origin story, as well as an important message/warning to society regarding the 1%."
One of the best character breakdown,"The character grows beautifully and the acting skills were perfection, I know you probably seen some reviews criticising the violence but this movie shows that when you don't recognise mental health problems and on top you get bullied on a daily basis then it can only lead to two things.. one you end up dead through suicide or you become suicidal and others end up dead.

Cinematic Genius,"It's been 12 hours since I saw Joker at my local cinema and my head is still spinning.
I didn't get much sleep and I'm still trying to process what happened.
It was nothing short of a feast for the senses and I just wanted more.Make no mistake - this is cinematic brilliance at its highest level.
A masterpiece.
Hauntingly beautiful, magnificent, mesmerizing.
Stunning.
Chilling.
I honestly don't think I blinked during the two hours in fear of missing something.The onscreen world immediately captures you and pulls you in to an 80's Gotham City.
The thunderous Dolby Atmos soundtrack is beautiful, chilling and at times downright terrifying.If you are expecting a non-stop gore fest then you will be bitterly disappointed.
There are a handful of shootings.
What you will experience is a classic film of unprecedented genius, both artistically and technically.I must admit I went into the theatre with a bias towards Joaquin Phoenix.
Everyone has read the stories of his whacky antics and frequent meltdowns.
I'd seen his on set rant on talk show Jimmy Kimmel a few weeks back and thought him to be just another pretentious actor.
All is forgiven.
His performance in this film is truly breathtaking.Joker is not just another DC superhero film, it's a journey into the mind of a twisted psychopath who needed help but didn't get it.
For some reason, actors who have previously played this character (Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, Romero, etc.) have all turned in both sterling and mesmerizing performances.
But it's Phoenix who now wears the crown as The Clown Prince Of Crime.Here is my rather modest prediction come Oscar season.Best picture.
Best screenplay.
Best director.
Best cinematography.
Best actor in a leading role.
Best musical score.
Best sound editing.What I'm trying to say is this is undoubtably the best piece of modern cinema I have ever seen.P.S. For those uneasy about Gary Glitter coining in the royalties for his track in the film, his catalogue was bought out years ago by a UK based publishing company so he will not be receiving a dime for the tracks inclusion."

Fact of the matter, we witnessed a little more than we signed up for. Joaquin phoenix delivered a new standard for acting, embracing a complex dramatic ascension of the Joker character throughout the movie, shedding focus on the horrendous truth of the society we live in.

Joaquin Phoenix found his destiny in this role.After watching this movie I saw an imaginary line in the end credits ""This movie is dedicated to all the lost and tortured souls out there"".

Joker is a victim of an uncaring society,"This movie is a story of mentally ill person being pushed out of society, abused by people around him and broken by people he idolize.
This isn't a some fictional story filled with CGI, and to some this isn't even a fictional story. There are lots of people who are treated just like Joker. They suffer in silence, their existence is treated as nuisance, their calls for help are called ""toxic"" or ""privileged"". Society so happily mistreat people, but then act in shock and horror when those people break.
Joker is a movie about pain and irony of the world. It shows how society treat those who are different and how it repays those who have dreams. This movie forces abusers to see the life of their victims, it shows the consequences of careless evil. That is why abusers and generally evil people can't stand this movie - because it shows them who the true villain is. Joker isn't the villain of this movie. He does lots of horrid things, the character should rot in jail for his actions, but shouldn't the people who made him suffer the same fate? Joker is a product of torture, so he lashes out against his torturers. Nothing more.By the way, it also have great comedic moments, but as Joker says himself: ""Humor is subjective""."

The dark cruel world of the Joker.,"JOKER is a dark, depressing, moody, violent masterpiece. The film rest upon the shoulders of Joaquin Phoenix and he pulls it off brilliantly! The entire cast is awesome especially De Niro and Zazie Beetz.It's hard to believe the guy who directed The Hangover trilogy and Road Trip is the same guy who directed this punch in the gut brilliant flawless slow burn gritty glorious film.There is no Batman to battle or evil supervillain to play off of. This is the story of one man's journey into darkness and that is why Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is easily the best Joker that has ever graced the big screen in my opinion.Will Phoenix win the oscar? Probably not. I can't see that spineless (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) politically correct tool of an organization giving out any major awards to a film this good.Joker is the best movie I've watched in the past 10 years. The flick gets 10 out of 10 severed thumbs.If you didn't already know the story centers around Arthur Fleck a mentally troubled comedian as he embarks on a downward spiral of social revolution and bloody crime.

A very uplifting movie !,"This movie was a bit different from what I had expected yo see, in that, for a movie about a joker there are very few jokes, and very little humor. It is still very worth seeing, though. It does address the very real and pressing issue of income inequality, and the feelings of isolation and futility that many people feel today. These are really the most moving scenes of the movie, and the ones that really cast Arthur in the role of the every man we can all relate to. The way that he becomes an icon to all of his ""clown"" admirers, especially toward the end of the movie, was the most uplifting part of the movie. The fact that there is a scene that is very similair to the one shown in the original 1989 Batman film makes this film both a Batman and Joker origin story.

Put on a happy face!,"You won't actually be putting on a happy face while watching Joker, what you'll be doing instead is witness the greatest film of the year and the Oscar-worthy performance of Joaquin Phoenix. His performance is extraordinary, every single time you hear him laugh, you know something is wrong and you start to feel uncomfortable, add all that to his facial expressions and acting skills and you've got yourself a perfect performance that will be talked about for years to come. What this movie does to its viewers is fantastic, you're on the edge of your seat through all of its runtime which is about 2 hours. Joker is full of shocking scenes and so many surprises and it utilizes its R-rating very well. As we know this movie talks about mental illness and what it does to people and how it affects them specially when those people get abused or be made fun of, and Joker portrays this so perfectly that you even tend to sympathize with the main character, not that he is a good guy, he's not, he's the Joker after all, but by the way of how they portrayed this, you will be able to relate to this character and understand what he's going through so that by the time his story comes full circle and you see his character evolve to the clown prince of crime we all love to hate and hate to love, you'll be very satisfied and upset at the same time by how he becomes the Joker and it's all in a good way. Joker has quite the Easter eggs and references to other movies like the King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as the director Todd Phillips said that those two movies inspired him to do Joker, so you'll definitely feel some elements of those movies in here too. Talking about this movie without spoiling it is so difficult, but all i'll say is this: Joker is a drama masterpiece and it's not like any other comic book movie that's been made before, this is an original story that is based on the character ""Joker"" from DC comics but with a new and a deep origin story that is basically a character study that'll leave you wondering and thinking about how devastating it is by the time the credits start rolling.Verdict: Joker is one of those movies that after viewing, you will need to sit down and try to take it all in because it dives deep into what mental illness is and how it can affect people and how society can be a part of that transformation."

What A Performance,"I was skeptical at first about this movie when I first heard that they were going to be producing a solo Joker film. But after viewing the trailer numerous times, I realized this could be one of those hit or miss films. This film for me was a hit, everything from the acting to the cinematography. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and is a fine representation of why the film industry in America is known as the best. Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job as the joker. Truly a gut wrenching performance, which could be argued by many as a Oscar worthy performance. Truly this film is one of the greatest films produced in 2019.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Surprisingly Excellent...HONESTLY,"Joker Review, No spoilers
My rating for Joker: 9.5 !
LOVED the movie!!! Had me thinking the whole time. Had its aha moments, moments of sadness and laughter. I am almost positive that we ALL laughed out loud at the same scenes...especially that one scene in the apartment near the end of the movie. Bringing up the 2 father figures and an ill mother really helped develop Arthur along with the tragedies that happened in his life.
His condition was believable based off of his excellent performance and animated laugh. Loved that Zazie Beetz was in this movie. Adored her character. Appreciated how a Joker movie was not all about Batman or Bruce Wayne. I couldn't have done the ending any better because the implication was perfect and they didn't have to spell it out for us. I'm convinced that Todd Phillips, the main producer, is an absolute genius. After watching this emotional rollercoaster, this movie deserves AT LEAST an Golden Globe nomination, if not a victory.
My only criticism is on some of the camera shots, although I understand how hard it is to make sure the main subject of the shots are always in the limelight. For instance, the train and bank scene . Also, depending on what kind of a movie watcher you are, you may not enjoy the layout of the music. For me, it was enjoyable.Do you think this joker movie will tie into Robert Pattinson's Batman movie?"
Fulfilled all my expectations,"The Movie takes you through a journey where you see this iconic character develop and transform right in front of your eyes.

A work of art,"I rarely give a perfect note but this movie deserves 100%. An origin story like you have never seen before. It seems so real that it could easily happen in the real world.
It points a finger to real life problems like desinstitutinalisation and the lack of help and follow up for people who suffer from psychiatric problems.
Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible. He is not playing the Joker... he IS the Joker. His performance deserves an Academy Award. He is a method actor who transforms his body and his soul for his roles.
The cinematography (Lawrence Sher) is breathtaking. He is able to create a very heavy and dark ambiance that keeps us hooked. It's visually stunning. As the transformation of Arthur into the Joker advances, the camera makes the character seem bigger and just with that we can feel the confidence that he develops.
Todd Phillips has written, produced and directed was is, in my opinion, a work of art. The movie is heavy and difficult to watch at times. There are some very graphic and violent scenes but they are all necessary to the character development. I very rarely feel a deep internal unease as I watch a movie but I did as I watched how sad and tragic Arthur's life was.
The fact that they are able to make the watchers feel compassion for a psychopath is not an easy task.
The character development makes sense for once.
This is not a comic book movie. It's a character study.
Wow."
"""Don't Smile""","In a time where super hero movies dominate the circuit, it is so refreshing to get to see the other side i.e. the ""villains"" perspective.

Send in the clowns.,"One of the best aspects about DC's iconic Clown Prince of Crime, The Joker, is the ambiguity of his origins. Alan Moore's phenomenal graphic novel The Killing Joke (1988) provides us with one of the many possible origins for the character, but even Moore's renowned interpretation isn't considered to be the definitive backstory. Making his debut in Batman #1 in 1940, The Joker remains one of the most recognisable villains in the history of comics. Each appearance of The Joker, from The Dark Knight Returns (1986) to The Killing Joke, to Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on a Series Earth (1989) to Batman R.I.P (2008), and many, many more, stands as a uniquely different portrayal of the character, while still maintaining the core essence of his psychotic persona. Todd Philips' stand-alone origin story Joker is no exception. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a party clown pursuing a career (unsuccessfully) as a stand up comedian in Gotham City. He lives in a rundown apartment with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and suffers from a condition which causes him to laugh uncontrollably in inappropriate situations. Disregarded by society, Arthur slowly spirals into a life of crime, paving the way for the creation of his maniacal alter-ego, Joker.When it was announced Warner Bros. Pictures were developing a stand-alone Joker film, I was one of the many sceptics who claimed (with absolute confidence) that such an idea was unnecessary. Heath Ledger delivered an outstanding performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), and his portrayal has been long regarded as the highwater mark for those daring enough to adopt the role. Jared Leto's odd, over-the-top portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime wasn't embraced by neither fans nor critics in 2016's terrible Suicide Squad, which led many to believe the Joker role had become untouchable since Ledger's critically acclaimed portrayal. However, in Joker, Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the titular character. Phoenix embodies the role perfectly; his performance doesn't mimic Ledgers (and rightfully steers clear of all Leto's shortcomings), and instead crafts a whole new take on the character while still maintaining the core essence of what makes The Joker so renowned. Phoenix brings a damaged realness to the role and embraces the sinister undercurrents of Fleck's mentally disturbed psyche. At times, he's downright unnerving. On occasion, I was reminded of Matt Dillon's performance as Jack in Lars von Trier's serial killer epic The House That Jack Built (2018). Both Arthur and Jack are mentally disturbed loners who harbour sinister urges, but what distinguishes Arthur Fleck from Trier's Jack (who, by all accounts, is a killer who isn't fumbling for validation in his crimes) is how he finds justification for enacting his own immoral sense of justice onto a society that has wrongfully disregarded him. It is important to note that you aren't coerced into rooting for Arthur as he descends further into madness. By no means is Joker portrayed as an antihero; you sympathise with him when the film begins, but this sympathy is short-lived once Fleck ultimately falls victim to his own heinous choices. From his maniacal laugh to his off-kilter, deranged mannerisms, Phoenix delivers a masterclass performance that would certainly make Ledger proud.Make no mistake, Joker is not what you've come to expect from the modern day comic book film. Philips and Silver have crafted a script that is grounded in reality and, at its core, it is a focused, psychological character study that trades in CGI spectacle (something that largely dominates comic book blockbusters these days) for mean-spirited, gritty nihilism. It's brilliantly constructed and certainly benefits from repeat viewings, as there is much of the film that is left open to interpretation. Hildur Guðnadóttir provides the film with a terrific score; it's brooding and eerily atmospheric, and stands as one of the best film scores of recent memory. It is a film dripping with atmosphere and tension that gradually elevates towards a finale that embraces the anarchy that Joker is known for. Joker has certainly garnered its fair share of controversy on the road towards its highly anticipated release, largely due to its violence and perceived influence it may inflict on audiences. While the film certainly has its violent moments, the violence never once overshadows the central narrative, nor is it as violent as the detractors would have you believe. What Joker ultimately serves as is a cautionary tale, while shining a light on how corruption can manifest within society.Joker is everything one could want from a Joker origin story. Dark, tense and fiercely gripping, it stands as one of the all time great Joker stories with a career best performance from Phoenix at the heart of it all. Destined to become a celebrated classic, Joker is this years must see film."

That's Life- Fits in like a glove,"Joker is not a movie of pretense. It is about the truth.I think most people who disliked this movie disliked it because they were expecting some fairy tale, like they always do. But that's not the reality, is it? It hardly ever is. This movie portrays how much society can break you from within. This movie shows the struggle of a common man. It doesn't need any universe to follow, because it is a masterpiece on it's own.I went in to see a movie about this DC villain, but what did I get? I got exposed to the truth. It was certainly clever how the writers mixed a fictional character with someone who's living in this world and gave us something we kept thinking about hours after we came back from the theater.And Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Joker was as moving as the script. It was dark, it was bone-chilling and most importantly, it was brave. To portray a character like that, it takes guts. And he did justice.In all, it was worth it. Making this film was worth it. Received by many as a cold-hearted comedy, well you have it. That's life."

Best Joker's body language thus far.,"Uniqueness of this production, when compared with Batman comic books, games and other movies, is undeniable. Joker's identity and his plans are very much the opposite of a mystery in here. This shift in perspective may just be what ""Joker"" needed to be the best movie based on a character from DC.For some reason, Joker is always taken very seriously by actors playing his role. Jack Nicolson's and Heath Ledger's Jokers were definitely phenomenal yet mostly acted by voice and facial expressions. It's fair to say that Joaquin Phoenix raised the bar by an order of magnitude. In his version of the Joker, voice acting and facial expressions are just minor parts of a bigger picture. His Joker moves like Joker. His Joker laughs and dances like Joker. It's very apparent how his Joker thinks, and he thinks like the Joker. He just feels like him. The level of immersion is unprecedented.Artistically, ""Joker"" is just beautiful. Music is perfect, Gotham feels enchanting but depressing, character costumes are very appealing. Whole experience is hypnotic, almost like in a comic book.Besides a true Joker and good Gotham, the movie contains some less important themes which aren't bad but may be distracting. It felt like they put two rather irrelevant scenes featuring young Bruce Wayne just for the sake of using the franchise. I also think that yet another version of Batman origins scene is the last thing a DC fan would like to see. All easily forgivable as everyone leaves their yaw on cinema floor anyway."
The call of the wild of super hero movies,"This movie tops the limits of what you can feel in a super hero movie like no other. No plain black and white characters no good vs evil. Just emotions and feelings. With some of the best scenes portraying the cinema industry like, joker dance, joker running and joker puts a bloody smile on his face. I definitely will have issues watching support hero's movies that will cover all the struggles and emotional drama in favor of punchlines and tension reliefs.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A Masterpiece which would have worked as great even if it had not relation with the BATMAN Universe,"JOKER is a psychological study of the character, Not your regular comic book Movie. The movie forces audience to think deeply about issues regarding morality, mental health, bullying, the rich and the society as a whole. The main focus of the movie is the mind of Arthur and how it fragments apart under the many inhumane but impactful acts of the society which when pile up brings out the Joker in Arthur. What makes this hit the core of masses, is its relatability. He's a relatable kind of villain, bullied and sad. It also depicts how mental health issues are ignored by the corporates and the suffering people become even more isolated. Joaquin Phoenix has done a phenomenal job, even just looking at his laugh in which he has masterfully depicted the hidden sorrow behind the character, makes you realize that the man has worked hours and hours just to make this perfect. Cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack suited the storyline perfectly. Even if the movie had no relation to the Batman universe at all, it would still have worked just as great. In the end, although you can't justify the acts of Arthur, but you definitely understand them."

Wow. Just wow.,"I am beyond words. This movie is phenomenal. It is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix definitely is my favorite live action Joker. Yes more than Heath and Jack (although i really HATE comparing them). This is not your typical comic book movie. It is a character study about a man who becomes the Joker. About what it took to drive him this far. The film is dark, disturbing and masterful work of art. Its one of the most beautiful movie i've ever seen. This movie deserves an Oscar. Not just beat actor, but best score, best cinema photography, best film and of course, best director, which definitely goes to the man Todd Philips. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an oscar i'll riot. Believe the hype and screw the haters. Its truly beautiful. But dont just take my word for it, take all of the other 100's of positive reviews that say the same thing. I seriously wish there was a higher number than 10. This is like a 101/10. Just check it out. You won't regret it.

Finally someone's on par with Heath Ledger,"Heath Ledger's Joker was total chaos. Very smart, spontaneous and stupendously brave.
But Joaquin Phoenix's joker is a man oppressed by the heartless, careless society and broken financial system. He's born in poverty that has deprived him of his social rights.
Joaquin Phoenix has out done himself and justified the extremely high acting bar set by Heath Ledger.

You root for Joker, you're terrified of Joker, and then you love him again.

"Sometimes i remember it one way, sometimes i remember it another.","The Joker has many origin stories, in comics, in movies or even series.
What this movie essentially does, is amplifies the best qualities that Joker offers.
It is a raw, sickening, intriguing and unsettling movie that understands what Joker is supposed to be, unpredictable, chaotic, the ebb which flows.I have so many good things to say, and literally no negativity towards this movie.
Amazing visuals, spectacular actor who portrays Joker, good music, stylish and memorable scenes.As a fan, this is everything i ever wanted. If this is your first Joker movie,
expect to be shocked, repulsed, disgusted, intrigued.
This is what Joker is, this is what joker has always been and should always be.A solid 10/10, i can't believe we live in a world where movies from DC can be this good."

"Big Holes That Society Has, And Are Covered","I can resiliently say that Joker is a movie the world needed. Most critics get carried away by political, personal and sometimes illicit influences as they review it. In this way it presents a disturbed view of masterful works. Joker touches delicate subjects in a way that is rarely seen in today's theaters. If the world can't handle a profound work like, then it means the world needs to change. And change the way we view complex social issues, which we prefer to isolate it from debate because of the high diversity of opinion. Very well built and set, Joker brings big holes that society has, and are covered.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Speechless.. Stunned !!,"My review is incomplete as there is so much to discuss but i am speechless.. This is by far one of the most ""well done"" movie based on the life of a mentally ill person. You are very much instilled in the shoe of a person who has mental illness and has to face the modern day society who expect him to behave.. as if he doesn't !! For me this move is 1 step beyond another master piece called ""Memento (2000)"" which was also based on a mentally ill character. But Joker is an extensively Dark movie for a main-stream Cinema specially when he is dancing he is sending a layered message to the audience. Most of the times this movie gives you the feel of an Art Movie (more than just an action flick or superhero flick). The dark and disturbing part of this movie is sheer work of Art that too performed with utter brilliance. And last but not least, Phoenix is by far the best and most Realistic Joker ever.. for me he did a PERFECT job of not only Joker but also a mentally ill person.. Perfect expression, laughter and dialogue delivery .. In the End Please NOTE: that when i said 'mentally ill' i meant a person Not Fit for modern day hypocrite Society : )"

-A dark masterpiece-,"Don't go into this movie thinking that it's going to carry the same tone as the dark knight. This movie goes much further than that, and brings an even more realistic approach to the character and this world.

All I have are positive thougts,"One more masterpiece for the DC movies. Joaquin Phoenix deserves for sure his oscar and Todd Philips did an amazing job not only as a director but also as a writer. I fully recommend this movie to all the fans of the dark knight and to those who love character development and interesting dialogues and quotes and generally movies that keep you thinking hard for weeks. So it is important to remember that this Joker is a different version of the character and so you should not hope for another 2008-Joker. Moreover, it is not a Nolan movie and so its main theme and focus are different from the Dark Knight since Joker is a drama-thriller movie. And this is the reason why it is such an unique film-masterpiece. Finally, it is one of the most interesting movies I have ever watched.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

It's so much more than a character study.,"There is a danger to this film.An origin story, sure. But a warning about how society, friends and family can slowly wear away at a person - and how there's no time taken by anyone to understand anyone who is struggling, is different, who's 'failing'.Like driving and parenting, those who are poor at these things, seldom realise just how bad they are. With social responsibility and awareness, people are just the same. Everyone thinks they're good. Posted that suicide awareness meme? Tick. I'm a solid human being. Then post a video of that weirdo on the bus.The film has divided many. I suspect that those who've not enjoyed it are those with little empathy or those lucky enough not to have an ignored struggle to cope with. Certainly not adrift from society, or failing to 'achieve' (urgh). It's quite likely the film's closing line was a predictor of those reactions. I was the only one laughing at this and a few other moments.Phoenix cuts through his character's psyche here more than Joker does any victim. He breathes and cries loneliness. There are several moments which openly show his struggle to join in with a world he doesn't fit into. He waltzes through these and more, pulling you on-side and deeper and deeper. And I felt it. Very much.And that's where it could be dangerous. A potential call to arms.But above all, it's a remarkably engrossing piece, linking as much with King Of Comedy as with the Batman story. Drawing the links between the two worlds into focus too, and forcing us to question our ignorance and to challenge known truths.Phoenix will win Best Actor for this. Rightly so."

"Incredible dark gritty movie, forget rich powerful superheros, this is the time of the underdog.","After falling out of love with the Marvel & DC universes and now pretty much giving up on all super hero movies altogether, I was apathetic when the ads for Joker first appeared in my local cinema. I looked at my 16 year old son, who loves watching movies too, and we both shared the same thought: ""yeah whatever""....But as the trailer rolled, it started to look interesting. Then I checked facebook, and friends who had seen the trailer too were talking excitedly. Someone said ""in Marvel they take a human and give him superpowers, here we have the opposite, a man who has everything taken away from him"" and that really resonated with me.This is one of the most important movies of our time, starring one of the most important actors of our time, the incredible Joaquin Phoenix, who has blazed a trail of cinematic excellence for many years and who's career, I think, culminates to huge climax here in this film.It's dark, dark, dark. So damn gritty and real the camera work gives us this filthy downtrodden vision of Gotham and city on the brink of self destruction. No one flys or has a special suit there are no superpowers, or laser beams, there is just a man being spat out by the system, which is run by the rich for the rich and is becoming increasingly greedy and selfish. Included in this system is the Wayne family, who despite whatever their intentions actually are, are presented here as little more than white over privileged rich people who live in a huge gated house with private security. Yeah whatever Bruce but did you ever really spend time in the ghetto?This is the commentary and Joker is trying, he's really trying to absorb the hate and the crap and the downright hardship that life is throwing at him, but he lacks the presence of mind to do it quite literally, struggles with an insane urge to laugh all the time even when things are absolutely not funny and of course the rest is history.I hope this doesn't spoil it for you, go and watch it, that's 2 hours of your life you will want to repeat."

Perhaps the most human villain I've ever seen,"If watching this film was a game of chess, you'd be playing against an opponent who won the game before it even started. No matter how you defend your king, your opponent outmaneuvers you and penetrates your emotional defenses every step of the way. Other directors should take notes because this is character study drama at its finest.While some will say it moved too slowly, I personally feel it was paced perfectly given the content; a slow-bleeding, 'death by a thousand cuts' delivery, which gradually ramps up over the course of the entire film. The juxtaposition of humor and despair had my emotions on a tilt-a-whirl throughout, and was accompanied by a soundtrack that complemented the themes very well.I highly recommend watching this one at least once, but steel yourself because it packs quite a punch.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
An experience one must have!!,"Let me just say that no, the praise everyone has heard about this before it released was not the usual overhyping of a movie from critics at festivals, it was 100% deserved, I completely understand why it got an 8 minute standing ovation at Venice and yes, I did clap when this movie ended, and so did the packed audience at the theatre I went to.I mean, can you blame me? From the minute ""Joker"" starts you are glued to the screen, I literally did not avert my gaze for a second. Joaquin Phoenix gives probably the best performance of his life (and that's saying something) and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.The story, even though a tad predictable, is amazingly written, full of great moments, both funny and dramatic and really shows
us why Arthur Fleck decides to turn into the homicidal maniac that is the Joker.Overall this is probably my favourite comic-book movie of all time, if not just my favourite movie of all time, the way Todd Philips directed his feature is astonishing, I mean this movie looks sooooo good and I, for one, cannot wait to see what he does in the future.A+"

Witness the magic of cinematography as it was always meant to be!,"Yep! I will need to see this at least once again to fully understand how great it was. I don't think I have seen such deep dive into insanity since a good while. As the story slowly unfolds a very unsettling sensation took hold of me because I ashamedly realised I sympathise with Arthur Fleck and his actions. The cinematography is purely superb and finally I have seen a new colour palette that wasn't repeated a thousand times. There were so many potentially iconic scenes that will become memes and film history, that on its own makes this movie worthy of appraisal. I'd love to see how Joaquin Phoenix went inside the head of the Joker, because he definitely studied symptoms of insanity in depth. So many great things been already said about this film, I won't repeat those. The last 20 minutes of the film is freaking intense and when the Joker finally let all his will to pretend to be sane go, you will witness an unparalleled transformation that's not going to be forgotten or topped by anyone in our lifetime. There were so many moments in Fleck's life when he could have been helped or stopped, but society just didn't care for him. Hunted, bullied, despised, ridiculed and ultimately lied to by everyone including his closest relatives...no wonder he became the Joker. I am so happy this movie could happen in this time and age of ultra sensitivity and its reception is so overwhelming. In the diarrhoea of degenerate Disney flicks here we have a movie that will make people think and talk about it for hours on end. And finally f..k the Oscar for Best Movie, this movie already won the most significant award in Venice where real cinematic art is awarded not the best money making scheme. Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for Best Actor of 2019. Nothing I have seen this year touches his performance...not a thing! Oh, the soundtrack. How could I not mention the heart wrenching score by the Icelandic cello artist and composer Hildur Gudnadottir?! Anyone remembers the subway scene and then the following impromptu dance in the toilet with that amazing score in the background? That's called perfection!👍🏻"

Prequel to the dark knight trilogy,"This is the best DC movie since the dark knight (part 2) and you can consider it prequel to batman begins
Great performance from phenix to joker character development from a regular mentally unstable person to the most famous criminal in the world which is completely different story from what ledger gave us as you can consider joker movie is the answer of the question: how could any human be the joker ?
And the very first moment of this human as the joker then you watch ledger present the joker in his prime after mastering criminal methods and have his followers
Joker along side batman begins and the dark knight gave us a great saga and if DC want more glory thy can make one or two more movie to complete what could happen in the future of the dark knight between batman and joker to make historical saga can compete with infinity saga and Star Wars2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

It's simply a masterpiece,"This movie is amazing in every way. Joaquin Phoenix really nailed the role as the crazy, psychotic Joker. He was the perfect actor for this role and without him the movie would not be the same. The story is very good and well-written, and a lot of people seem to agree with me. Everyone should definitely take the chance to go watch it while it's still in theaters. Don't listen to the bad reviews, most of them expected this movie to just be another superhero vs villain movie where the Joker is just a boring old villain with a clown's face. No, this is not one of those films. This is a much darker, more original villain movie that focuses on the problems in our society. So, go watch the movie in theatres while you still can!2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"I've seen sociopathy up close, this is the real deal!","This movie made me create an account to review it.
I've watched it twice in the cinema in 12 hours.
Here's the thing, I studied sociopathy for a few months after seeing it up close in a close person. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just deliver what may be the best performance an actor ever gifted the world (perhaps tied with Branston Cranston's Walter White in Breaking Bad).
But he behaves exactly like a sociopath does, with an origin story that perfectly maps that of many sociopaths - which I won't spoil you with.
He should get one Oscar for best actor, and one for accuracy and realism.
This is not just a movie, it a scientific achievement and it will be used by psychologists and psychiatrists for Aeons to come.
This movie is currently rated 9.2 despite Marvel fans voting it 1 star just to make Endgame higher.
Do the math and you'll see, that means that Joker is right now the highest rated movie in history. Anyone who criticizes Joaquin's perfomance is simply a fortunate person, who never actually met a sociopath and can't understand what they're seeing.
This movie will still be remembered a century from now.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Shocked,I was rather shocked when watching joker when I say shocked I mean it was excellent. I felt like it wasn't a stereotypical DC film which I loves as they did it different. For me this is one of the best movies that DC has made. The character portrayed in the film is outstanding it is very psychological with the emotions of the characters and we end up feeling attached to the character. I felt very sorry for him and then we end up routing for him. It was well executed and I would give it a perfect 10 .

But joker in the second half is a person who shows that innocence and sacrifice do not actually mean anything to people. people's approach to us affects us. arthur has also transform Joker in a corrupt system.

In your face call for justice that upsets the corrupt elite,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypo crites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is."
Wow!,"Can't even believe the basic and stupid bad critics to this masterpiece. You know nothing about acting, directing and post production work if you don't like this movie. From the beginning to the end it's a delicious journey into this perturbed mind and how every act is introduced is incredible surprising. I think the people don't like it is because they were looking for big explosions, stupid CGI and poor acting as they are used to in MCU movies. Oscar will say the truth ;)2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"Great character study, nothing to be scared about","Too many movies out there of unhinged characters that are way more problematic to blame this one for the state of violence in America. In fact, it matches the tone def blame Gotham has in the movie for the first act, anger at a vigilante clown, and not the state of society and lack of social services that got them there. Excellent cast, wonderful performance, and shame on all the people who vilified it for personal gain. While it might not be for everyone, especially those not interested in delving into the origins of a mad killer character, there are even more gruesome origin stories out there, this one doesn't deserve all this solo negative attention.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Phoenix and Phillips craft a masterpiece,"This is the greatest depiction of a comic book charachter in a movie of all time. Phoenix inhabits this man outcast by society and destined to be the greatest villain Gotham has ever known, and puts his all into it. His performance of a man who's been persecuted his whole life for his mental conditions was immaculate. He brings this charachter to life like no one ever has (Ledger included). Another aspect that can't be swept under the rug is how Impressive of a directing job Phillips did. The fact that he is able to move from directing some of the most renound comedies of all time, to crafting this intense character piece is a credit to his unbelievable skill. The Joker has always been depicted as existing in a world outside of ours, but in this dark drama it's accuratley shown what it would be like if this villain actually existed in the real world. An aspect of this film that's likely not going to get as much attention as it should from general audiences is the score. It's brilliant, and elevates this movie to a whole other level. Don't even hesitate if thinking about watching this movie, do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this expertly conceived world."

The last bits that crumbled Jokers hopes in society was shattering for me to. I expected for him to embrace evil from first scenes knowing how cruel Joker is in comics, but Phoenix painfully suffered for more than I could think and he was fighting until last minutes.

"A character study of a broken man who finally decides to embrace his insanity, that just so happens to be based on a popular comic book character.","'Joker' is not a comic book movie about the origin of a supervillain. Instead, it is a character study of a broken man who finally decides to embrace his insanity, that just so happens to be produced by a recognisable brand. And oh man, how I wish more mainstream films were like this.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a career-defining powerhouse performance as the lead that also arguably redefines the Joker. Whereas the character has previously been portrayed as a criminal mastermind that poses an unstoppable foil to Batman, or in Jared Leto's case, just a joke, Phoenix achieves something I previously thought unfathomable; he makes the character sympathetic.
This Joker, or more precisely, Arthur Fleck, is just an ordinary individual you could easily encounter in the street, who's constantly laughing from the pain of his mere existence. This guy can't catch a break, as he is continuously pushed around and mentally tormented by the world around him, and I could not help but feel pity and remorse for the guy. Even the most subtle nuances Phoenix imposes, such as his changing tone of voice or the way he walks makes his portrayal feel all the more real. When Fleck finally snaps back at the world, I didn't necessarily barrack for him, as his actions are violent and gruesome. However, I was deeply fascinated by how Fleck finally accepts himself as a sociopathic maniac and seeks his own personal justice through the persona of the Joker.
The rest of the supporting cast does a serviceable job, especially Robert De Niro, who hasn't given a performance this lively in years. But Phoenix is the main attraction, and rightfully so. To make the comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker and argue who's better would be pointless. This is a very different portrayal, and I believe the best of both worlds should be embraced.Apart from my ravings about Phoenix, I was very impressed with Todd Phillips' direction, especially considering his previous filmography comprises of sex comedies. Without going too far into spoiler territory, I found the way Phillips chose to tell this story pleasantly surprising. It takes a similar route to something like 'Fight Club' or 'American Psycho', wherein you're unsure whether all the events unfolding on-screen are actually happening in reality or merely the character's imagination. I believe it could be an entirely plausible origin for the Joker in the comics.
Under Phillips' guidance, the majority of the stylistic features are efficiently executed. The muted colour palette and handheld cinematography compliment the film's gritty, realistic tone very well. Hildur Guðnadóttir's score, which is mainly comprised of cellos and other stringed instruments, is hauntingly beautiful. It subtly underscores the Joker's deeper delving into crime and insanity until it crescendos into an anxiety-inducing orchestra when full-on chaos unfolds.My only issue with the film is despite its aims to be a standalone character study, it still dares to shoehorn in tributes and references to the comics. This is only done to a minor extent but it just felt jarring because it did not contribute to the story being told whatsoever.Although I had optimistic hopes for this film, I was still blown away by it. Overall, it was just nice to see a comic book movie that isn't part of a greater cinematic universe that has to set up multiple sequels. Despite all the controversy and criticism swirling around the film's release, I have no doubt over time it will be considered one of the great films of this decade. It is not the perfect comic book movie, but it is rather, the most personal comic book movie I've ever seen."

Confronting and masterful,"I did not know what to expect from this film but what I walked away with was an appreciation of the master of his craft that is Joaquin Phoenix. His gradual metamorphosis into a man disconnected and disassociated with society and its norms is quite simply brilliant. No other actor could have performed this role so well. He is mesmerising. The story is riveting and confronting. The city of Gotham, covered in rubbish and rats is a powerful metaphor for the decay of society and its civility. It is represented as cruel, cold, and degenerating into chaos. There is no reprieve, no hero to save the day. We are exposed to our real selves otherwise hidden by the mask worn by Arthur Fleck. The script, cinematography and score are sublime but Phoenix is the star of this film and must win an Oscar for this role. There is no performance in recent times that compares to it.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

TRAGIC!!!,"Tragic? Yes. That's the first word that came to my mind after leaving the theater watching this movie. This movie gonna show you how tragic his life from beginning to end. How he tried to be good but it eventually became bad, how he tried to maintain his sane mind despite knowing that he doesn't. You gonna feel his struggle, his pain, everything he's going through in the entire movie. And you can understand why he did that despite knowing what he's doing is wrong. For me, this is Joaquin best performances. Is it deserve an Oscar? Absolutely, dude stole the show. well not stole, I mean, he IS the show. 10/102 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

It should have been Commodus (Gladiator) 19 years ago - It'll be Arthur Fleck,"19 years ago, Joaqin Phoenix was robbed of his Oscar but this time it'll be almost impossible to top this performance this year in movies.Phoenix dazzles as this sort of distressed, twisted character that has everything in life going against him. Gotham truly is a cruel city and you end the movie questioning whose side you're on.The links to to Wayne family in this picture also grow the folklore around the Joker-Batman dynamic and you get a greater sense as to why their stories are so intertwined. Really classy touch.Going into this, I felt this 2hour + movie would drag but each and every scene meshes well together, the 1st act makes you grow attached to Arthur as he battles against these demons in his life and the middle & final acts pay your patience with a bunch of twists & turns that you didn't see coming.Worth every second, tightly written script and I can't wait for what DC has in store for us moving forward with these stand alone features. 10/10"
Very interesting take of The Joker,"Not like the other Jokers. Not even the same genre. Instead of a character out of a comic book, this movie portrays him as a regular man who due to societal abandonment slowly descends into madness.Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job of fleshing this character.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,"I have been a film aficionado since as long as I can remember and there is a very select few films I consider to be a masterpiece. On that list is Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and De Palma's Carrie. I have now added Todd Phillip's Joker.
Joaquin Pheonix is incredible and deserves every bit of the Oscar. You forget Pheonix is even in this film because you are so lost in his character. The score is magnificent, that was actually my first thought after watching this film, I thought it would be a crime if Joker didn't win the Oscar for best score.
The way the story ties into the world of Gotham and Batman is extra bonus. You must not forget the setting this movie takes place. Your brain wants to say it's New York City, but it's not. It's Gotham.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

the revolution,"As usual in a case where people leap to extremes, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Joker may make some people who feel marginalized feel more seen and more powerful, and they may act out in response. There are some ugly, self-serving messages in the movie, which is incongruously bent on creating sympathy for Batman's worst enemy and one of DC Comics' most notoriously callous mass murderers and atrocity architects. But love it or hate it, the film does spin up a tempting fantasy of persecution and relief, of embracing nihilism as a means of complete escape from a terrible world1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A haunting drama about one of the greatest villains ever.,"I now think I could've actually seen it while it was playing in cinemas. It was really a somber, dark and disturbing drama film that only got better with every passing second. Joaquin Phoenix has delivered a really outstanding performance, and now I really believe it, having seen it myself! Also, kudos to Todd Phillips for not only directing it brilliantly but also for keeping it less than 2 hours and focusing on just the important parts.Joker is not a superhero film despite being set in the same universe as Batman. It's a very, very dark film that is just hard to ""enjoy"". It's entertaining and captivating, but not in the way you might think. There are no ""wow"" moments in it, and all I could feel was sad at times for Arthur before he became the Joker.Joker is definitely not for you if you're easily turned off by some graphic gore or afraid of disturbing characters. If Todd intended to show us the human beneath the psychopath, I'd say he won, at least for more than half of the movie's duration. Joker has got a strong performance from Phoenix, intense conversations and also some really gorgeous visuals. This film is like a comic book that turns out to be a pretty good character study."
Great insight...,"This movie is at it's best a great insight on how people can be total jerks to other people and how it can affect the ones they act that way towards. It can send some people off the deep end of the world, to to the fact that you nevermind know who, what, when, how, or why the one being bullied, picked on, or shamed by other people in society. I as a parent recommend this movie and I recommend you show it to your children so they can see what can happen to people that are being bullied, or picked on even though this is just one example of what can happen in real life because you never know what effect your actions or words have on others.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A true masterpiece!,"I have notice a lot of people try to draw comprising which (in my view) are completely missed.
This is not a typical DC/superhero type movie. It has nothing to do with Heath Ledger. Would he be proud? Probably. He was brilliant in his own way; however he stared in a DC movie and was your typical Joker (having said that he executed it brilliantly).Now, this movie is different - it is a case study of mental illness. Very deep and heavy going, nonetheless accurate and beautiful in a way. It may as well be considered a movie on its own, without any connections with Gotham, the Joker character, the comic books etc etc. If anything - Taxi Driver (1976) and the King of Comedy (1982) are closer to it than any of the Batman or other DC shows you have seen in the past.Joaquin Phoenix is the best actor of his generation. By far and undoubtedly.
What he did in this film is remarkable. I left the cinema absolutely speechless and moved at the same time.
It is a masterpiece!"
Brilliant and Grim Masterpiece,"In recent years, superhero movies have filled the theaters. This film is unlike any of them. Gritty and realistic it's label as dangerous by the media is well-deserved. This is not because of excessive violence but rather, it is because Arthur Fleck is such a relatable and sympathetic character for so many people.He's not a full-blown psychotic nor is he a calculated psychopath. He is a generally polite, lonely and isolated guy who is in that in between. He's healthy enough to work a job but not healthy enough to thrive or excel. His head is just barely above water, so to speak. His unraveling throughout the movie has less to do with a worsening illness like schizophrenia and more to do with the realistic actions of the society around him.By brilliantly using an accurate depiction of society's actions as a mechanism for his development, it creates a story that rings true. It also creates a deeply sympathetic and almost justified character. Unlike Heath Ledger's agent of chaos Joker, this Joker is fighting against a society that has genuinely failed and mistreated him (and so many others, as the ending shows).All in all, I would say this movie was a masterpiece. It explained a realistic and interesting backstory for a character who is really part of the fabric of American culture. It also highlighted a very overlooked segment of society and looked at real issues that they are facing."

Decline and Fall,"""Joker"" has managed to stir up a whirlwind of controversy, centring partly around the level of violence included but also on the use of ""that song"" on the soundtrack. But putting aside that flurry of commentary, what of the film itself?Man, this is a dark film! It's as much of an anti-superhero film as this year's ""Brightburn"". The Batman legacy has addressed the mental state of the protagonists before (both that of the hero and the villains). Here we have a real study of how a mentally unstable no-hoper can be pushed over the edge by bigotry, carelessness and government cut-backs.Indeed, there is something alarmingly prescient about the movie's plot line, watching this as we (in the UK) are in the month of possible (or as Boris Johnson would say, definite) Brexit madness!After reviewing ""Judy"" I wouldn't be the least surprised if I'd just seen the Best Actress award bagged (by Renée Zellweger). Now, with ""Joker"", surely Joachim Phoenix might bag his first (and well overdue in my book) Oscar. Although nominated before (for ""Gladiator"", ""Walk the Line"" and ""The Master"") he's never won. Here Phoenix's physical transformation into Arthur Fleck is SIMPLY EXTRAORDINARY. And the way he captures the (medically) induced fits of helpless laughter, ending in a sort of choking fit, is brilliant and replicated to a 'T' on multiple occasions.I loved ""You Were Never Really Here"", primarily due to Phoenix's pitch-perfect performance. And ""Joker"" reminded me very much of Lynne Ramsey's film: a disturbed loner, looking after his elderly mother; with violence meted out to wrong-doers. Joe is almost the yin to Arthur Fleck's yang: Joe is an invisible man who is very much present; Arthur is a very visible man who thinks he is invisible. There's even comment by Fleck towards the end of the film that sometimes he thinks he's 'not really there at all'! (A deliberate 'in' joke in reference to that film?)After some pretty poor ""pension grabs"" in recent years, culminating in the appalling career- nadir of ""Dirty Grandpa"" in 2016, Robert De Niro comes good with a fine performance as the idolised but thoughtless and cruel talk-show host Murray Franklin. It's very much a supporting role, but delivered with great aplomb.Also great again is ""Deadpool 2""'s Zazie Beetz (a great trivia answer for an actor with three 'z's' in the name). This angle of the story is deviously clever, and Zazie handles the various twists and turns brilliantly.Movie violence needs to be taken in context to both the film's story and to the movie's certificate. For those expecting a light and fluffy ""Avengers"" style of movie, they might be shocked by what they see. True that the film definitely pushes the boundaries of what I think is acceptable in a UK15-certificate film. ... I suspect there were HEATED discussions at the BBFC after this screening! The violence though seems comparable to some other 15's I've seen: a DIY-store drill scene in ""The Equalizer"" comes to mind.A particularly brutal scene is reminiscent of a climactic scene in ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"", such that Quentin Tarantino might have just cause to appeal his 'UK18' certificate.You might argue about the level of violence that SHOULD be shown in a 15 certificate film. But I think the violence portrayed - given this is in the known context an origin story for a psychopathic killer - is appropriate. I personally found the Heath Ledger's Joker's ""pencil trick"" scene in ""The Dark Knight"" more disturbing, given it was a 12 certificate.I have less sympathy for the inclusion of ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" on the soundtrack.Where ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips does recover some of this respect is in the quality of the script (co-written with Scott Silver) and the direction. It's misdirection without mis-direction! Some of the twists in the plot (no spoilers here!) I did not see coming, and certain aspects of the story (again no spoilers!) are left brilliantly (and chillingly) vague.Sure, it borrows heavily in story-line and mood from Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"". And I was also reminded of 1993's Joel Schumacher flick ""Falling Down"" where Michael Douglas is an ordinary man pushed to the edge and beyond by a series of life's trials. But if you want to criticise a film for ""not being 100% original"" then let's start at the top of the 2019 IMDB listings and keep going! I've also seen comment from some that criticises the somewhat clunky overlay of the Batman back-story into the script. I also understand that view but I didn't personally share it.Elsewhere I would not be surprised if the movie gets garlanded with technical Oscar nominations aplenty come January. The cinematography, by Phillips-regular Lawrence Sher, is exquisite in setting the grimy 70's tone. (I loved the retro Warner Brothers logo too). And both video and sound editing is top-notch. Not forgetting a sonorous cello-heavy soundtrack that perfectly suits the mood. Want to put a bet on which film might top the ""number of Oscar nominations"" list? This might not be a bad choice.Final thoughts: Dark and brooding, with a slow-burn start, this is a proper drama that might make action superhero fans fidgety. But I simply loved it, and would love to carve out the time to give it a re-watch. The Phoenix performance is extraordinary. Will this make my Top 10 of the year? Fingers to head, and pull the trigger.... it's a no-brainer."

Oscar-worthy. A very human movie.,"I saw Joker last night at the Studio Movie Grill in Marietta, GA. There were two police officers on hand, but it was a very calm and peaceful evening. The theater was completely full and there were a lot of people who clapped and even cried during the movie. However, not once did I ever fear for my safety or my life. Never once did I feel or sense there was going to be anarchy, chaos, or a riot after the movie. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE. Just like any other action movie with guns, violence, and killing in it (F&F, John Wick, etc., etc.). All in all, I thought 2019's Joker was a great movie. It was a very human movie. It show's a man who's been broken down, beaten, lied to, and mistreated his whole life. A man who feels isolated, alone, unwanted, and unloved in a system and society completely against him. Because of the way the film is portrayed and because of the incredible talent of Joaquin Phoenix, you can empathize and sympathize with his character. You feel sorry for him and all of the incredibly unjust bs he goes through. You may even find yourself wishing you could help him. Because of that, you can understand his descent into madness and the reason behind all of his characters' actions (not that they were wholly just or correct by any means). It gave depth and insight into the Joker's and Batman's (Bruce Wayne's) relationship and their history as a prequel movie. The ONLY things I can think of why certain groups of people might be against this movie are: 1) They don't like DC Comics or Batman. 2) They don't like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. 3) They're afraid that the movie will empower self-righteous people who are fed-up with a corrupt government into taking action and causing Anarchy (like in the movie). 4) They think that grown adults don't have any common sense and/or general reasoning skills, can't distinguish between reality and fiction, and cannot control their own thoughts and actions."
Absolutely Brilliant! Exceeded all expectations!,"Joaquin Phoenix + no CGI + superb character development = A Masterpiece...

A masterpiece depiction of a dystopian society,"11 years ago I watched The Dark Knight and enthralled by the fact that how a person can act as so naive.. How a person does not suffer any qualms of conscience for the horrible things he has done... How a person sees the cruel and brutal things as a joke... 11 years later I got the answer... Absolute ingenious direction and screenplay... Scorcseseian touches makes it more cinematic... 80's flavours and retro vibes takes us right into the dark alleys of Gotham and the 70's depression... This movie proves that the personality/origin of a character is greatly affected by childhood abuse. Todd Phillips has done quite a nice depiction of it. The highly unsettling tones and real life situation makes one really uncomfortable at times... Sometimes we see ourselves in the big shoes of the clown prince of Crime. The great toxicity, graphic novel easter eggs, really dark background, brutal violence makes it an R-rated without showing any sexually explicit materials.
Last but not the least is the character acting of Joaquin Phoenix. The 4 sets of laughs consisting of Pretentious Laugh , Sarcastic Laugh , Happy laughs and the most unnerving laughs from emotional outbursts originated from his mother's abuse in the childhood gives him a complex personality and adds new depths. Oscar-worthy portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix.... Kudos!!!"
Joker's totally worth the hype.,"It's the pictorial representation of how a society makes a serial killer out of a mentally ill person. It shows how some people look at the disabled. Not all of it is exact and after all it's a movie... About the people talking about it affecting mindsets of the audience and leaving a negative impact, it all depends on the interpretation of the viewer. It is really violent and bold. But I never ever think that it will affect people in a bad way. So we should really enjoy it as a film, there have been films that are more violent and they should've not even released...
About the crew, Phoenix is wonderful, scary and really really unpredictable. Todd Phillips has done a great job. Great supporting cast.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The importance of the message in this film when it comes to mental illness, neglect, and abuse of those who just want happiness and equal-treatment is absolutely paramount and incredibly true to every day life in this struggling world.

Instant Classic,"This film deserves every award available. Joaquin for best actor because he is absolutely brilliant. People throw that around, I know, but he really is. The writing/directing/cinematography/music all of it. It's never slow, nothing is ""filler"", everything has purpose, and it cooks along, building and building. I walked out of the theater and wanted to go right back in and watch it again.Joker is in a class of it's own even outside of the superhero genre. This film would completely stand on it's own with the story it tells (change a couple of names). As a part of the Batman legacy it adds a richness and depth to the overall story of Batman, even though specific to this character. It will fit seamlessly for someone who purchases this for their collection.No, it is not a movie for young children. Neither was The Godfather. Some stories are not meant for children, that doesn't mean adults shouldn't see a grown-up explanation with Joker that you actually have to think about. Heaven forbid we have a movie that makes us think about anything. Kids will see enough of Joker in Batman movies.It's not a shallow 'waste a couple hours'. This is a thinking person's cinematic triumph. There is a severity in here that the Batman story deserves, and that this character really does benefit from. This is the Joker movie that needed to be made. When I say severity it's not the violence, there are many violent movies/Tv shows. The severity is in the relationships, the character development, how do we process the things the film forces us to think about and feel. Things are not black and white.As far as violence I've seen worse on TV shows. The Walking Dead, Vikings, Game of Thrones, and more. The violence in Joker is not there without reason, it serves a purpose to the story. I can bring up videos on the internet of things that have shown up on the news. There is nothing wilder in Joker than what you see on tv without the pixels (I'm trying to leave out spoilers). Some of the media regarding this, and reaction (whomever it was that walked out) is ridiculous and overblown. It is R rated. The news should be R rated. So just consider this a documentary and get over it or don't watch.I congratulate the writers/director and Joaquin Phoenix. Anyone who worked on this project too. Bravo and thank you, really.PS
I so admire Heath Ledger's portrayal. I thought nothing would ever touch that. Well don't even try to compare is what I would say now. Heath's film has a different purpose and is in a different time in Joker's life. I don't think they can be compared but they are both powerful. They are complementary rather than competitive. Put Heath's Joker completely out of your head for this. I don't think it's even fair to compare the two now. I'm also pretty sure if Heath Ledger were still alive he would be ecstatic over Joaquin's performance."
Marvellous movie,First of all its a very intense movie. You can hardly take so much in one sitting.They want you to behave normally while having a mental condition you cant. As long as you pretend to be kind in a ruthless society no one gives a damn.

It has a filing of a real movie, unseen in decades. It is real art form, not just something to kill your time, or it is just a good movie. It is beyond that. Simply monumental piece of art, that will be studied hopefully in the future. I hope we will see new era of quality cinema, but this is so good , dont think anyone will match this in next years.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
JOKER IS A MUST SEE!,"Masterpiece from beginning to end. From the cinematography to the acting.. It's extremely relatable and filled with necessary lessons and messages. The exploration of mental illness forces viewers to have a deeper understanding for not only Arthur Fleck/Joker, but people in OUR society. Joaquin's performance was impeccable as always. This movie was so mesmerizing and had me on an emotional rollercoaster. I didn't want it to end! Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Can't wait to see it again and again!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Fascinating,"The movie takes you on a journey to the inside door's of our society seen from the eyes of one of it's victim.
Even if you are not a fan of the joker, the movie captivates you by showing how little you think of the world you live in and how proud you are at the end when you finnnaly change the ""the world"" you thought it was your home, even if you didn't respected the rules.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"A timely, relevant and powerful film reflecting society's dark side.","WOW! Where do I even begin? Not for such a long time has a film had such a profound affect on me. I can honestly say that ""Joker"" (2019) is perhaps the best film I have ever seen. The commentary on class, politics and mental health has never been more relevant than it is today. The film is an incredible character study in to the psyche and origins of one of comic books' greatest ever villains. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the accompanying score and soundtrack absolutely perfect. I literally couldn't look away from the screen from beginning to end and Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal in the role, and every bit of his performance is Oscar worthy as we watch mental health and unfortunate circumstances propel Arthur Fleck in to the downward spiral that makes him become The Joker. The script is full of powerful moments that director Todd Phillips brings to life perfectly. This is definitely Joker's movie but it also ties in to the Batman mythology perfectly. Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy also offer a great turn in supporting roles. Is the movie as hyper-violent has critics make out. No. Is it a gritty, realistic, and uncomfortable reflection of society? Absolutely.
I can't wait to watch this again. Perfect movie. 10/10."
Absolutely amazing. The best film I've watched in years.,"Honestly, I didn't even want to go see this film. I had no interest in it whatsoever. I've never been a huge fan of the leading man, I wasn't thrilled about seeing any new film since the last three I walked out on. I walked out on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Ad Astra, and Spider-Man: Far from Home, the first two bored the heck out of me. JOKER, on the other hand, was intense.....I-N-T-E-N-S-E!!! Joaquin Phoenix played his role of a lifetime to perfection. Possibly the most impressive acting I've seen by anyone, in any film, ever! There is NO WAY that he isn't going to get the Best Leading Man award at the next Oscar show, no way.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A descent into madness,"This is brilliant, but disturbing film-making.
Joaquin Phoenix gives an amazing performance as a man being beaten into madness, rather than heading there under his own steam. As such, the film treads a delicate line between feeling pity for Arthur Fleck (Joker), being repulsed and disturbed by him and rooting for him to succeed in his twisted ambitions.
When watching this film, pay attention to Fleck's body language. Observe how, in the comedy club, he doesn't laugh when every else does, and laughs when no-one else does. It is this subtle attention to detail which raises the level of this film.
If this wasn't a ""superhero"" based movie, it would be guaranteed awards. But coming from comic book source material, I suspect that it will be largely ignored come awards season.
Go and see this movie. It is definitely getting crazier out there!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joker - an instant comic book classic,"Joker (2019)
Directed by Todd Phillips
Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Zazie Beets, and Robert De Niro.
5/5I saw this film when it came out in theaters, feels kinda late after all these people saw it at the film festivals. I'm just gonna write this review now. This film was what I came in expecting. A gritty, gory (not that gory tbh) Martin Scorsese style movie (clearly to the likes of classics such as The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver), featuring Joaquin Phoenix as the second best on screen Joker - Heath Ledger is undefeated in my book. Joaquin definitely deserves an Oscar. The film was 2 hours, but my god, what a rollercoaster, it flew FAST! Similar to the Dark Knight trilogy, this was NOT a typical superhero/villain film. In fact it was anything but. You could look at this film and remove any Batman/Wayne/Joker details and it still feels like an intense movie focusing on a deeply depressed man. Wow. Just wow. I was speechless after watching it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Joker is the best movie of 2019,"I was in need for a movie like this and I didn't even know.
The theme is so pertinent and important and to all the people who fear this movie is going to incite violence, I think it's the other way. It teaches us we need to be more empathetic and pay more attention to the person next to us and how we, as a system, fail continuously to protect people.
Everything is perfect since Phoenix's performance (Ledger must be so proud) to the superb job of Todd Phillips, where every detail is thought and well-placed.
I highly recommend you to watch the movie but, most importantly, to think about it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
10/10 for everything,"Oh my....and for years Heath Ledgers version of Joker was my favourite, up until now, I thought Joaquin Phoenix version was as equally if not just about marginally better, a very worthy Oscar winning performance, he was outstandingly brilliant from start to finish, and the story filled in a lot of early story arc for the batman movies, I hope the director Todd Phillips and Joaquin get to continue this story and bring Batman into the fold that would be epic1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

brilliant!!! One of the best movies of this decade!,"I created an imdb account only to give this movie a 10/10 because I really disagree with the negative critics. A brilliant, dark, disturbing and moving masterpiece of a movie that makes you think and question your definitions of good and bad. Unlike the opinion of the critics, the fact that the movie uses the character of the joker to connect a comic personality to the complex development of mental illness and to hold a mirror in front of the problems of today's society is exactly what makes this movie so brilliant to me.
And then there is the outstanding and brilliant acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It feels like he put 200% of himself into this role and he portrays the highly complex levels of mental illness and the character development of Arthur Fleck slowly becoming the Joker in an outstanding way. Brilliant performance that truly felt like art, this is what real acting should be like. Hands down deserves to win the Oscar for this!

Joker and Joaquin Phoenix justify the need of The Dark Knight,"Joker is the character sketch of Arthur Fleck, a young man aspiring to be a stand up comedian but suffering from multiple psychological and physical disorders. One of his serious shortcomings is that when he is nervous, he laughs uncontrollably, thus giving those around him the impression of ridicule and impunity. His strange mannerisms add to the complexity leading to Arthur becoming the cynosure of social ostracism and wholesome rejection, including physical excesses. He lives with his mother Penny, a debilitated woman also with mental issues. Arthur's life is one of an almost invisible and reclusive existence, something that's not acceptable to him. The social repulsion takes its final toll when the psychologist treats him with utter contempt and cuts off his medication. The situation sends him spiralling down into a psychological spin resulting in a social revolt and unbridled violent crimes that he has no remorse for.That's the birth of Joker for you which will connect with The Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne. Joker is an extremely volatile and complex character for whom your heart may cry out for sympathy in a moment and almost simultaneously look for a social rationale for his return to socially acceptable behaviour. Joaquin Phoenix has gotten under the skin of the character, yearning for sympathy, yet loathsome and abhorrent. Such maniacal is his demonstration of the nadir of his existence that the glorification of which has perhaps no comparison in modern times. Joker justifies the need of a vigilante for the return of control over Gotham, reeling from riotous behaviour of the less fortunate. The intensity of the character, physical nuances, volatility and subterfuge related histrionics of Joaquin Phoenix are in a class seldom witnessed in cinema - he pretty much is the prelude to Heath Ledger's Joker, almost seamlessly justifying the character. This rendition does deserve the standing ovation it got and is worth its weight in gold. Take a bow director Todd Phillips!"

"Psychological, Terrifying And...Dark","After I left the movie theater, I was trying to ellaborate a thought about the movie and I finally realized, after a while, that I had so many thoughts about it that I couldn't even choose what to think about and that is the true power of a masterpiece movie!About Todd Phillips... Have mercy, how is it possible passing from a triology of comedy to a very psychological, terrifying, dark and twisted kind of movie? The fact that Todd Phillips embraced the project with open arms, asking for script reviews and trying to define a production model identical as we saw in King of Comedy or Taxi Driver from Martin Scorsese is gratifying! Todd Phillips is a master not just because he did what he did, but because he picked the most loved villain in comic history and he broked all the rules about following the origins story. Instead, he created an alternative character, explored his origins and placed it on a broken society that can actually be seen as the true villain of this story!.Joaquin Phoenix ( and I never get tired out saying this ) is an excellent, genius and a phenomenon actor. After minus fifty-two pound of weight, discouvering is body afterwards ( related to his movements on the movie ) and still play a character like this... It's is something we can not just say ""Eh, good job"", because good job are two killer words, what we need to say is ""You were epic, you did what you did and now... you are a legend!"" Brand new body movements, a brand new laughing is introduced, a great interpretation of the character... what can I say more? He is a legend! He introduced to us a poor man that lived with his mother in a cheap apartement, having a mental disorder that made him laugh in a very uncontrollaby way, full of pain when everything he wanted was...bring joy to the world and put on a happy face, turning Arthur Fleck into a very psychological, terrifying and dark man, known as...Joker!Congrats to everybody that made this film possible!"
Best origin film,Great origin story.... Was well worth the watch.... References or easter eggs throughout was good... And finally a film that portrays behind the joker and not just batman's villain we all now and heard the same story over again... Great stand alone film...think people expected the same thing as usual you see in dc or marvel films and follow up to what we all now... But it's not... Expands beyond that... And really need to appreciate it for psychological and emotional issues that is what becomes apparent of how and why arthur becomes the joker...1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

An acting and directing masterpiece,"In my humble opinion, Joker is one of the best movies of 2019 and of the decade. This psychological thriller has clearly shown the transformation Arthur Fleck has gone through. All he wanted was to get accepted into the society, but the lack of this acceptance has gradually taken its toll on him and on his transformation into the Joker, what a journey he's been through. Superb and award-winning performance by Joaquin Phoenix coupled by amazing work on directing, cinematography and soundtrack.

A TRIUMPH,"JOKER is an absolute triumph of modern-day cinema. A depressing, exciting, horrifying, morbid, sad and multilayered masterpiece featuring one of the most riveting und heart-wrenching performances by an actor you're ever going to have the pleasure (and honour!) of witnessing on the big screen. Another (and perhaps the very best!) career-defining role by Joaquin Phoenix whose unquestionable talent is only rivaled by his 100% dedication to the craft of being one of the very best in what he does. And what he does in this film could only be described as a deep dive into the depths of one troubled soul and its tense relationship with a violent and uncaring world. Like Arthur's own reality. A reality that could chew and then spit you out like a tasteless fly. It clearly suggests to us that everyone's sanity has his/her limits, so when we pass beyond them and stop pretending that everything's "" ""eventually going to be alright"", breaking the conventional artificial rules becomes the new norm. When everyone denies you love and legitimate care, you hit them back with as much hatred and anger as possible. If we are to live in a jungle, then one should start playing by its crude ancient rules. Or at least that's what the Joker wants us to think, because after all - he's telling us the story... from HIS perspective, right? But does that change the fact that his world, his dark and filthy Gotham City seems so awfully familiar???Todd Phillips' Arthur Fleck/Joker... You will like him. You will sympathize with him. You will cry for him. You will be scared of him. You will hate him. But most importantly - you will... understand him. And that may just as well be one of the most cathartic moments in your life as a moviegoer... and nevertheless as a member of a SOCIETY that unfortunately is still way too effective in creating monsters that no one can control. Monsters that we refuse to take the responsibility for and who may one day force us (in the worst case scenario) to pay the bitter price for our negligence.A DEFINITE MUST-SEE!!! This film is an event and Joaquin's performance is one for the ages. It will definitely go down in history as one worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Brando's Don Vito Corleone, Daniel Day-Lewis' Daniel Plainview, Jack Nicholson's McMurphy and Heath Ledger's own version of that iconic character in every single ""All-Time Greatest Character Portrayals"" list you can get your hands on. Arthur's character arc is absolutely not the only ace that this film has up its sleeve: the mesmerizing soundtrack by Hildur Guðnadóttir, the captivating visual storytelling achieved though Lawrence Sher's masterful cinematographic approach, the unexpected re-imagining of Thomas Wayne - there're so many more things to love and contemplate about after seeing that amazing masterpiece. You can be sure of it ;)12 out 10 stars :)"
A Masterpiece. A love letter. The truth.,"Have you ever felt that movies of present era are too tasteless? Doesn't appeal to the emotion of an individual? Cannot portray a moral value without cringe? Actors involved do acting which is unrelatable? Then Joker is the movie for you.For me, the Joker is a love letter , a magnumopus art which appeals to the heart of people. It's like the director was in my mind the whole time and gave me exactly what I wanted.The acting is above oscar level. If Phoenix doesn't get an oscar for this then maybe oscars doesn't deserve him. His laugh,his pain,his helplessness is soo real I wonder how can any human act like this! I cried twice while I was in hall just because I couldn't see how selfish we humans are and how certain people have worst day of their lives just because we can't share few kind words them.The reason why it so special is because it doesn't have the same hero,heroine hero wins everything is good ending. Here the actual story is shown. There is no hero but only villains which prey on the innocent. Call me cynical but I was glad Arthur killed those people and brought chaos. I am literally tired of people thinking that there is a happy ending in real world for people who are suffering. There is no happy ending and there is no guy who cares about you.Dialogues like "" What is with you people?"", ""Why is everyone so rude?"", ""Don't call my mother that."", ""I don't want to make you feel awkward."", are soo real it makes you think that many people are living a lonely depressing life just because we can't share few kind words but would rather supress such people to impress our friends who are equally messed up.Joker is the best movie I have ever seen in all my life and I doubt if any other movie will ever surpass it.I know that it doesn't have any CGI fights, superhero,happy ending for society, beautiful heroine or comedy. But what it does have is realistic acting, acknowledging moral values without element of forcing it upon us , the reality of society rather than 'everything is allright' and THIS IS HOW A MOVIE SHOULD BE.What I am trying to say is, if you have a heart then you can't help but agree with the joker."
A Psycologicaly thrilling look on society and the tale of a broken man,"There have been many Joker's, Mark Hammil, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, Jack Nicholson and many more who have all thrown their hat in the ring and tried their hand at portraying the greatest villain in comic history, many were good but none come close to Joaquin Phoenix performance of the classic villain. However, before I get too far ahead of myself I should address the fact there may be a couple spoilers in this review so be warned (I'll do my best to keep them to a minimum).First of all, going back to what I previously stated, Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is nothing but perfection. He truly personifies a villain created by society's greatest failures and shortcomings. However, where his depiction truly shines is the stark contrast between this Joker and almost every other Joker. None have ever come close to this level of pure emotion in the character, even seemingly small things like his physical appearance; the rugged hair, the protruding spine, the inhumanly white skin, all this adds to the effect of pure psychological terror.Slightly straying away from Phoenix, I'd like to focus on the character of Joker in this movie (To reiterate-possible spoilers ahead). As I previously subjected, this Joker is extremely different to any other Joker we've seen before, mainly down to the raw emotions we see from him, of which we've never really seen the likes of. This movie delves deep into his relationship with the waynes, his mother and the rest of Gotham as a whole, he was a man trying to be normal who was utterly betrayed by society.Further continuing my point about Gotham, I'd like to commend the production team for making sure every set was as accurate to what Gotham would look like as they could make it, it really drives home how awful Gotham truly is. From the start we see how much of a wreck Gotham is and how dysfunctional of a society it is. There have been very few pieces of media that relates to this level of 'awfulness', from the top of my head, i'd probably name the Arkham games or maybe the telltale series but neither came close to showing how bad of a situation that Gotham was in, riots on the streets, litter spewed everywhere and poverty run amuck. Prime conditions for festering hatred and birthing psychopaths.There are so few flaws with this film, you could count them with a single hand. However I feel like many may be disappointed by the ending, it's a little anticlimactic but still leaves an interesting possibility to be theorised.But now I think I'll stop myself anymore said and the film would be well and truly spoiled for you, so in conclusion: Go watch this film! It deserves all the praise it gets and more and I hope this is an outlet for us to see more films where we look from the 'bad guy' perspective and delve into their inner thoughts and feelings.Keep being awesome, peace out."

Absolutely gripping,"I had concerns it had the potential to be slow and/or ultra violent, however this movie is neither. It's a masterpiece in character study filled with this beautifully ironic comedy - the kind of comedy that occurs when you are trying so hard and life just smacks you in the face in the worst of ways. It's so much more than just the ""making of a killer"", but more so the perfect storm of mental illness and a failing mental health system, combined with a series of traumatic events, father issues, failure of professional success (thusly the fear that he will always be a failure), and the trials of near daily bullying, simply as a result of being eccentric.There is violence, but I've witnessed 80/90's action movies that make this pale in comparison.You will be glued to the screen.. not a single person got up to go to the restroom or get a refill....well, this maybe an exaggeration as I was so focused on the movie that it was as if I was transported to a time when movies were legit.Please see this movie."

Unexpected creative genius!,"I loved it!!!Storyline: A backstory for The Joker has never been done on the big screen before and I can honestly say I was skeptical about it because his story would have to be complex and nearly impossible to tell especially if you don't have an actor who's capable of portraying the complexity of the character, but I was pleasantly surprised with every aspect of this film from the original storyline that gives him a different story from his initial backstory in the comics and his return story when he was reborn in the first Robin. This story incorporates all of the issues of today and today's society that have always existed but is being told during the time of the 70s/80s. It's also very modern and foretelling of a future that everyone should expect if things continue on the current path. The dismissal of mental health being a reality that is usually ignored and handled by overmedicating is a huge issue that's addressed. The crippling economy and the separation of the wealth classes and how it affects us all is also covered. Abuse of almost every form is discussed and the effects of it are clearly seen. His outcome was predictable considering the tragedy of his life.Thomas Wayne was everything I thought the real Thomas Wayne would've been. He's a hero to his young son because he didn't live long enough for Bruce to see who he really was and become corrupted morally by him, but Thomas is an entitled, privileged monster who judges the common man far too harshly and refuses to see that he's a part of the problem.Cast: Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most underrated actors and even though I've always thought that he is one of the few actors who actually becomes the character he's playing, I can also admit that I didn't think he had what it takes to not only play the role of the Joker, but also be the best version of the Joker outside of the animated version voiced by Mark Hamill.No one can play the crazy mother better than Frances Conroy.Overall I gave it a 10. It was a breath of fresh air to see something honest come out of Hollywood. DC comics are dark. All of the movies should be rated R for the most part to capture the true nature of the story of the characters. Hopefully this movie means DC movies are being reborn and retold with more authenticity and accuracy that compliments their darker nature.It's a must see."
Who's laughing now ?,"It's been a while since a real and good movie was released. The last 2-3 years were a succession of 'so so' movies with no depth, PC ones and of course $200 millions budget Avengers and others garbage fest(the 1st iron man and avengers were decent).
Joker is a real movie, entertaining, making you think, and of course creating a wide range of emotions: disgust, fear, empathy, angriness, joy, sadness... I doubt that Phillips voluntarily implanted all these concepts but rather try to describe a story that is real in a sense and so it is relatable.
I saw some critics and I don't get them. Do they know what movies are about ? They just take shortcut, have no clue about societal issues and how assassins and dictators rise. Most of them focus on how the movie tries to make you empathic with psychopaths; it does not and the 4th murder confirms this. It just tells us that society makes us good or bad and than humans are complex and fragile. So ignore these joker of a critic.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A masterpiece that is created in decades,"From the beginning of the movie, i felt so attached with the character. I could see, it was portraying a lot of people's lives. I would see the violent part as it is, we should address it as reality rather than some fake looking acting. The movie is already 18+. So, talking about the violence doesn't make sense.One of the best pictures of this decade which a lot of people would empathize.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
1 of if not the best comic film in a long time,I've been waiting for this film since it was 1st announced and I'm happy to say that it surpasses all of my expectations. Had to watch it twice to fully process everything. Joaquin Phoenixs' performance was just incredible. I didn't think he could come close to Heath Ledgers performance. Not saying he surpasses Ledgers performance or anything. But this interpretation of the clown prince of crime is an absolute joy to watch as you get to actually see how bad of a day he had to fully lose his mind. Expertly directed by Philips....a must watch.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
Not Your Classic Joker,"The title of my review sounds negative, but the stars will show otherwise.
This movie is a stand-alone film, and this joker will not be making an appearance in any other film, it's just simply an origin story. Aside from The Killing Joke, very little is said of the joker's origins in the comic world, so this movie was able to take the stand up comedian + mental breakdown (albeit, a slow one is this case) and begin to show how the joker became The Joker.
Best thing about this character? He's always been vague, so in all the renditions of the Joker they're all specific to the person portraying them. Where all The Batman's watch other Batmen and try to play as closely to that as you can, all the actors that play the Joker BECOME the Joker, making them each so unique. It really is what began the idea that the Joker isnt always the same person, but an idea and a figure that keeps inspiring new ones.
***Back to my review of the actual movie***
Don't go in expecting Nicholson or Ledger (but just be glad it isn't Leto's version), but it's beautifully done. It's not straight out of that comics because they wanted it too feel real, and it did just that. Why do you think people are becoming worried of the negative impacts it may have on some viewers? Because mental health is a real thing, and where the Joker May be an extreme consequence of that, it's still an issue that becomes more prevalent everyday. It blurs the lines on whether Joker is a hero or a villain because it's an ORIGIN story. He spends the movie trying to figure out who he is, and it's at the end that he shows it, and that portrayal is spot on. Joker spends his days reminding Batman of how similar they are, and that similarity really resonates with you in this film.
I'm just going to stop now because surely nobody will read my review all the way through after all the rabbit trailing thing I did."

The most important film of this decade.,"Joker answers a question any Batman fan will inevitably ask:We have Bruce Wayne's history in Batman Begins (which was excellent) but what about his nemesis, the Joker? Here you have it, folks. And it pulls no punches in explaining how a deranged sociopathic serial killer comes to be.Joker has a few laugh out loud moments, but for the most part it's a very dark, tragic tale of odds that are almost impossible to overcome and the inevitable consequences of isolation, loneliness, abuse... The very worst our world has to offer.Joker won't rake in the big bucks at the box office. Rather, 50 years from now it will be talked about as the most culturally important film of this decade.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joker: A Deeply Unsettling Character Study About Social Isolation and Mental Illness,"Todd Phillip's Joker, a standalone film within the DC Universe, is a tragic and haunting cinematic masterpiece. A deeply unsettling film that belongs to the bygone era of the 70's and 80's. A type of film that Hollywood has since neglected in favour of producing big blockbuster franchises.Joker is not a film that everyone will enjoy and it was not produced for that purpose. Some will be put off by the dark bleak tone and the subject matter under discussion. While others will dislike the film for being extremely unconventional, especially for a character born within a superhero universe.Joker is a complex art house film that is essentially a psychologically driven character study of Arthur Fleck (also eventually known as Joker). It provides an insight into the brutal reality of social isolation, societal fragmentation and mental illness at a time when society lacks basic elements of empathy and humanity for its inhabitants.It is inspired and influenced by late 70's and early 80's art house films like Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Mean Streets, Network and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.In order for it to be widely accessible it has been dressed up in the garb of a mainstream Hollywood film. Yet, make no mistake, Joker is a piece of cinematic art that we have been deprived of for decades. A type of film that has been missing for a generation due to Hollywood's obsession with maintaining the status quo.Without spoiling the film, Joaquin Phoenix plays the titular character Joker, who turns in one of the most astonishing performances ever captured on film. He presents us with a portrayal of a failed stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck in Gotham City during the early 80's, who from the very first moment he is depicted on screen is shown struggling with mental illness. Over the next 2 hours, through no fault of his own, we are provided with a brutally powerful depiction of his apparent descent into madness.The film challenges and forces its audience to face themes they will find extremely uncomfortable. As a society we have made a habit of brushing our problems under the carpet. Joker not only lifts that rug, but it pulls it right from under our feet by showing us the brutal horror of what it means to be broken by society in every way imaginable.It is a film that is essentially about our ability to deal with trauma, our need for compassion and our capacity for destruction borne from the way we are treated by society. It is a story that should resonate with us on a personal level, about our position in society and how we deal with our own fragility and vulnerabilities. This includes our need to be accepted by others around us.The beauty of art house cinema is that it can be interpreted in a number of ways. However, several commentators have attempted to weaponise the film as a piece of political propaganda by interpreting it through the prism of the far right, Brexit, the Me-Too movement and Donald Trump. Sorry to disappoint those who choose to do so, but the film is not about any of those issues. This is something the protagonist makes very clear throughout the film.Rather, it points the camera inwards and presents us with a glimpse of our own insecurities. It highlights a personal and uncomfortable truth that no matter what we choose to identify as we are solitary human beings born on a planet which does not care whether we live or die, because the show must go on.Ever since we were children we have always been taught that if we live decent lives, are good to others then good will be done to us. But as adults, despite how uncomfortable it may be for many to admit, we have come to the painful realisation that in the societies we inhabit this is untrue.For many like Arthur, living in such an immoral and depraved world has led to perverse life changing experiences being inflicted upon them in their childhood that have carried on into adulthood through the manifestation of serious mental illnesses.Some social commentators have expressed how the film mocks mental health issues. It does nothing of the sort. Rather it shines a light on the burden placed on those who suffer from these serious conditions and the indifference in which they are treated by society. Arthur sums it up perfectly in the film when he says ""the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't"".Despite what critics and some who want to use the film as a political tool have said about the visceral and raw violence depicted on screen, Joker is not a film about violence. Rather, it is about our need as a society to be empathetic. One act of kindness could be everything to someone suffering in isolation. The violence we see on screen is essentially a metaphorical response to the brutal feelings of isolation that exist when one is inflicted with serious mental illness. Being trapped by your own mind with no escape can lead many people suffering from mental illness to commit acts of violence on themselves, even in a non literal sense, especially in the way they perceive themselves.If anyone's take away from the film is to highlight the violence we briefly see on screen, then they have failed to understand that the film is screaming at us that violence is not the answer to our problems. In fact, more abuse and violence is inflicted upon Arthur than anyone else in the film and it is through this affliction that we begin to see the world around him for what it truly is.Ever since the film was lauded with the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice Film Festival it has been met with controversy. Some have claimed that Joker leaves the viewer with a morally ambiguous message that will encourage incels, a trait recognised in Arthur, to commit murder.This is a predictable scaremongering media violence trope we have heard for decades about films by politicians and societal leaders to cover up their own failings that have led to the immoral and depraved society we inhabit today.Those reading this review may have been put off watching the Joker due to the subject matters under discussion, but this is why it is imperative that each and every one of us watches this film. By seeing the true depths of how our society can unintentionally or intentionally push ordinary people to the edge of insanity, maybe it will force us to reflect on our own expressions of compassion and empathy."
Absolutely breathtaking,"In short this film is absolutely incredible. Everything from the cinematography to the score is perfect. Phoenix is a revelation and is a definite Oscar contender.

Watch It!!!,"Alright, so this is my first review but I felt like I had to talk about it. I'm 14 years old and went to see this with my friend. Now, I consider myself quite mature for my age in terms of movies, so I knew that this wasn't gonna be the usual comic book movie but goddamn was this a pleasant surprise. Firstly, the acting in this movie is incredible, especially Joaquin Phoenix. The cinematography is also great and the music is phenomenal. I've read some criticism around the movie surrounding the fact that it borrows stuff from Taxi Driver and King of comedy. I can't comment on king of comedy as I have not seen it yet, but I have seen Taxi Driver so I can comment on that. I can see the influence, but I don't think it borrows that much from it. The basic plot setup is the same, but the execution is so different so I wouldn't compare the two. All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough.10/10 would forget the snacks I brought with me again1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Fantastic performance and a mirror for our society!,"Joaquin Phoenix finally has done his masterpiece and is by far the Oscar favorite.But that is not the whole story of the movie. It is a mirror for our current society, where people only blame the terror attacker, without looking behind the stories of them! Nobody turns mad for no reason! In the Western world it is mostly bullying, in poorer countries suppression by other nations. Nobody cares for communities anymore. That's why we sympathize with he mad joker and it is amazing, that his story has finally been told to the fullest. Who can blame him for finally get a cheer in his life even when it meant, that he had to kill his bullies?!10/101 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

This movie is a masterpiece really gives an insight into the Jokers mind while remaining very emotional throughout this psychological thriller,"Let's just say Joaquin Phoenix has done a remarkable job as playing the Joker, where he really does make The Joker as disturbing as he is always meant to be. We first start off seeing Arthur Fleck (The Joker) working as a clown for this company that sends people dressed up as clowns to different places in the city to entertain customers. We learn from the start that Arthur has schizophrenia he was placed on a psychiatric mental hospital temporarily in the past, where now he is out trying to fit into society on seven different medications while seeing a councillor in the meantime to try and get better to feel something positive in his life. You feel sorry for his character through his descent into madness as you learn all the hardships that he has been through, like been beaten as a child to still being taken the mick out of and beaten while being disregarded as an adult, which makes me think he wants society, but society does not want him to exist with his horrible condition. You will find yourself on an emotional journey in this film really does bring The Joker into a humane light while also being Psychotic with the reasons behind that. He also reverts to like a mind palace when he is unsure or someone is being horrible to him, which it can be either thinking that he is somewhere or with a particular person when his not or his uncontrollable laughter that calms him down as it is kind on his go to defence mechanism with his schizophrenia to try to make himself feel calmer. When we see him dancing down the stairs it gives him a humane happy side showing that he is still a human not just a mad killing monster that we always have perceived him to be, therefore he really does need help when people just ignore him and cast him off as kind of a waste of space in society. Arthur does not know how to react to everyday situations is a struggle for him, so killing someone in defence to him if they have really wronged or mocked him is fair game, even though we feel anger inside in our everyday lives that can be relatable we know how to make sense of our feelings knowing right from wrong with certain levels, which Arthur with his condition he cannot really comprehend. Even though these rich guys are horrible people and are very mean to him, which we can see Arthur has a point to the fact that if someone like them been killed people would be out for blood, compared to if someone like him had been killed they would just be passed by and ignored like street rubbish, therefore something needs to be changed. Arthur as The Joker he is trying to invoke a movement against people who think less of him and are mean to him even though the way he is going about it is the completely wrong way to go about it. We see people are being killed on the streets as a result of his killings to force change, where a peaceful campaign could have been more a lot effective in the long run instead of just madness and chaos. Overall, I would give this film a ten out of ten I defiantly recommend you watching it really does play with your mind it is a psychological thriller that can be scary to have you on the edge of your seat, therefore well done to the phenomenal acting along with the cinematography that really sets the scene for the film. Just to bear in mind that this is a stand alone film based on DC Characters, so some of the plot of how it fits in does not make sense, however that is how it is meant to be portrayed to give the shocking reality that raises awareness about these issues as they are real life people with these mental problems that they should be helped not ignored by so many people."

Great Movie,"After watching the new Todd Phillip's movie ""Joker"", I think that this is a great movie about society and its aftermath, but as a film about the iconic DC comic book antagonist, it is rather empty because this is no joker pre-history, but rather an arbitrary director's way of attracting viewers to the cinema thanks to its intriguing title. Therefore, it should be viewed as a social drama, not a comic book screening.For those who want to know how this hero came about, I suggest you read ""The Killing Joke"" or at least watch a cartoon showing the birth of Joker.P.S. I hope Joaquin Phoenix gets an Oscar.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
I still need to see it a couple of times,"The story is so plausible that sometimes it hurts to know that yes, that would happen and yes, that man would be in a lot of pain.

He is grotesque, yes, horrible, yes, but soo humane, you really get to see his point of view and at the end..you kinda are glad that through all this bullshit he actually gets to be happy. Some sort of happiness and that makes you see soo clear why the joker never gets killed in so many battles.

History of joker,"As a person who has watched almost all Hollywood, Bollywood, Japanese and Iranian movies
My opinion on this film is not superficial. So you can read my opinion carefully
I go through all the previous jokes and jokes.
Well, we're with the Joker side
In a very detailed and detailed way, Arthur is trying to cope with the heartless community that thinks everyone is a threat.
A society prone to inappropriate parenting, harsh self-hatred to strangers, and a lack of intimate communication with different strata of government.
In this kind of community that we have already witnessed in different countries
The creation of the joker will be quite natural
In fact, this is what we do:
We force, maltreat, humiliate, and label others
And if they react to jail, or send them to the sanatorium,
let's move on
Arthur in the moments before killing his mother
Feeling a mixture of hatred and complete failure of personality
Here is the joker born, the joker who is all of us, the equation is like this in my view of the joker
Joker = us
Unfortunately, this is happening every moment in the world
Something that will and will be the symbol of that joker
Next thing I would like to discuss is that: 1: Joker killings are not like gang killings or terrorism
2: The joker does not shoot his head in the middle of a victim's pleas
3: The Joker does not work with several hundred people
And most importantly: The Joker has a personal feeling about his victims
Because of money?
For the sake of family?
Is it because of politicians?
He just wants to prove if I did
You deal with Arthur from the poor to the rich, as in the film, the behavior of these two groups is similar to Arthur's.
And now I'll prove
Let me briefly refer to the Batman movie
Joker (Heath Ledger) tries to make people wise
Like Batman wearing pants to prove that everyone can be a joker just a spark.
This!
Let's go back to the modern Joker Arthur!
Well I'd like to suggest you if you've encountered a Joker in your life
The real joker will not steal from you or take away your gold watch
So before you die, where in your life did you unknowingly break the personality of a person who now has a Joker!
Anyway, I'll say one thing about the Joker: I'm sorry, for all the beautiful lies that were designed to keep society standing on the knees of innocent people.
In the end, instead of concluding, I want to convey to you the message of the Joker's personality
Hope it will be useful
Joker message:
You go out of your house in the morning with great clothes and say goodbye to your neighbors.
But you would give a poor person who's going to have your bag dropped off in the subway with a stylish robbery and slander."
Joker,"The Joker. Purchased those tickets expecting the return of Batman's most famous villain? Laughing whilst killing cops? Robbing banks? Burning down hospitals? Well prepare for quite a dissatisfying 120 minutes because this time, Joaquin Phoenix is not playing as the Joker we know, he's playing as someone much more than a maniac and representing something much more than lunacy.Joaquin Phoenix's superb acting and taunting yet victorious music by Hildur Gudnadottir go hand - in - hand and alas produces an almost disturbing and, at the same time, wonderful piece of art. But what enthralled me more is the film's embedded symbolism.Do try to decipher the meanings behind the film and not just merely watching it because by then, what is in our sight takes us away from what is not. How one decipher those meanings may differ, meanings are subjective, but do take notice on the common ground that we can all agree on. For the first time - or for the first time that we realise - the crazy mad clown killer represents the unfortunate, the underrepresented, the disabled, the labelled-as-unhinged...the people. Throughout the first half of the film, Joker is seen as an invalid that no one cares of. Then there is the Wayne who proclaims to be the cure for Gotham, the cure for the madness that people like him (the upper classes) have created, a satire to those who now rule, but never govern. Now watch as the clown that everyone laughs at becomes the person they have always needed, but never knew. In the end, the society's shadow rises as the symbol and the centre of a revolution, an upbringing of the left behind. For once, people realise that maybe they are no different from that clown, the clown that has had enough of the lies, ignorance, and the fake promises of the ruling classes that Wayne represents.One -- I hope -- can realise that this is no ordinary DC film, this is a story of a joke that is our society and a clown who has become weary of laughing."

Exceptional!! I am glad this movie exists..!!,"No CGI, No crappy humor, just raw human emotions portrayed in a manner that you can't look away and you can't stare at him for long, if you do he'll get you..
In a world oversaturated of ""funny"" comic book movies, the only serious one is about a clown
Marvel created an alien warlord villain with super powers by giving him an infinity gauntlet
DC made a human villain by just throwing him into the society taking away everything he had... funny how it works..!!Apparently the best super villain ever in this CGI dominated world is a skinny clown with no powers and being beaten by everyone.. that's dark, that's deep ..DC.. you have my attention!!A masterpiece and Phoenix has owned the movie completely. I have no frikking right to rate one such movie!Do you still wanna know how he got those (O)scars?"
"all I can say is ""wow""","Joaquin Phoenix puts forward one of the best acting performances of our generation. I still watch the Dark Knight to this day for Heath Ledger's incredible performance. While it is certainly unfair to compare one's rendition to the other, I never thought I would see the Joker brought to life in as dynamic of a way as Ledger's Joker, but Phoenix certainly did so.
The movie is deeply disturbing and is an emotional roller-coaster. Without revealing spoilers, the movie is about a severely mentally ill man who is becoming more and more psychotic as society pushes him away and into madness.
The ending. I can't even put it into words. All I will say is this: when Phoenix goes full ""Joker"" at the end, I had goosebumps on my arms for minutes. When you watch the movie, you will know the exact moment I'm talking about.

Amazing and perfect except....,"The plot and the character development is amazing
The psychological part of the movie makes it different it touches depression instead of happiness(comedy), fear(horror/thriller) or adrenaline rush (action)....it touches different kind of emotions however as long as it elicit emotions that enough makes it a great movie, however however i hope that the main character was someone more fit for the role.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Another Legend is Born!!,"Honestly i went to watch this movie for the second time.
I feel the director todd n the actor phoenix have successful to deliver another masterpiece for its viewer.
Besides the violence in the movie, they did make the viewer feel pity about the hard life that joker be in his life and think that what he had done wasn't entirely his fault.
Yet this is the 2019 best movies ever been made.

Joker- The Film of the Decade,"The basic difference in the movie-making styles of Hollywood and Bollywood is that while Bollywood is adept in making an inspiring tale like that of Anand Kumar to a comical, nonsense trash like Super 30, Hollywood makes a once in a generation movie from a DC comic book character and adds a gem like Joker in its treasure trove. The movie right from the word go grips you, gets into you, grows within you, questions your own sanity and does not leave you hours or days after the end credits have rolled. Backed by a tight screenplay, this latest offering from the director Tim Roth of the Hangover fame, this movie has a chilling undertone in each and every frame. Joker follows the basic theorems of movie-making. There are no unnecessary complications or ostensibly layered outlook, which makes this an edge of the seat thriller. The background score, especially in the transformation scenes, is scintillating. Many people have touted it as a tribute to the Scorsese style of film making. But to be true, barring the Departed, Scorsese never played it so simple in any of his movies. Joker in every sense is a path breaker. It won't be an overstatement to say that Roth has actually outshined another maverick filmmaker of this generation, the great Christopher Nolan in portraying the character of Joker, even though his movie on the same character has different premises.A commentary on this great tale will be incomplete without talking about its protagonist Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Legend says that he actually lived in the skin of this character for the last couple of years. His devotion, his sacrifice, his understanding of the character-everything is reflected in every single moment of this movie. This is something you don't believe can exist. He is so normal in portraying an insane, abnormal, complex character like Joker that you start believing as if it's happening for real. The pain the society inflicted on him, the fear of failure, and the depression of being a loser in life and finally liberating the inner pathos through his vendetta and seeking pleasure in bringing anarchy in the society- every emotion has been made visceral by the ace actor. If he does not get the Oscar for this, I think millions of movie lovers like me will lose faith in the credibility of the Academy Awards. Like Vivien Leigh of Gone With the Wind, Humphrey Bogart of Casablanca, Jack Nicholson of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Meryl Streep of Kramer Vs Kramer or Natalie Portman of Black Swan, Joaquin Phoenix will be remembered for the decades to come for his iconic portrayal of this iconoclastic character.
P.S- Phoenix makes Joker so real, you may start loving the negative shades. The real movie starts after this movie ends on the silver screen. Get ready to face the Joker in you."

Joker would be proud,"You should not listen to what anyone says, this movie is a mastepiece. Even now 5 hours after i watched the movie, i still get chills from all the moments in the film. The film does an excellent job at potraying arthurs life and his demise leading him to become the joker. This is not really a comic book movie, it is more a crime movie with certain elements of the batman lore that ties in (good) unexpected ways into the film. Now yes, this does have violence and some disturbing scenes but it is a R-rated film about the joker, if it did not, then the movie would be failure. Everyone reading this should watch the joker and you will even hours after seeing it, feel a shiver down your spine, I guarantee it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

All it takes is one bad day...,"Ever since its debut at the Venice Film Festival, ""Joker"" has been considered a modern masterpiece by many people who watched it. Many were calling it a mixture of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy,"" which are both movies created by filmmaker Martin Scorsese. They were also giving a lot of praise to its lead, Joaquin Phoenix, saying it's possibly one of the most unsettling performances given by an actor in years. With all of these thoughts in mind entering the theater, I had some high hopes. I walked out with my expectations not met but surpassed.This movie is marvelous. When it comes to films and the way they tell stories, this is everything a film lover could hope for. Phoenix is mesmerizing in the role of Arthur Fleck, a very troubled man who is struggling to make sense of his life that eventually leads him to a path of crime. Though his character is awkward in his social interactions and time spent by himself, you can't help but feel sorry for this man who's just being beaten down by society every day. There is an Oscar buzz going around for his performance and it's totally warranted. Phoenix consumes the screen whenever he's on it, which is luckily the entire movieSince this film was based on the legendary comic book villain a lot of people were hoping for the moment Arthur Fleck transforms into the Joker to be a great feeling, but it wasn't a change the audience wants to root for. The filmmakers wisely made the decision to make the character not necessarily likable but understandable. One can understand why the Joker makes the decisions he does but the film doesn't glorify his decisions. When one watches his character arch throughout the movie, there is a sense of dread because you don't really want him to break mentally. This decision, however, makes this an excellent character study and cautionary tale.The other great aspect of the film is its pacing. This is definitely a slow-burning movie but it's never boring. Watching Arthur Fleck from where he was in the beginning to where he ends up is a complete 180 transformation.Throughout the movie, one can tell this man is just like a ticking time bomb, and when the boom explodes, no one will be safe.Todd Phillips, the director, also deserves a lot of praise. This is an amazingly shot and told story. This is by far his best film to date and that was my biggest concern going in. If the Joker was going to get his own feature film, it needed to be a very character-driven movie. The fact that Phillips' most character-driven film prior to this was ""The Hangover"" movies raised huge concerns. Not to disrespect that film, but it's not a high art film. However, Phillips has proven himself to be a director with amazing talent, and I can't wait to see his next project.Another amazing aspect is the cinematography. The color pallets and framing of this film really gets one into the tone of this depiction of Gotham City. Though this film has a dirty and cold exterior, it does have a solid heart at its core.As far as negatives go, I have only minor nitpicks. If anyone has seen the film ""Taxi Driver,"" they will know that a lot of ""Joker"" takes inspiration from that - at times a little too much. Sure, all stories borrow from other stories, and it's not to say that this movie isn't its own thing, but one can easily see that ""Joker"" has a kind of blueprint layout of that movie. There is also a song choice toward the beginning of the third act that I felt was a little cheesy. It was kind of a bigger moment in his transformation and it took me out of the moment a little.Other than that, this is a solid film with a relevant message in today's day and age. It can make one think of the thoughts going on in individuals one sits next to in class, walks past on the street, or sees eating in a restaurant. Who knows, all it takes is one bad day."
"A MASTERPIECE THAT COMES FROM A DARK PLACE, A SAD PLACE, THIS IS HIS OSCAR MOMENT","JOKER !!!! 2019 CINEMATIC RELEASEDC COMICSI BELIEVE THAT JACQUIN PHOENIX IS NOW THE REAL JOKER. HEATH LEDGER WAS AMAZING HOWEVER JACQUIN IS PHENOMENAL AND LEGENDARY.This film activates so much in your mind, about how this world is neglecting mental health and how they expect everyone to behave the same. Sometimes you cannot sitdown and explain things to people because people simply dont understand.
This film potrays that the constent meetings the constent talks that are useless and uncessary. He as an actor and his character makes you realize so much things and so much truth, because it happens in reality. If someone rich dies the world cries but if someone with an illness such as mentality dies in an alley way, the world does not care at all.This film is dark, powerful, and so disturbing. Jacquin Phoenix is going to win the oscar for this and if he does not then he is robbed. You will be transended into a different world in this film.Must see a piece of masterful art of work in film making.

Truly Memorable,"This is my first review on IMDb, and that's because I really wanted my first review to be written about a very special movie. I felt this was the one.This kind of approach to one of the most notorious comics character is so welldone that I question myself why there isn't more of this.Arthur Fleck made me feel a lot of emotions while watching his ordinary life, which is so unfair it hurts, and that has a lot to do with Joaquin Phoenix Oscar-worthy performance.There were a lot of scenes that made me quite disturbed, but for me, the most heartbreaking scene is the one when Arthur is on the bus and is told to stop bothering the kid in front of him. His reaction is so believeble, so perfect that shows how good actor Phoenix really is.This movie deserves, without a doubt, the praise that is receiving.
Whoever you are that is reading this, go see it, please. It's amazing."
Most Intense Movie Of The 2000s,"Joaquin Phoenix's descent into the abyss of being 'The Joker' is the most compelling single achievement of an actor of this young century - and 'Yes', I'm rating it higher than Heath Ledgers 'thought-to-be' immortal performance.You ask 'Why?'Because I'm certain that this movie will change this society's perspective on mental illness (it kinda already has), disorders and the state of this f'd up society in general. For too long the bottom half was forcefed with plastic TV, irrevelant news to keep them tranquilized and under the lid of our 'so-shiny-perfect-life' where the amount of IG-followers decides over your importance to society.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is a MILESTONE of method acting, a bloodchilling hard-to-watch experience of pain and suffering, an indefinite ride through the pain of a single human being looking for the most human thing there is - love.'Joker' is a sure award-lock in every meaningful competition this year (Actor, Film, Director, Score, Camera, Screenplay, Script) and Phillips propelled himself into 'take-all-our-money-and-do-what-you-want'-territory from now on.See it before it catches you, I'll definitely see it at least once more because 'All I Have Are Negative Thoughts'.MASTERPIECE!"

"It's brilliance, swop critic's head - It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be","I usually write reviews on amazing movie experiences or if my perception of the movie is the opposite of the so called critics.This time is both!I don't think I need to point out anything for Joaquin's performance, Oscar worthy, brilliant, at the same level as Heath, even though the comparison is really inglorious, since this is a standalone movieNow for the movie itself, above all, I believe it conveys a really strong message which most of us would like to ignore, which is the suffering and complications with intense mental disorders.
I am not an American national, but I've been there several times, and I strongly believe that not only, there is still a heavy stereotype for this individuals, but also, given the current social/economic reality, not enough has been done for those who carry this traumas.And while the movie explores this, it doesn't compromise the infamous villain story, it actually brings a wider perspective on his motives and behavior, and how he reached the downward spiral we all witnessed in the Dark KnightI am also not a fan of a specific component of the story line, which they used to cause more impact, I won't spoil it, let's just say they could have used any other character to convey the exact same message.Aside from that, overall it's an intense, dark, bold movie, which contrary to critics mention of bringing nothing new, it actually does.
No it's not a ripoff of Taxi Driver, inspired? Maybe, but if you indeed compare it, I actually believe Joker provides even more in depth to the psychology of the character as well as way more context.It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be"
Breathtaking,"Flawless performances, music, camerawork and script. Just full ten from me. Plot was simple, it focuses on the Arthur. Hes life and mental state. Everything else is just static around him, meaningless. If you pay close attention, you can see how surrounding world changes with Arthur's own life.

One of the greatest films,"'We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off'This dialogue from the movie FIGHT CLUB justifies JOKER movie and what i realized is a good childhood is so important for a person to cheer n be happy when he is in his/her 20s and 30s that's the age where we have to do a lot of hard work in our lives and become successful, but sometimes somethings go wrong and it makes you unhappy and depressed so at that moment you think of your childhood memories and if they make you happy then it will definitely give you the hope and you get up again n again but if it haunts you it's the real disaster and then you start doubting yourself which leads to depression and then everything seems so awful that you turn into a person who doesn't care about the society and start doing things without restricting yourself from the small line of right and wrong, you don't care about the consequences, now whether it is right or wrong that's debatable, but JOKER movie tells each n every person that 'see you always wanted to react in this way when someone was cruel with you but you never did' so that's so relatable about this film to each n every person in this world... Joker is everywhere ❤ because everyone is pissed off...#toddphillips1 - great director 👏🏻❤ #bigfan

This is because Phoenix takes you with him, deep in his conscience, you want to feel empathy, you cheer him.This is not a normal DC superhero film. It's more anti-hero.

"I watched this masterful thriller last weekend, and I've decided to make an IMDb account to show my appreciation for it as much as I can (also this review is spoiler free).","Gotham is a decaying and depressing city with Arthur trying to be a ray of sunshine in the darkness (he works as a clown for an entertainment company), but he is repeatedly mistreated and largely ignored by society, making him become increasingly aggressive even towards those he loves. He eventually becomes an icon of rebellion as he starts to become more and more relentless, eventually craving his newfound attention and fully embracing it. Many thought the character of this iconic villain was tainted by Jared Leto's performance in Suicide Squad, but this fully compensated it, Heath Ledger sure as hell would be glad about this. This film proves that sometimes it's lengthy character development that makes a better film than frequent action sequences and CGI. So by all means, believe me when I say that the hype is deserved, it's well worth your time ;).1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A great and unnerving story powered by Joaquin Phoenix's flawless performance.,"6 out of 5.What are you expecting? Mark Hamill's Joker? Heath Ledger maybe? Jared Leto before he went to a punk rock bar or maybe Jack Nicholson and Tim Burton? Let me offer you one word advice. Go in without expectations. The movie is far more darker than Tim Burton can imagine and more mentally disturbed than Ledger's protrayal.In this movie there is no dramatic music pounding in the background. There is no superhero. Honestly, you can drop the entire Joker/Batman thing and still have a movie that is truly a masterpiece. What there is, is a great and unnerving story powered by Joaquin Phoenix's flawless performance. He commanded every scene with the skill unmatched by anyone I have seen in a long time.Do yourself a favor. Drop your expectations. Forget about Batman. Go to the movies and watch this in the dark. Oh yeah, hit the bathroom before you go in. You won't want to get up for any reason."
Don't listen to the Fake media or the critics.,"Truly captivating, however the Critics and Media still want to make this movie/character look terrible to push their own agendas.

"A brilliant masterpiece, but I understand why it's difficult to watch.","My second review in IMDB. I went to watch this film for a second time and I'm considering a third. I have never, and I mean, NEVER, wanted to go back and watch a movie again and again. As other commenters - I admit that I also understand why the movie causes division. I understand the political views, I understand that many shooting victim relatives are worried this could somehow spark an individual with the desire to shoot, to really do it, I understand the movie TALKS openly about mental illness. I am so sorry to all victims. But you should understand that this movie is not MEANT to empathize Arthur through allowing yourself to justify his actions. He is a broken man, he was abused to the point he lost his way. People get all kinds of bullying and a lot of people survive though it, yet a lot of them don't. They either end it or they turn into the darker side - a coping mechanisms, sick mechanism. But this IS the human. It is complex, it is an endless encyclopedia and I think it is of a great importance to show this. Maybe the word you're searching for is heartbreaking. We see a man who could have survived through the bullying, but instead he gave himself to the demons, because of constant social suppression merged with the mental illness he already had. It is how it is. Should we ignore it? Should we slam it just because it's political, or because it's showing guns, or because it touches the topic of mental illness, or anything else that sparks controversy? No... Yes, these topics are complex, it's not news, it is the hardest things to talk about, but I think it's bold and brave to make this film and I appreciate the whole cast and crew for making it. This film shows all of it, all raw from the human soul. And what makes it good is, as our screenwriting lecturer in our film course explains, we show a complex character, which does bad things, but we understand why he/she does them. We are not MEANT to sympathise, empathize, but UNDERSTAND why they did what they did.I am sorry for those who find it dark or too involved in these topics. But I think it's extremely important for this movie to be here, to teach about things they don't tell us in school, but also to provoke yourself, to see what you should never turn into. This movie is NOT urging people to become criminals. No, no, no, no, no. It's supposed to make you sick, it's supposed to make you want to leave the room, because you don't want to ever end up in this situation. Because we understand how horrible all of this is. Unfortunately, not all people will understand this movie. And this is where all the negativity comes from. As I said, I understand the so many relatives, friends, acquaintances of people who have died in similar scenarios, I understand why they are worried. We don't know who is watching this movie, we don't know what is going through their head. And unfortunately, it may cause a spark in them. But if this movie is not out, we never see it. We never understand. We never are aware, we don't have the proper knowledge of it. Because me knowing more about mental illness teaches me how to protect, how to react, how to preserve. It teaches me to treat people right, to be there for them, to NEVER do them wrong. And trust me, one person is not a lot, but it is something and it could save a soul.It is a difficult film, but it was shown flawlessly."
Had to see it twice due to the brilliance of the entire thing.,"Wow. Believe it or not, it was even better the second time i saw it, because i knew the story and could look for things. I thought I would be able to better understand what is 'real', and what is not the second time, however the writing is so brilliant that you just do not know. We have not seen many movies like this over the past 20 years, and this will be iconic for a long time. Possibly the movie of the generation. I cannot support this film enough. It should win pretty much every major oscar award, including score of all things. Simply wow.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The True Meaning of A Masterpiece,"Been hyping Joker for the past 5 months (since the teaser trailer dropped) and it really lived up the expectation. If not, it felt better than any expectations out there.When I watched the teaser, I know this movie will be that kind of movie that gets stuck in your head until you're no longer breathing air. It's solid, beautiful, disturbing, funny, and extremely memorable.I love every second of it.It's a no surprise that Joaquin Phoenix outdo himself (again) in this role. He has caught every essence of Arthur Fleck and executed it as uniquely possible.Todd Phillips's direction was light but beyond meaningful. He helped Phoenix perfected his storytelling and it matched every main aspects of filmography; music, cinematography, editing, script, and of course acting.The score from Hildur Gudnadottir was also an excellent match for the whole film. It's haunting, intimate, personal, daring, and unsettling. Her music really molded the film's soul from the very first scene. Just beautiful.Watched it (so far) for three times. And I was in heavenly experience for three times. Go. Watch. It.Wrote my first watch review on my blog fadhilasupriana.blogspot.com go check it out!"
The best performance I have ever witnessed on screen,"Like all great movies, I need a few hours after the first viewing to absorb, and reflect. I'm talking about Joker. This is spoiler free, don't worry.It's a rare thing to go into a film that lives up the the hype. Well, this one surpasses it. The story itself, we've seen kind of before, a person who's just been pushed too far, but here it's different, it's not a guy breaking bad, it's the story of a man who from the outset is disturbed to his very core, a man already gone over the edge, he's literally fallen so far, he's landed where he fell off.His descent into further madness is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is not borderline genius, it's more than genius, every minute he's on screen, there is minor changes in his character that has to be surpassed from the previous minute. I have to wonder what his sanity is like after wrapping up. From the contortions of his emaciated body, to the expressions of absolute mental torture during his maniacal laughter. He is glorious, and I have never seen any actor give a performance like this. You know you should be appalled by his actions, but you cannot help but feel sorry for such a tortured character. Forget about the Oscar, he should get every conceivable award this year for this performance.This leads me to Director Todd Phillips, he does a masterful job in tying everything together, but I can't go into that too much as it will lead to spoilers. The mood of a frustrated and explosive Gotham City is depressing as the mood of the world we live in now.The soundtrack is great, some fantastic tracks from the time period as well as some really very haunting tunes from the same artist who worked on Chernobyl, The Handmaids Tale and The Reverend, ok I had to check IMDB but if your a fan of those shows and movie, you'll know what I mean, Hildur Guðnadóttir is her name and it's now on my phone, and I'm listening as I type.Everything about this movie is perfect and a real joy for a fan of the Bat, and yes there is tons of connections. Check out Bruce's treehouse, a wonderful blink and you'll miss homage to the 60's Batman tv show.a rare hyped movie that will have a cult following forever. 
11/10"
Great and deep!,"It's amazing how the film sequence goes so well, the great director's work makes you put into joker's life and how he sees the society and the world. This couldn't be possible without Phoenix's performance, its an amazing job than I haven't seen in a while. This movie can makes you feel sad at the end because you can understand a little part of how this kind of psychiatric persons may feel, and how the society ignore them. I've never had that feeling like that.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Deserves all the Oscars.,"Now, I must say even hearing about the film and seeing the trailer, I actually wasn't looking forward to this film .. it was only till my friends had seen it and came back raving with so much hype I had to go see what all the fuss was about.And let me tell you it was worth ALL THE HYPE! Truly one of the best films of the year if not THE best, I was gripped throughout, literally the movie has every element of your emotions, it's a crazy whirlwind and thanks to the acting it really makes some parts feel real. You will leave that cinema dissecting every part of the film, your brain won't stop thinking about it for days.Joaquin was truly magnificent and cannot be faulted, the best acting I've seen in a while. This movie is definitely worth a watch even if you don't fancy it from the trailer. See it for yourself. Be focused and enjoy this crazy wonderful film.The best Joker yet. Give it all the Oscars!"

Delightfully disturbed,"As a frequent movie goer and fellow performer I would just like to say first off I am thoroughly impressed. The entirety of this film was extremely depressing. Any sliver of happiness that Arthur gets, seems to just get extracted viciously out of his life. You watch his slow decent into madness and you're clenching onto your seat to see what he might do next; whether that is killing ruthlessly, or creating fake relationships in his twisted mind. Joaquin Phoenix depicts the perfect battle between good and evil with his constant struggle between happiness and sadness. In the end I was honestly routing for the joker because of the pain manifested through his whole life. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me see things differently about society. Everyone is a little mad. 10/101 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A Masterpiece,"There are parts of this movie that are actually uncomfortable to watch and it's unflinching reality is what makes it so special.

Todd Phillips' Joker might be bringing cinema to a new era.,"Far from a superhero flick,the name of the Joker managed to bring again to the cinema theaters all kinds of people,showing the effect good cinema can have as a collective experience.Good cinema appeals to everyone,not only cinephiles and Phillip's Joker is the proof.A film with no effects,no thriller elements,of not more than one character,with no car chases,no superhero costumes manages to be just mesmerising for a mere 2 hours.That is mainly due to Joaquin Phoenix.Cinematography is beautiful just as the direction,but the film lives through Phoenix who is haunting.A film that maybe shows that we as an audience might had been getting it wrong all along just as the studios might had miscalculated what we really like in the first place.Just like references as Taxi Driver were creating havoc upon their release,maybe the Joker will bring again the cinema to a new golden era,giving blockbusters a new different meaning.As for the social commentary,I will not comment on the nonsense.I will just say that what the film is accused for couldn't be further from the truth.There is a message.That's that we should think again of all the times we turned our back to people in need,all the times we laughed at them and all the times we didnt give a helping hand when they were so desperately trying to reach out.Maybe Joker can make us better,only for a while.I'm just stunned."

It's not a comic book movie,"This is more of a psychological movie than a comic book movie, it's so deep it may bore you.

Why we should never be the reason a good person would resort to violence and madness.Rating: 10/10 ✨You should see how Joaquin Phoenix transform from Arthur to being the Joker to becoming a symbol.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

It's about changing the idea of latest ""blockbuster"" movies. In every part and every frame of this movie, you can see a reform movement. Within Joker's rivalry against society and it's standarts, you can see people's hatred upon hollywood.As i saw in the last six days, there is now a hope because of this movie. Because it has exceeded our expectations. It has broke the law of being boring, and amused us. Even this makes this movie a miracle, a masterpiece, and it deserves to be watched."

A dazzling demonstration of what both Phillips and Phoenix are capable of,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers a perfect representation of the clown prince of crime in this absolutely phenomenal film. Todd Phillips did an excellent job in the writing and direction of the film and the sound track is also one of the best I've seen for a long time. This is by far my favourite movie of all time and I do think it will age well despite the controversy over its depictions of violence which help demonstrate the capabilities of such a twisted character. I would certainly suggest this film even if you are not a comic movie fan since this really departs from the flashy antics we are used to and narrows in on the nitty, gritty details of such an infamous character, giving us a realistic, in depth study on a mentally ill person.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

What's the joke? You won't get it.,"These last dialogues from the film predicted what many critics and viewers will be faced with. Upon reading several reviews and listening to the constroversy surrounding this movie, I was somewhat skeptical that may be this movie just pushed the right hot buttons ideologically/politically, and that would be it, nothing more. But not only Joker mirrored the real life themes of mental health, poverty and elitism, but also managed to be a solid origin movie of a comic book villain. This movie neither inspires violence or glorifies incel like behavior as media is falsely suggesting, it puts the main character in the spot light from the beginning on how mentally unstable and unsettling his behavior is. I don't think this movie even sympathize with the joker to even make his rationals (if there are any) or actions justifiable, but instead it only presents a bleak picture of society where such people are ticking timebomb, and without the help they need, they are destined to have a similar (but not as theatrical as Joker's) fate. This movie is sometimes disturbing in it's plot points, and Jeaquin Phoenix's performance is crazy good and very unsettling, even in the society that is represented, but to say either this is a movie about a sane actor in an insane world or a sane character in an insane world would be injustice. This movie is about the insanity coming it terms with it, and realizing the world is just as insane. The Joke is truly on us, and only reason we are laughing because we are in constant pain just like the Joker."

Best comic book film ever!,Oscar worthy in all categories. Better than dark knight.
Finally a movie we deserve!,"Joker will draw you into his madness and sociopathy that will make you question everything. Todd and Joaquin bring us a masterpiece of human nature and how person is shaped by events that are happening to them.Joker is a dramatic piece that will be understood by regular people and seen in grey areas and not only black and white. It's about human tortures and dramatic events that happen all around us but we pretend like everything is fine. Joker dives deep into dark teritories and pushes boundaries with extreme violence but shows us why is everything happening and how our protagonist is dealing with information given to him. Arthur Fleck is a disturbed man which is evident from beginning but as story goes you find to learn more about him and how he is only trying to find its way in the crazy world.There are multiple possibilites for someone if they pursue them, they might not be the best but Arthur chooses one that he feels most comfortable with and his sense of comedy and darkness is unique but who are we to put his hopes and dreams down. Joaquin's commitmend to role is extraordinary, he pushes boundaries with his dedication for characters place and feelings. It is absolutely magnificent to watch him present us Arthur in all his colors and shades as he is mesmerasing, deceving and twisted.Todd moving from his regular comedy type movies and going full drama, choosing Joker (DC comics based character) and putting him in real world with real people insted of fictional universe is praise worth and him developing such a intriguing story that will feel like you are watching some regular drama inspired by time and day we live in. We live in sick and hard times but we choose to fight and overcome everything but there will always be other ones that are not capable of doing it and it will make them mad. Insted seeing this movie as movie that can make people do bad things it should make them see that bad things are not acceptable and how they make things dark and chaotic. and will always end in personal destruction.Directing and writing of Joker is marvellous from every point, it may not be the smart as some movies but it is captivating and makes you wonder all the time how things are going to happen and how they might have happened. Todd may have started his new path into greater film making and it will be interesting to see what he has to offer in the upcoming years.Dark, twisted and magnificent are the best words to describe the movie. 10/10"
A masterpiece,"It's a prominent movie that describe simply how Arthre Flick turned to The Joker but in a destinctive way

Breathtaking performance,"If you want an origin story from the DC world, then you have to see this film. It is not an action packed adventure like batman, but a story of a man who lives in a world that is unjust, unforgiving and toxic.
The music score throughout helps the intensity of the story and Mr Phoenix's portrayal and character development really is astounding.
Will have to watch it again to get my head around the storyline some more.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Cinematic Classic! Heath Ledger would be Proud of This.,"This is an incredible achievement. It has the much needed depth for modern day movies and is equally gripping. The origin of Joker is as poignant as the origin of Batman himself. The seemingly unsmiling Batman who wants order does need, and indeed does depend on the equally mighty force of laughter and chaos that comes to be the Joker. The descent into disorder, the hatred of the successful, etc. is all seamless. I am truly glad that this movie held on to its darker tones as it is, after all, a dark Batman and Joker story. Order and Chaos. Bring it on. I do sincerely hope that they continue with this storyline and we see more of this intense stuff. 10/10 from me. Not 9.

A Movie You'll Feel Honoured to Watch,"""Phenomenal"" is the first word that comes to mind.It's rare to see so much talent in one movie. The style of direction pulls you right in to the dark world of Gotham city. It's psychological, it's gloomy and it's crazy, oh yeah. Without spoiling anything, some events in the movie are sure to hit you hard.The music is just perfect and makes the whole film smooth and much more effective. However, the best part of the movie is the actors. Every single character in the movie is portrayed so well, you'll need to remind yourself several times that you're watching a film. You'll find yourself doing a self sanity-check after watching the movie!Ultimately, there's Joaquin Phoenix. One thing I can tell you is that he deserves all the hype and more. The acting is at the next level. In my entire life, I've never felt so painful hearing someone laugh. The laughter, the dance, makeup, behavior and the personality, you will know no better ""Joker"". Joaquin DEFINES what this film meant to be.Anything less than 10/10 will be an insult to this masterpiece. If you don't carry a hatred towards psychological movies, definitely go check it out :)"
Absolutely Marvellous Acting By JP!!,"This movie is nothing about hero..
Its about an innocent man becoming a psychopath!
And they delivered it most convincing way!
From start to finish.. You will feel what's really going on!
Kudos to the Director,cinematographer, music composer, script writer and the one who pulled of the Marvellous Acting........JOAQUIN PHOENIX!!

People from the shadow got their 5 minutes in this movie for all of us to see how World can be dark and miserable place. That happen when people forget to be humans and to care for each other in the first place.

A truly sensational depiction.,"Joker is a truly sensational dive into the back story of the Joker. A twisted look into his dark descent on the road to becoming the Joker. The character development is sublime with Pheonix playing an absolutely incredible version of the joker, matching his twisted insanity with scarily accurate acting. This is the back story the Joker really needed, away from all the CGI rubbish, and in with deep and dark story telling that keeps you on the edge of your seat! I also love the way a young Bruce Wayne was introduced, leading to the excitement of a potential sequel or appearance in the next Batman movie. The ending was also very very good and depicts how he became a legend amongst Gothams darkest.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A Gritty.realistic and amazing movie,"Best movie released this year and one of the best comic book movie ever made challenged only by The Dark Knight. Absolutely amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.He has portrayed the character so brilliantly,somehow evoking our sympathy for a psychotic homicidal clown. Todd Philips and Phoenix somehow makes us feel sad of the Joker but also makes us scared of him. The movie has an uncomfortable feel to it with amazing cinematography and a beautiful score. Every time the score starts to play you know somethings about to happen but you don't know what. The ending is amazing and somehow makes you feel satisfied but also uncomfortable that you feel that way. The movie portrays a grim but realistic world and how far a person like Arthur Fleck can be hurt before he starts to fight back.Amazing plot, amazing acting,amazing directing job and overall an amazing movie.10/10 with a cherry on top1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

"The Joker Has Arrived, And Its Brilliant!","It has took a 100 years for cinema to be where it is now and if Joker is any insight into this era of film, it's looking good. Firstly, Joaquin's chilling and haunting portrayal of a man trying to live his life while being broken at every chance in his life and every person possible is brilliant. The exploration of mental health not only by the writer but by the leads superb slowly dying eyes, his shallow and piercing laugh and his physicality being broken down into a skeletal structure laced with skin. This performance is amazing and as you walk out of that cinema room you will sit down and think ""That is what the movies are made for."" Although seen from teared filled eyes, the performance by all the cast and especially Phoenix and De Niro's performance as Arthur and Murray are some of the best in history with haunting and chilling moments that make you question who the good guy here is.
I love superhero films and i have very high standards when film making is experimenting with these established characters but my words are lost to the element of fulfilment i am at. The FLAWLESS script packs a punch with turns of emotion and surprise every second and it is a great way to use your time on this Earth and sit back and SMILE!. I wrote this 30 minuets after seeing this film and i am still overwhelmed but i can only leave you on 3 points:Leave this film as a solo outing and we can all be happy...You will never get another chance to see this in cinema so GO NOW!!Bring On The Clowns!DC have had a rough outing lately but this film has improved and adjusted what i fought was good cinema and i feel if you enjoy the art of film making, this film is a must see. 10/10."

One of the best movies I've seen this year,"Joaquin Phoenix once again proved to be one of the most versatile actors of our age. He for sure will carry home many awards this year and rightfully so, because it would be a crime not to recognize his astonishing performance portraying such complex characters.
The movie is intense and touches a lot of important topics: battle with mental illnesses, the war between the rich and the poor, injustice, lack of empathy, etc. When life is so bad that the villain becomes the hero and a leader of a movement. A very tragic, thought provoking story that leaves you with many questions about the world we live in.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Don't listen to the media, this movie is wonderful","Although Arthur Fleck had a sick sense of humor that was often times off putting, yet the biggest joke of all related to the film is the media and metacritic coverage. Shock journalism has done a massive disservice to Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips and the rest of the crew that created this wonderful film about a man that just could not get a break, and eventually broke himself.
Very reminiscent of the Taxi Driver, but much more a product of current times, Joker has a dark message to share about the instability and cruelty of our modern society while at the same time serving as a great character study and origin story for this infamous villain.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A terrifying masterpiece,"Probably the best acting performance ever. And I don't say that lightly.
I don't remember the last time I watched a film and delved so deeply into the mind of the main character. It's scary, depressing at times.. but a shockingly real mirror on western society. From the smallest details in scenes, the viewer can abstract and pull real life experiences.
It takes the viewer so deep inside the mind of an indivudual who is confused on his reality vs consensus reality. We are taken on a journey of realisations, discovery of past trauma and floor shattering, life changing discoveries that even makes the viewer question their reality, their past and their capacity to fall into a confused state of mind. Once Patrick's floor of reality is taken from below him, he doesn't know how to react, his worldview is flipped and he is thrown into a freefall of madness. You as the viewer go there with him and the acting performance is so brilliant, you really feel all his anxieties and confusion of reality transferred onto you.A depressing film, I left the cinema is desperate need of positive thoughts.
However.. as one of the most important films of the decade I believe this film should be inspected and thought deeply about the problems in our society."

On par with Heath Ledger's iconic role in Dark Knight.,"I was blown away by the acting skills of Joaquin Phoenix. As the movie moves forward you start to emerge in the movie, more and more every second. The movie tries to get you really interested in the tragedy of Arthur Fleck likes it's smoothly going up like a roller coaster but when it hits, it hits like a car crash you are completely devastated by shocks and thrills that are delivered by the movie. I never thought that anyone would be able to portray the character of Joker as finely did by Heath Ledger but Man o Man this is just a complete another level. The movie has dark humor, it is tragic but it makes your ideology struggle for if what Arthur did was right or wrong. If you haven't watched this movie you are missing a milestone of acting set by Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is another level of awesome at another level of darkness. If you thought Joker was twisted you will come to know in this movie that people are more twisted. Truly a masterpiece.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
2019's Masterpiece,"Simple as that. Joker is a masterpiece. As a character driven origin film, this is the quintessential DC movie.As a film, Joker is incredible to behold. It almost feels like an honour watching some of the best cinematography and directing of this year come alive right before your eyes. Each shot is like a painting perfectly making use of the 80's athsetic.Joaquin Phoenix puts in a career best performance, equalling and some times surpassing Ledgers take in 'The Dark Knight'. The supporting cast around him is fantastic too from De Niro as the Gotham talk show host to Zeze Beetz as Arthurs Flecks love interest and neighbor.Joker is one of the best films of 2019 and extremely important now more than ever with its realistic take on how mental illness affects us and the people around us. I cant say enough how this film is A MASTERPIECE!"
It was a journey!,"I'm literally home lying down trying to digest what I just saw. This movie was a masterpiece. It definitely requires more than one viewing to truly appreciate and understand the masterful work. This was my first viewing so I'll hold off on throwing out any ratings etc, but let me tell you this: it was a journey! It was honestly the little things that I was able to notice that really convinced me of Joaquin's performance. And his ability to just throw that laugh out there off and on cue was insane. This movie is truly something special!
Phoenix did an excellent job capturing the essence of the character in his performance.
I actually understood the protagonist, his inner battles, his journey. It was Genius, pure genius. It was in my opinion hauntingly excellent, and executed with great precision.
They basically just made this portrayal more realistic. Although it wasn't comic accurate (which it wasn't meant to be), I was happy to see Joker go off and be his true maniacal self. In other words, that R rating did wonders for his character. Much like Logan!
My only issue with it is the fact that they made this masterful piece to just be a one off. Why can't they make a cinematic universe built like this? Just like the MCU."
An afterthought from the time Hollywood still made truly great films,"I normally would cringe at the thought of giving any film a 10 rating, no movie is perfect and I guess this isn't either, but for me I suppose this gets pushed from a 9 to a 10 just for being the type of film that Hollywood just doesn't make anymore.This movie takes one of comic's most famous mad clowns and takes you with him on the soul destroying journey of how he became Joker. Don't listen to the online loonies, this movie won't make you attack anyone, it will however make you think about mental illness and the people who suffer in silence. As well as the general, but basic, concept of kindness to others.On this journey, though you often vehemently disagree with joker's actions, you're nonetheless compelled to understand those choices. Phoenix and Phillips don't just deserve Oscars for this, what they've created essentially amounts to a treatise on the more tragic side of the human condition"
Masterpiece of 2019,"Sat in the theater without any context , story started building with the perfect background score , you don't even wanna relate the acting of previous joker to this one , they were defined as sociopaths, but this one , you watch him see become one , and no Not a sociopath but a pyscopath.

I loathe superhero films but........,"This was absolutely jaw dropping. If JP doesn't get best actor for this then the Oscars should be permanently disregarded as an absolute farce.

If anyone likes this, check out a documentary called Hail Satan? , which has a similar theme of examining 'otherness'.

What a performance! 5 days later and I'm still thinking about it.,"First and foremost i loath todays marvel and DC movies for being so over the top and for being cheesier that an Olympic size swimming pool filled with Cèso. Okay i will admit i liked guardians of the galaxy and avengers end game but that is it. But i can go see a million movies like this one if they had the same feel and performance as Joker did. It was so gritty and realistic i felt apart of that world, the cinematography was so good it was like fine art. And speaking of fine art Joaquin Phoenix needs to win an Oscar for his magnificent and believable performance i was awestruck threw out the entirety of the film at this man commitment to his his art. He has risen out of the fire and has become the joker. I have no other joker now he is the joker. Yes heath and jack are still great jokers but neither of them to it to level of Phoenix diving deep into the man himself. The director is also a genius the plot was relevant and impactful, the twist and turns were cleverly hidden, he was true yet unique the the joker universe. I have heard some critics say it had no message or meaning if this is true then why are we still taking about this movie days later and not just asking if you have seen it but really having deep conversations about it? I find myself still contemplating the film and will go watch it a 4th time this week cause I am not yet satisfied my quench has not yet been satisfied i need more. Go watch this film and forget about the sjw critics and media the are destroying their own art"

A perfect origin to a perfect villain,"I dont understand the hate. I was very excited for this movie, then I read some reviews saying that it isnt actually good. But why? I saw one review where s/he literally wrote that s/he wanted to see a villain killing for no reason. Is that how a story works? If someone is a psycho. There has to be some reason and proper explanation about what he is doing or why he is doing. Killing people without any reason doesnt bring any character arc to the character. I think Phoenix nailed it as the Joker. His acting was perfect. If we talk about Cinematography, then its pretty notched up. The violence and action in this movie isnt high like any other superhero movie. But I think thats what make this movie more realistic and relatable to the real world. I am a die hard marvel fan, and I loved this movie. Music score is top notched, you would have heard it in the teaser trailer. His laughs really shows someone with suffering nd pain. The best thing I observe about this movie is that its well placed. The scenes have been deleted and cut in a proper manner, to give the exact runtime that a plot like this should have. It just didnt feel stretched. I lob"
"If ever Heath Ledger is reborn as Joker, it would be like Joaquin Phoenix","A ride that makes us feel connected. A journey that leaves a beautiful flavor of acting for long time. I should Thank Todd Phillips for imagining in a sensible way for portraying a perfect character. There are several edge of the seat moments and several jump out of shock moments. On the whole movie makes us to a roller coster of emotions played by just one MAN. I went with an open mind and came back with a heavy heart. I didnt see what's coming. Yes, Joaquin deserves an Oscar and it's a gunshot decision. Really tough to make an expression in a convincing manner that is either a laugh or condition or just sad or cry.

A realistic view into a villains uprising - finally !,"Before I touch upon the content of the movie , I have to say the vibe it creates is like a Taxi Driver of the modern age with super villain in the making overtones ; which is funny because Deniro is in the joker , I wonder if the director did this purposefully ?Anyways , this movie was an amalgamation of emotions stirred up for a person I didn't think I ever cared for , aside from being a badass in a previous portrayal by Heath. Let's put this to rest right now ; Joaquin's Joker was so real to the point that I connected on a more personal level (than previous jokers including heaths) and I can see authenticity in this joker being THE joker that eventually faces off with Bats - even in this ""depressing"" formative period of his .... despite being exposed to an action packed super intelligent Heath Joker years before this .The feeling of powerlessness and a world against you is really what gets you down through your first 40 minutes or so in the movie but it's not a depressingly down feeling it's more of a contemplatively-down feeling for Arthur's condition and his situation in life . Essentially , it's hard to NOT feel for Arthur as opposed to what previous movies would conjure up in us for the joker - which always painted him as a one sided villain as opposed to the complex more than human Joker we see in this film.Overall the scenes were shot so well I felt like I was watching an old movie, which also helped complete the feeling of taxi driver (also that revolver Joker gets seems like a snubbed version of it), but also gave the setting of the film a perfect alibi - this WAS INDEED the time before Batman ; and we can tell from the scenery , the outfits and the props ... very well done. I feel although there's no promise of a sequel , the director and cast HAS to deliver a sequel - as the roller coaster ride of this journey has just begun and they really pulled the tempo of the film off correctly as to really entice us to be hungry for more screen time of Arthur In his very earliest joker years .If I could , I would see this made into a tv series as it seems so realistic with the way it displayed this joker , and the action was spread out enough to create suspense and many other emotions . If this was done I would expect them to cast Joaquin , due to his great performance , or at least someone that can emulate his exact performance and demeanor - as this was a performance I didn't expect to ""attract"" me so much as it did .Great film , 10/10 for me - if it weren't for the critics mindlessly bashing this title I wouldn't have written this review , but I feel like this is something we need to speak up about because everyone seeing this film either really likes it or LOVES it - BESIDES the critics ... hmmm I wonder why ? Maybe it has something to do with the AGENDA of those that wish to push a specific NARRATIVE for their platform? Look that's fine and all but please be a bit more transparent with your bias if you choose to run a review website .Compare the critics to the user reviews , how many of each one and you will see who the liars are and who is telling the truth about the movie . Everythings an ""opinion"" they will say after slanging dirt in an untruthful review ... ok that's fine but don't go bashing something that was shot , edited , directed , and written WELL and try to pretend like it's just some unbiased opinion, we can see through that !I, like thousands of others , went into the film UNBIASED and loved it , do the same and you will too ; go in there thinking the movie will have your incel neighbor boy kill you , you will leave there confused just to go on your critic profile on meta critic and bash for no reason and that will guarantee you have a bad time under the guise of social semantics ."

Amazing,Definitely going back to watch again! the best movie i have seen so far this year and Joaquin Phoenix´s performance would make Heath Ledger proud.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
Instant Timeless Classic Masterpiece. Unbelievable!,"First review I've ever felt compelled to write for a film...This film definitely lived up to the hype surrounding it and more!
After seeing Phoenix had been cast for the role, I was extremely excited as I've been a huge fan of his acting since his portrayal of Johnny Cash in Walk The Line. Never the less, I, like so many others was slightly sceptical that he may not live up to Heath Ledger's Joker but wanted to reserve judgement until seeing the film.
How wrong I was to have any scepticism. Phoenix's performance is for me the best acting I have ever seen in any film. Ever! I could not take my eyes off him on the screen in the cinema.
The film itself was much darker than I was expecting which I found really refreshing - tacking the issues surrounding personality disorders and mental health and how society can drive an individual to madness. Such a fantastic origin story that could simply be a stand alone film and still work without any links to the comic books.
I saw the film 4 days ago and don't think I've ever left a cinema feeling so utterly blown away by a film in my life. I have not stopped thinking about the film since and cannot wait to watch this masterpiece of film making and acting masterclass again.
Jaoquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips should win every award going when awards season arrive.
And I agree with other comments about Ledgers and Phoenix's portrayals not being comparable. But for me Phoenix's has just slightly edged it 🤡"

Joker the existentialist superhero,"The movie is amazing, acting is superb, no childish action or CGI superhero nonsense. It's pure acting and pure cinema. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for this.Everyone is comparing it to Heath Ledger's Joker, I don't think it's comparable. I mean it's the same character but that is all, it ends there, this is much deeper and much more serious, we should compare it to Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro who also plays here (was that intentional?). Joker is a 150 years old character, he's the Underground Man and the he was created by Dostoevsky. Watch it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Thx Mr. J:The Shot in the Arm that DC Needed,"I wanna start by saying that I was a skeptic of this movie but it delivered 10fold and then some. I swore not to get caught up in the hysteria that is Batman's greatest foe but it's well earned and only furthers the mystique that is the Clowned Prince.Addressing the fake news originally reported by Vicki Vale about people walking out of the movie. If you happened to be amongst those weak souls; you deserve every bit of Batman vs Superman and probably list Val Kilmer as your fav Batman😒If you complained at the political undertones I can only conclude you've never seen a DC show. There were some but I saw it more as: art imitating life. Say all this to say: Joker was the blockbuster that DC so desperately needed; Joaquin deserves a standing ovation. It may be an origin story for the Joker but it ultimately serves as a origin story for Batman! Not all too sure where they from here but I'm along for the ride.Lastly be kind to the local weirdo, we all have internal struggles that the world will forever be oblivious of, instead lend a helping hand. Who knows that weirdo may just kill you last?!"

Joker from the first clip to last will draw you in and make you believe you are there.The fitting lunch line 'You get what you deserve' sums up Arthur's descent into the violent persona of The Joker concluding with murder, mayhem and madness.Joaquin Phoenix should be a slam dunk to win the Oscar and Robert DeNiro is superb as the Johnny Carson of Gotham.

Joker rises like a Phoenix!,"Below is the transcript from my video review on my YouTube channel, Slice of Pai. Please subscribe, would mean the world to me and I'm trying to change it :)The Joker. I'm not joking when I say this could be the first time that two different actors could win an Oscar for playing the same character.Now the Joker is one of the most iconic villains of all time, but do not walk into this expecting it to be a typical comicbook movie with blockbuster action.First and foremost it is a character study of the Joker, of one man's descent into madness, but the terrifying part was just how real it all felt. Arthur Fleck, A Fleck, Affleck? is a really sympathetic character at the beginning of the movie and you really feel for him when you see how mistreated he gets just for being different and misunderstood. Things just keep going from bad to worse for him over the course of the movie until he finally snaps when he gets pushed to the edge.And when he hit Rock Bottom, he rose from the ashes like a Joaquin Phoenix.
Because at the end of the day, this is his movie and he carried it with ease. He has clearly been psychologically scarred, his laugh is something like a tic from a neurological condition and he does have something of an Oedipal complex as well. You can see the Joker's physical and mental transformation when he embraces his madness in all its perverse glory.Speaking of physical transformations, his method acting reminded me of Christian Bale's. His emaciated physique was a bit like the Machinest, and parts of the movie also reminded me of American Psycho and had me questioning what was real and what wasn't.As the whole movie is shot from Joker's perspective, it brings some very interesting twists to the Joker and Batman lore. I'll delve into that more in a spoiler section at the end of this video.The film is also a character study of society as a whole, and although it is set in the fictional city of Gotham in 1982, it's still social commentary for today. Too many people tear down others to feel good about themselves, too many people want to see other people fail, too many people have no empathy. The movie shows the dangers of nihilism that is caused by all of the above, and it shines a light on the importance of mental health treatment.The film also brings credence to the expression ""Don't meet your heroes"", as the public personas so many celebrities have of wanting to help people are really just facades, which is something I've noticed as well.The film was excellently directed by Todd Phillipps and although it was a slow burn, that simmering really gave Joker so much nuance and complexity. The colour palette was very gritty and Gotham-esque and gave the movie a depressed ambience to reflect Arthur's.Overall I'd give joker 4.5/5 Pais, but I'm bumping it up to 5 for Joaqin Phoenix's Oscar Worthy performance.Have you seen Joker yet? What did you think about? How do you compare the Jokers? From Hamill, to Nicholson, to Ledger and now to Phoenix? Let me know in the comments below.Thanks for watching, but if you could hit that like and subscribe button I'll thank you even more. If you haven't seen the movie yet, this is where I say bye for now. But if you have, spoiler talk is coming soon."

Reminds me of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"The movie shows how a neglected common man becomes a criminal for the sake of justice. His way of doing it is through the way of chaos.Though the story connects a lot of dots with the Batman story, but still some things felt as if they were molded to fit the narrative. But overall great watch, the mood, the cinematography, acting, score are all marvelous.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Wonderstruck!,"Heath Ledger's Joker was a monument that embodied the character in a such a way that no other actor could ever dare to accomplish. Now, 11 years later we have an equator to that epic portrayal of the character in the name of Joaquin Phoenix. Believe it when I say.... The walk, the posture, the cold stare, it's all back on the big screen. Joaquin Phoenix brings the clown prince to life in such a way that viewers will have to think twice before blinking. Coming from Director Todd Phillips, *Joker* takes you on a trip to the Humane side of the character, something that no other Joker movie has ever done. *Joker* is the best comic book movie since *The Dark Knight* and one of the finest portrayals of *one man's descent into maddness*. Academy Awards 2020 will be a war between legends. Joaquin Phoenix vs Leonardo DiCaprio and hopefully Robert DeNiro.

Awesome,"Being a big batman guy I always thought the Joker worked better without a backstory. But I also love my dark psychological movies, so this still sounded like it was going to be ace, and it is!This isn't an action movie. It's a character study/back story and it has you feeling both sorry for and being creeped out by Phonex. Who (as everyone is saying) is amazing in the movie.This is a well told, expertly made, gritty drama which grabbed my attention in a way that over the top CGI hasn't for a while now. This film is well paced, unpredictable and shocking in all the right places. DC made the right choice in getting creative and not sticking to the superhero formula here.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Closest to Perfect Story Telling,"Joker - A supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson
Nothing in comparison to the Actors who played joker previously (Not even Considering Jared Leto here)
This character of Arther Fleck (Mentally ill with serious depression and anxiety disorders) stands out as a Class Apart.
The transformation from a Guy that needed Therapy to a Psychotic Killer is unparalleled.
Jokers back story was never fully discussed or shown until this one.
Setting in a time wherein Bruce Wayne is still a Kid.
Arther Fleck is seem fighting a battle of his own within himself that the world/Society chooses to ignore and not care.
This is one movie in a long time that's made me sit through on the edge of the seat without diverting my attention throughout the movie.
Director Todd Philips shine through and truly Deserved that 8minuite Standing Ovation they received at the Premiere.
So much close what we can relate to and that we choose to ignore.
This films Screams right into the heart of every generation.
They must get an Oscar for this one.

Heartbreaking and Disturbing at the same time,"Within the first few minutes you can't help but feel empathy for Arthur, it's heartbreaking to watch the world be so cruel to him and for him to not fit anywhere. The movie takes you on a journey of feeling sad then to feeling disturbed as Arthur devolves into Joker. At the beginning of the movie he states he did best in hospital care, which is where he should've stayed. This is a movie about how society turns its back on people with mental illness and disabilities, giving them no place in this world and making them feel alone and isolated, which is absolutely heartbreaking. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and he deserves to win an award for his performance. If you don't want to watch some of the disturbing stuff, you can cover your eyes like I did, it's pretty obvious when it's about to happen so you can look away if prefer.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

This is actually a REAL movie. Brilliant.,"I can't even describe how I felt while walking out of the cinema. Feelings that I've not felt in a veeeeery long time after watching a movie, reappeared: Happiness, inspiration, deepness. This movie is brilliant. I couldn't believe that FINALLY they created a masterpiece among all the Hollywood that has been coming out lately. I actually was afraid, desillusioned and somewhat sure that this movie would be again just another generic movie, I didn't believe the critics neither. But I'm glad I was wrong. THIS. THIS is the kind of movies that need to be made!!!The scenes drew me in like if they were real, they potrayed everything extremely well. Crude scenes were really disturbing, no horrible soundtrack, no horrible CGI, no shallowness.
The acting was incredible too; prior watching the movie I read some other reviews from ""professional"" critics and they mentioned a lot that the acting was too overwhelming; seriously, WHAT? I think they want some more generic acting or they can't understand what a mentally I'll person actually suffers and how they act. I don't know what is wrong with them, but THIS is the acting that the world actually admires.
Joaquin did a super job and portrayed incredibly well the Arthur to Joker transformation as well as his crude problems.
I'm very grateful that finally we have a real movie.
Absolutely 10/10"
Greatest movie I have ever seen,"As a person who actually went to the theaters, this was an amazing spectacle. To see a somewhat normal man descend into madness was amazing.

Welcome to the Emancipation of Arthur Fleck,"#JokerCaution: The slow burning schizophrenic emancipation of Arthur Fleck will leave you deeply disturbed, mouth agape in some scenes of pure violence, shocking you to the core.Arthur's fall into insanity is like quicksand. It will pull you along with Arthur down the rabbit's hole. You could try and walk out of the theatre but I doubt you will be able to move.For comicbook fans, Arthur Fleck eventually became the Joker, the one man who could not be moved, the one man who saw the evil in everyone. The one man who knew how to push even the White Knights into darkness, while he danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight (!) laughing away in his own terrible pain, his own deep frustrations, his own madness...This movie is about the final leap he took. The leap into sheer madness. You will become mad along with him. So compelling is this portrayal of the Joker.You could blame the apathy of a dying society for the final push. You could blame his mother. You could blame his colleagues.But in the end, Arthur doesn't blame anyone. Not even the demons in his head.By the end of it all, he learns to dance with them...You can see him do that dance in the end, without saying a word. His deep mad eyes speak it out as if he's shouting it in your face.It will shake you up. It will make you cry.Because you and I, are a part of the Society that drove Arthur to become the Joker...I have never been so disturbed by a movie. I've seen some of the most horrific movies as part of my quest for understanding cinema.This movie is a first. It brings tears to my eyes to write this. You will feel sad for Arthur's madness, twist your heart with the pain he felt.But you will also feel the sheer murderous horror that Arthur becomes. Like an Antichrist rising from the fires of our collective apathy and the death of our tired souls.P. S. To sit through this movie took all of my love for cinema. I have never been so much in awe, ever."
Remarkable,I was skeptical about this movie because I though it would be too difficult to give justice to the character of Joker comparing it to the amazing performance of Heath Ledger. But Joaquin managed to do that remarkably.I didn't find the movie disturbing and I love every bit of it. This is by far one of the best movies I've seen.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
He won my vote as the Joker,"As a full pledged Batman fan (ESPECIALLY the animated series), my favorite villian has always been the joker...
Jack N was my favorite personification because he captured the ""clowness"" part of him...
I respected Heith L acting... but, he was NOT the Joker. He was too dark, to somber... too Emo.
But THIS movie wowed me!!
I dont know the kind of reaserch he did (if any) to portray him. But Joaquin Pheonix managed to capture all the key elements of the Joker in a way that makes it real yet maintaing the clown part. I can swear I see features/aspects or scenes from the animated series but grounded to a real life scenario... what would it look like if he was real? It cant be funny funny... he is a psicopath and a killer, but he thinks its all a joke.
Those easter eggs that only I saw, like a ""its just a joke!""... ""sometimes people just dont get it"".
Plus more references made that justified obsessions...
His acting was AMAZING... you can feel his pain and desperation and why he would go crazy and hide behind his clown persona... and you pitty and fear him.
I could SO believe a Harleen Quinzel fall for Joaquin's Joker. NOT that gangster pimp ridiculous attempt.
Even if you are not a Batman fan and don't know or care about the story... you have to recognize the acting. It is a powerfull drama...
And if you are a fan, you have to recognize that he manages to ground him to a real life portrayal while maintaining the comicality of the fact that he ""is"" funny or tries & thinks he is.. a psicopathic clown."

Great build up for explosive ending,"This movie is not about 'how much action can we cram into one sitting', rather, it is about the slow build up of a truly twisted character. Arthur's character is the sole focal point during the entire film, allowing the audience to live through his backstory with no interruptions. The music, dancing, and crude laughter draws you into the world of Arthur, and eventually, the Joker. With that being said, the transformation into the Joker is a very intense and occasionally bloody journey; but, every step of this process has meaning behind it and nothing seemed overly done, or out of place. Some scenes are very dark, but the backstory leading up to them makes them even more impactful when witnessing them on the screen.
I wouldn't know what the correct category for this movie is, but it hits hard in the psychological department as you watch this character's mind explode out of its shell by the end.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Kudos to Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix.For the mainstream critics who think this movie is somehow controversial, instead of blaming movies and video games for potential shooting, think about what really has been happening in our society that pushes people off the edge to do crazy things like that. I think you guys can learn a great lesson from the movie Joker.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Disease as Superficial Power,"This movie dramatizes the sad story of Arthur's mental anguish in which he asks people to call him Joker. He was the victim of abuse in his family, in his employment, and his intimate relationships. He was aware of personal health issues, but he was persistently trying to use his mental problems to his advantage. He was desperately trying to be funny in all kinds and circumstances which resulted in a terrible major realization in a subway accident. Joker was bound by his dreams (or delusions - depending on the viewer's perspective) and his vision of justice. The movie allows the audience to feel the hurt of Joker and horrible consequences of his actions. All artistic tools and contributions involved in this movie make this story full of anxiety and depression. This movie is a perfect companion for autumn melancholy and bad Halloween memories.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Send In The Clown,"So Joker just hit theaters with a whopping amount of money being brought in for the studio during the first weekend.I don't know where to start when talking about this movie, so let's just start with the details. Joker is a movie about a psychopath in the making. It shows how a man suffering from a mental illness was transformed into the clown prince of crime that we all know now as the infamous joker. He has an uncontrollable condition of laughing at the wrong moments.The next point that I am going to make is about the reality of this movie. I believe that this movie was a call for gun violence bans, because it shows that in the wrong hands a gun can be very powerful. This was also a reality call in the sense that mental illness patients are not cared for as much as we should be caring for them, in other words say someone has physical damage everyone's gathering around them and supporting them but when someone has a mental illness they are isolated away from most people.Next up was the violence in this movie. Now the movie wasn't heavy on it but when it was there, there was a lot of blood. What made it worse was when the music playing made it feel suspenseful.After that, there was the feeling you felt when watching this movie. I am not going to lie to you this is a depressing movie, it is sad and he gets constantly beat up whether it's mentally or physically. It is sad and disheartening to see.Next is the director and actors. I believe Todd Phillips did a terrific job when directing this movie, he made it fit in with the comic book origins but still maintained a point of gun violence control. In my opinion he chose a stellar cast. Joaquin Phoenix was one of the best joker actors and, in my opinion, I thought he was one of the best actors, I thought he was at or better than Heath Ledger's portrayal of the ionic character. Another actor that was good in this was Robert De Niro when he represented a character that acted like the late night host Johnny Carson, Robert was outstanding in this movie.A movie that was like this. One of the movies that they brought in to portray this movie, Taxi Driver had the same gritty feel. Don't get me wrong both movies are really good but I believe joker was better.Finally my opinion of it. I believe anyone who just likes a good suspense movie should go watch this. It had a really good plot (not easy to follow, because joker imagines stuff), it had a massive play twists and it was just an overall good movie I would rate it a 10/10, best movie of the year. I am excited to see what the future holds for this version of the joker.Spoiler alert for the next section...My theory of what the ending meant. I believe that the joker was telling the story of the movie to the therapist at the end. He believed that he was the ""Savior"" that everyone needed, to bring laughter and joy to the world. In an allusion I believe Gotham was a Dynamite stick and joker was the fuse."

This IS the only Joker,"This film is 90% Arthur Fleck and 10% Joker. That is not a bad thing because the facts are so organic as they unfold, this becomes the Joker backstory that you never knew you needed.
I'm a huge fan of both of Tim Burton's Batman films, & who doesn't love Jack Nickolson? But this Joker gets moved to the front of all the lines, and makes Heath Ledger's J look contrived.
I was never a fan of his interpretation.
Let's not even mention the one-who-shall-not-be-named in the most recent J in Suicide Squad. Trash. Complete trash.And, if you're a fan of Villain Dances like I am, this one is EPIC. It is awkward in the most real & vulnerable way and then rises to Mick Jagger perfection at the pinnacle.
Conflict & incongruity are what makes the villain dances so mesmerizing. My benchmark has always been creepy Mr Blond from Res Dogs when he's gleefully torturing the street cop, but Sam Rockwell always steals any show with his style anytime he's fulfilling his bad guy rolls. Joaquin and his villain dance aren't so forthright, it takes a few tries and he doesn't get it right every time, that's what makes the scene on the stairs so powerful & almost orgasmic. It's a glimpse into what his complete transformation will look like once he's embraced his alter ego, fully.
There's some other fun facts? that will shake up the DC Universe if you pay attention to details.
This film will absolutely be triggering to anyone who has suffered abuse, neglect, bullying, apathy from ppl supposed to help, or just downright inhumane treatment.
Send in the Clowns."
"""The worst part of having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave like you don't!""","Never did I expect ""Joker"" to have the impact on me it did! I went in expecting a grandiose, dark and twisted character study with a top notch lead performance and came out richly rewarded with that and so much more. Not only does ""Joker"" provide us with a unique take on the origins of The Joker, it also provides us with an in-depth character study on mental illness and the corrupt, narcissistic and anarchic society we all live In, but some of whom struggle to see, through their rose-tinted glasses!
.
The most important message I received which really hit me hard due to my own experiences with mental health and my own somewhat troubled past is the fact that anyone one of us could of potentially been or still could be a semblance of ""The Joker,"" and Todd Phillips has, with this film, presented us with an articulate presentation on what personal trauma could possibly turn someone into the joker and what little is done to prevent such terrible things from unfolding.
.
I cannot help but think, wow, what if my life turned out like that, what if I went through all that pain and suffering, because it's real, this stuff has actually happened and is still happening all over the world. What kind of person would I of turned into? There's only so much a person can take before they snap, and once they do, could you really blame that person for breaking? Especially when the world is already broken. And when society shuns you to the side without listening, helping, supporting or caring, it's just like setting off a ticking-time-bomb, placing it in a busy crowd and then just waiting until it explodes.
.
Let's be honest, people don't want to understand or actually help, some are too scared to accept it and some are too up their own asses to even realise, and then when you finally feel brave enough to try and get medical help, they're just quick to label you with some sort of ""mental illness,"" feed you some crap about how to ""get better,"" prescribe you some meds and then send you on your way, most don't even care about knowing why you're actually feeling like this, and if they don't like what they hear or you're ""too broken,"" they're quick to lock you up without bothering to find the true source of the pain and the actual cause or causes of said issues.
.
I'm not ashamed to say, there were times during this film where tears flooded my eyes due to the pain of Arthur Fleck. It truly broke my heart seeing, nay feeling what he was going through with no help at all, in-fact, quite the opposite; every kick in the gut was quickly followed up with more kicks to the gut, it is not a light story! The screenplay is constantly real, raw and quotable, constantly asking questions that really make you think. The score is riveting and definitely a highlight of the film, every chord that was struck shook me to my core, the soundtrack is pitch-perfect and the cinematography was beautiful and atmospheric.
.
There are truly no words for Joaquins performance, I was and still am completely blown away by his physical transformation and the authenticity of his character. Every scene he's in, just the look of his tormented face and his haunted expressions has you on the edge of your seat, terrified to find out what's going to happen next. How he manages to capture the true essence of Arthur's pain in one single laugh is absolutely harrowing and his delivery of every single line is venomous and of the utmost importance! If he's not atleast nominated for an Oscar, chaos will ensue, just like it did here!
.
The supporting performances where all perfect; they helped express the intensity and severity of the storyline and Joaquin's central performance. The brutality of this film is needed and personally all of the BS circulating this film is unwarranted. You cannot blame a film for potentially influencing violence because of its brutal and dark nature when it's giving a raw depiction of our world we live in now and when one of its main objectives is to shed a little light on what society could/should do to prevent these situations from ever happening. Everyone should see this film for the multiple insightful messages it provides, Joaquin's (fingers-crossed) oscar winning performance and Todd Phillips' unflinching direction! Must See!"
Heartbreaking and COLOSSAL,"I have read a lot of reviews about this film commenting on the cinematography and the music (haunting) and the outstanding direction (Phillips) and acting (Phoenix) but none has expressed how utterly heartbreaking Phoenix's portrayal of a grown man who has suffered child abuse and neglect is - it is physically painful to watch - utterly beautiful and heartbreaking. I felt as if I'd taken him home with me after the film; his all consuming embodiment of the tortured man who is Arthur Fleck attaches itself to you like a needy animal and doesn't let go for days. And then only reluctantly. How he manages this is mesmerising. The violence in the film is gratuitous but feels inevitable and 'justified' given how he has suffered. It is of course coming from a sociopath who so clearly has been created by the neglect of a mother who suffered from mental illness, herself. The violence he inflicts is the manifestation of the utter rage and emptiness he feels. Phoenix lives this onscreen. This is what is so utterly devastating, exhausting, colossal and enveloping about his embodiment of Arthur . And it is an embodiment, not a performance. It's too real to be a performance.
I totally agree with another reviewer who says that if you're not willing to develop you're own thoughts about the subject in a film as dark and vast as this - watch something else. You'll feel it physically but you're brain will try to process what you've just been through, so be prepared.
Utterly transfixed was I for the ENTIRE film. Life changing. And utter kudos to the director and lead actor who were not afraid to show us mental illness and it's heartbreaking affects (extreme though they may be, here) and it's legacy, in all it's deep, dark relentlessness."
Perfect.,"This movie is worth all the praise.
Perfect display from Joaquim.

Only certain people can relate,"In my opinion the purpose of making this joker a film so that people's minds are open, can see it from different sides / perspectives. There is no film that justifies / teaches if the murder is true, it is not possible to teach revenge which is the right thing. So the goal here is how we treat ourselves for other people / people suffering from this disease. while Arthur was on the Murray Franklin show he said 'Thomas Wayne doesn't know that people can be wild' wild which means here are those who don't get justice and want to vent their anger. So my conclusion is that crime not only comes from people's desires but can also be caused by accidental or unwillingness of people about it but only wants to respond accordingly. that's why religion is important. And the creation of the Joker character is due to the people who created their own demons1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A Masterpiece.,"Just got back home from seeing this a second time. I loved it even more. I say this with no exaggeration... This film is a masterpiece. Please go see it, but be prepared for some heavy material. This is a very real exploration of a psychopathic killer. It is extremely violent, and often hard to watch, but always with a purpose. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable. He disappears completely into this character. The evolution we see this tortured man go through would have fallen flat with a lesser actor in the role. Luckily, Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. On the technical end, this film is beautifully shot and Todd Philips' direction is haunting. The story, while familiar, is unique and fresh. Overall, this is the best Joker movie we could have ever hoped for. It's absolutely brilliant.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A Masterpiece of Cinema,"Joker was the film I was most looking forward to this year! To be honest after the high point of Avengers Endgame, I was kind of feeling tired of all these superhero films. Even DC's Shazam (although a fun film) still felt very safe. However, DC had one more film up their sleeves that left me intrigued. No rhyme intended! JOKER! A film starring Joaquin Phoenix as the titular clown prince of crime. I'd always liked the character of the Joker, a phydistic clown who goes around causing mayhem.To me, there had been no definitive version of the Joker. I liked pretty much every interpretation of the Joker each had their own style. From Heath Ledgers mysterious crazed terrorist. Too Cesar Romero's clumsy clown. Heck, I even like Jared Leto's portrayal. That's why I was looking forward to see what Joaquin Phoenix could bring to the table.When the first trailer was released early this year, I was very pleased too see that this film was going for a dark gritty mature tone. It was a chance for DC to develop their most beloved villain with no restrictions. The Joker is insane and having us be able to see his violent crime would impact the general audience even more than any prior incarnation.The news that this was also going to be a standalone film with no connections to the DCEU excited me even more as the film could be itself without having to connect to a larger universe. At this point my hype was through the roof and it Id had to wait a few more months until I could see it.On October 5th I sat down to watch a film that promised to be an achievement in film. So after the film came to its conclusion I was left in me seat stunned. What a masterpiece!The film is an interesting intense depressing journey into the mind of the man who was going to become the Joker. It's about a man rejected by society and his revenge against. To me it felt refreshing to have comic book fill that felt nothing like a traditional comic book film. It felt like a psychological thriller. It felt refreshing. Not entirely new though. It took a lot of inspiration from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy and it is so obvious but this isn't necessarily a bad thing as it takes the best aspects of those films and greats a film which is shocking and thought provoking. The film is shot amazingly. Every shot has a purpose and it adds to the overall tone of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Joker and Arthur Fleck. You may be wondering why I refer to the Joker and Arthur Fleck as two different characters as to me these two sides of the same person are very different. And yesI'll say it again he deserves an Oscar for his performance. Robert De Niro is also an amazing addition to the cast he plays a late night talk show host called Murray Franklin and encompasses everything about a talk show host is about. He plays quite a significant role in Arthur's story and helps him become Joker. The supporting cast is also good but don't steal the show like Phoenix which is good because it's he movie.If your going into Joker thinking this is going to be your typical superhero action film your going to be very disappointed. Also, if you want to watch a film where the Joker commits crimes and antagonises the caped crusader this isn't the film for you. The Joker isn't even in the film to the very end of the film but boy is it good when he emerges. But I digress this film is about how the man becomes the Joker not about the Joker. Yes it's misleading to call the film joker but that's the point. However Joker is a marvellous piece of cinema and deserves to be given a chance. That's why I give it the highest rating of 10/10"
Oscar nomination please,Joaquin Pheonix became the joker in this 100%. He put on an amazing performance. He portrayed the effects of mental illness and the effects society can have on someone. Brilliantly done. Wish he killed more people though. Hopefully theres another one. Joaquin in NOW the joker!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
Who would have thought that Joker could be relatable!,"What would happen if someone took a beloved villain and rewrote their entire history? Surely, at first everyone would freak, because of the caricature of the character recent adaptions have offered. This is not the case here. Joker is what happens when they take a well worn character and they actually develope them, not just give them a modern day outlook but without the respective way of thinking. Basically it is like the writer thought how would the Joker be created today, without the toxic wastes. In my opinion, Joker is a brilliant combination of comic book accuracy and innovation, giving modern means and conditions to the villain we know (if after watching the movie we can still call him that), while also staying true to what makes the character tick.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"This movie is like no other, just utterly amazing","All I have to say is watch this movie and do not expect it to be like the joker your originally know or any other superhero/villain move you have seen because this one is a masterpiece in its own realm that no other movie could touch. From start to finish this movie keeps you locked in. You always felt like something crazy was about to happen, and you wont be wrong, if you love thrills mixed with grim laughter this movies is for sure for you. If you cant stand blood or dark movies and expect it to be a lovey dovey Marvel esque movie then it might not be for you. I like a lot of Marvel movies even more than DC movies, but this one has to be up their with greatest of all time hero/villain movies ever.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"A cinematic masterpiece, though gut wrenching","I have never thought to rate a movie. Personally, no movie comes to mind other than this title that is really worth raving about so ceaselessly as I've done since I saw it in theaters. I'll admit that I have no previous interest in superhero/villain movies, comics, etc, and I never really got into the whole Batman thing, BUT this film has me impressed. It's a different breed, and that's what I like about it. It explores the mind of a struggling man in a troubled life, and Joaquin Phoenix plays the part phenomenally. It's believable, it portrays interesting examples of what may happen with a mental illness, and the emotion I drew from it had me squirming in my seat. Many parts were uncomfortable, yes, but that may be because I'm a sensitive person, and the movie inducing this feeling isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seeks out emotion and sympathy.
I'm no great and knowledgeable movie critic, as I stated prior, but I did enjoy Joker enough to go as far as to make an IMDb account just to rate the movie. I enjoyed it that much. I do plan on purchasing a DVD of the film as soon as possible and giving it a re-watch.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A startling reveal about an iconic villain,"The joker says more about society than we'd want to know. A terrible, monstrous masterpiece. A must watch.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A mirror that nobody wants to look at.,"I'll let other people focus on the incredible cinematography, nuanced acting, superb writing and detailed score. It's all amazing in my vastly unqualified opinion. What I'd like to offer my thoughts on is the underlying, cultural importance of this stunning, Kafkaesque caricature of life in an often solitary bubble that we somewhat ironically refer to as civilisation. It is the story of a man stripped to nothing but the subjective will to power without restriction, à la Nietzsche's 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra'. The introjected values that tether Arthur Fleck to society are diminished when they are not reflected in the behaviour of others that continuously overlook and mistreat him on account of his illness. He is relentlessly denied autonomy, agency, self-determination and subjectivity by a cold and abusive world until his climactic metamorphosis as this nightmarish, maniacal overman. I think the violence in the film speaks to a part of the viewer that we actively suppress because of our own introjected values and conditions. We leave the cinema and go about our day accepting that we've just witnessed an exciting, moving and deeply upsetting fiction. Yet in our dissonance between the aroused exhilaration and disgust, we are forced to acknowledge the very conditions that keep us in check within our role in society. It is a kind of thought experiment which ultimately highlights a very clear truth; society has a responsibility for it's own mental health, even more so to those that we have neglected and let down to the point that they break catastrophically. The upset and outrage inspired by the film is sort of the whole point. A film or videogame can't inspire violence in the meek, passive members of society who's sensibilities and expectations tell them that what they are seeing is horrific and unsettling. That's absurd. Equally, it can't inspire disturbing behaviour in those with the capacity to go out into the world and commit such acts. That darkness was already there, and it was foreshadowed by a lifetime of trauma and neglect. No, Joker doesn't beckon the bogeyman and instruct him to wreak havoc on the world. It simply holds a mirror up to society, showing us that the bogeyman is already here. We don't like what we see in our dire reflection because we were comfortable here in our faux, utopian soft play of ignorance and dismissiveness. It comes as no surprise that the establishment are already railing against this message, because they are the most comfortable of all. Let's not forget that we live in a world where pivotal books such Robert Cormier's The Chocolate War and Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower are still routinely removed from libraries. Yet, this bosom world in which we nestle is a fiction in itself. We value society because it offers protection, but what about the times when it fails? What about the neglected and the marginalised? Those that do commit radical acts of violence have ultimately been let down by the very social contract that promises to protect them, and it is on all of us to do something about it or accept our responsibility for the consequences. Joker is more than just a very important and timely admission of our shortcomings. It is a call to action; Not for revolution or civil unrest, but for compassion."

Masterpiece!!,Joker(2019) is not the conservative take on clown price of crime's origin story. The story is not related to comic book but everyone after watching this movie will forget about everyone who has played joker before joaquin pheonix. The film is dark and depicts arthur fleck's daily struggle with society while simultaneously fighting with a rare medical which corners him from society. The film portrays how a failed stand-up comedian turns criminal and what circumstances made him to do so. Joaquin pheonix is legendary in the movie his performance is on another level. He has made himself eternal as the Joker. In future when we will talk about joker we will most probably think of joaquin phenix's portrayal than any other one out there. The movie is a masterpiece and will be remebered as a cult classic for sure.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

An inward look psychological rollercoaster.,"Managing to stay true to the comics in an origin sorry based on the joker is tricky, due to the very nature of the character and the lack of knowledge of his former life which we have to go on. Without spoiling anything, much of this movie takes place in the viewers own mind. Leaving more questions by the end than you had going in, the movie manages to pull off showing us the Jokers history, while having us question if what we are seeing is in any way real, or if it depicts the character we think we all know. There are a few nods to the batman comics, but it isn't a batman movie in any way. Really, it isn't even a joker movie. It's a movie about a fractured mind in a fractured world, and it's self imposed confirmation, slowly becoming a character we both love and loath. Creepy, disturbing, intense. Phoenix really nails this version of the character, but also manages to capture the lonely, sad life of Arthur, leading us to fully understand, and both completely misunderstand the journey he takes during the course of the film.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

An absolute masterpiece. Critics are offended by this movie and here's why....,"I will start off by saying I had very high hopes for this movie, but was not expecting it to live up to the hype. Neither was I expecting Joaquin Phoenix to even get close to measuring up to Heath Ledger's Dark Knight performance. I will admit I am a huge fanboy of Ledger, so when I say that Phoenix blew me away and gave an equally amazing performance in this film and that this movie is probably the best movie made during this decade, I absolutely mean that.This movie is more than just an origin story. It's an in depth view of how someone becomes a villain and the factors that lead to it. To start off, yes, Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker, is mentally unstable and suffers a condition that forces him to laugh in situations he shouldn't laugh in. Mix this with his anxiety, he is put in positions that are extremely uncomfortable that he doesn't want to be in. It also doesn't help that his social worker doesn't listen to him and is disgruntled by the fact that the government she works for doesn't value her profession enough to keep it alive. Arthur Fleck is a good person at heart in the beginning and is trying his absolute best to be happy and make people happy. But as the movie goes on, his attempts to do everything in his power are crushed, and ultimately, he hits a breaking point, leading the Joker to become a psychotic murderer.This above mentioned point is why I think critics and the media are quick to dismiss this movie, because it does not fit the ""guns and weapons"" are the problem narrative. If you look at any tragedy that happens, what get blamed? The weapon, or ideology in 99% of the cases. The media does this because it advances an agenda that they align themselves with. Heaven forbid the people committed the crime was actually just mentally ill and just looking for validation for their actions. Or better yet, will get recognition and fame from, you guessed it, the media.Now, where does the Joker fit in to the above mentioned point? Why I loved this movie so much is that the Joker sees validation for his actions. At first, the first murder is shocking, he's scared, and honestly the first murders could be justified as self defense. But as the media portray's the support he receives, he starts to think that what he is doing is ok, and ultimately there are some people that view him as a hero. Why, because the media allowed this happen and society validated it by supporting him.Aside from this point, the movie itself is phenomenally done. This is hands down the best origin story to have been made. It's brutally honest, it's dark, it's violent, and very uncomfortable at times. Phoenix's performance is the best I've ever seen him do. He deserves the Oscar, and quite honestly this movie deserves best picture. But it probably won't win it because it doesn't 1) Say everyone that is white is a racist or 2) Have a liberal agenda. or 3) Say guns are the reason for mass shootings, 4) Say's ""Orange man bad"".Critics are out of touch, and honestly are an invalid profession. Critic is another word for ""someone who gets paid to share an opinion."" At the time of this review, the movie has a 9.0/10 rating from ~150K users, with a metascore of 58 from less than 100. Listen to the masses instead of the ""Elite"" who claim to know better than you. This movie is worth the viewing."
The king is dead.. Long live the king!,"Despite the title, I'm not going to compare Joaquin's Joker with Heath's here. This is a different film altogether. Heath brought us a beautifully crafted fully formed joker in DK, JP however brings us Arthur Fleck in all his disturbed severely mentally ill glory. It would be like comparing a caterpillar to it's butterfly..It's much less of a comic book movie than a horror film. In fact in parts of the film I forgot I was actually watching the formation of the joker, as Joaquin pulls us so deep into Arthur's illness, it becomes impossible to relate that character to anything remotely 'comic book'.Joaquin Phoenix is exceptional in this movie and he has to be, there is no supporting cast as such for him to hide a shoddy performance, just transient characters that either serve to further provoke or highlight Arthur's illness. Todd Phillips did a marvelous job here of making all of the characters bar Arthur somewhat disposable, they exist but only as a tool for Joaquin to use to craft Arthur. Even Di Nero is a passenger here, his character just used as a catalyst for Arthur's eventual brutal full metamorphosis into Joker. With that said though he plays his role beautifully and it was wonderful to see that man back where he belongs in a piece of cinematic history. The climax of the scene between them is just a thing of absolute movie genius, crafted out by two of our times greatest actors.I'm not sure how the movie got it's 15 rating here in the UK. The violence though not continuous is disturbing in it's realism, indeed the whole film felt 'adult'. It's definitely not a 15 that I'd be letting my 13 year old son watch anytime soon. I guess it's a box office thing!In all honesty though as much as I loved this film, I don't know if I could give it a second watch. Maybe that will change over time but right now I feel it's a movie like the usual suspects or seven.. I want to hold onto the surprise of this film, because I went in expecting something entirely different to what I was presented with.Joaquin's always been a slightly underrated actor for me. He's been nominated for three academy awards, most notably of which were best actor for Walk the line and best supporting actor for Gladiator, but has won none. His portrayal of Commodus especially was deserving of an Oscar. Tell me a movie villain you've ever hated more than that? I struggle to find one personally!! He MUST get an Oscar for this performance!!"
A bothering movie,"We lack so much of true, unrestricted art nowadays because of our seemingly growing attachement to ""morallity"" that questioning the status quo is seen like a threat to society,its like a new form of the old inquisition has grown legitimately beetween us so naturally, like it has back on the medieval age, that no one seems to notice. And the funny thing is that the movie seems to be so precise in its point of view that it has provoked a response in the actual system exactly as it would in the ficcional, from the movie. The people in control really want to control what we see and know in an almolst utopian level that is hard to believe. The morallity made critics and a part of the people who watched and were not ready for the thruth contained in the movie to dabate a possible censorship of the film, as it was even legal to do so with a piece of art.
Unfortunately, the opressive force of society really gets real nasty sometimes, and even now so many people ignore it. I, as a graduate from med school, can say from my little experience in a psychiatric ward that the plot, the movie, and the character doesn't seem as nearly insane as its beeing talked about when you know and understand what gets someone ""crazy"". Its real sad to see that society believes its evolving so fiercely, when its actually dehumanizing itself to a terrorrizing level just because we refuse to see the truth that surrounds us, and then call it morrally correct. Thats why the film bothers a few people so much, its not about the glorifiyng of violence or caos, its because it shows how the system breaks a man(even though it might seem exagerated to people who haven't seen it for real) and thats why it has to be seen."
Can I get another ticket please?,"The movie just made me feel to go back to the ticket desk and ask for another ticket for the following session. It was such a great journey to Joker's life. The acting of Joaquin, photography, colors, musics were just more than enough. It actually made me respect again for acting, directing and shooting a movie. The movie was an art.

Very powerful and enlightening! !,"I guess many people have misunderstood this movie and I believe only those who have been exposed to such conditions will fully understand its message.

I didn't care much about the violence or darkness rather than focusing on ""soul killing"" and being ""not afraid of losing anymore"" because of all the tragedies that joker passed through, the violence and the extreme incidents are just there to make the message more powerful and enlighten the minds of people who never passed through such conditions.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Joker a masterpiece of our time,"Joker. The Joker is quite an extraordinary Film. I was stunned when I saw it in the cinema. The sheer depth of the movie was mind-blowing and in the good way. I can see why the Americans don't favourite is for me it is simply too deep for them, there so shallow they can see the depth in the movie.
Joker is more like a European film than a dis American it's a stand-alone film ma that shows depth and perfect character development. we can see Arthur going from going from hiding himself in a shell that he calls Arthur but he unleashes what has always been hidden under Arthur in the end of the movie The Joker.

Sickeningly Superb,"It's rare for a film to stay with me into the next day, but this was such a powerfully disturbing, brilliantly acted story that I was thinking about it on and off for a long time.

Watch This Film!!!!!,"I want to be completely honest in giving my review of this film. I am a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but I was not very excited about this project. I believed the DC tales of Batman and the Joker were overly exhausted to the point they were no longer entertaining. I wholeheartedly thought I would hate this film.
With that said, I was completely shocked with the depth in story telling, phenomenal acting, and brilliant dialogue delivered by this film.
This is not a superhero/ villain story. This story goes much deeper into societal norms which are troubling and in many cases disturbing, but routinely go overlooked. This story dives into the psyche of a person who has experienced physical, emotional, and mental trauma at the hands of a society that really doesn't value him as a person and thus discards him completely as a sort of joke.
The politics associated with this film are very familiar and relevant to what we see and experience in today's political climate.
Some fear that those in power may see it as a threat towards the status quo, while those who feel oppressed may see it as a call to arms.
I completely understand why media is trying to discourage people from seeing this film; it is not because it doesn't deliver, but because it really does. This is a film that makes one pause, think and acknowledge that there are situations in this world that require us to be more human. It also opens our eyes to the class systems which still exist in our societies and how change is necessary to disrupt and eradicate those unfair and unjust systems.
I recommend everyone go see this film! 👍🏼👍🏼"

Insanely twisted.,"I went into this movie with VERY high expectations because of all the rave reviews and controversy and I as not disappointed at all. In fact it exceeded my expectations. I've never seen a more gritty, dark and twisted movie in my life.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is probably one of the best if not THE BEST acting performances I've ever seen. He is by far the best joker so far. From the Joker's laugh, mannerisms, down to the way her runs. Joaquin perfected it all. He definitely deserves every award this coming season. Heath Ledger would be proud.Just don't watch it expecting an action packed comic movie. It's all about the joker's origin and his slow decent into insanity. It's so unsettling and uneasy I can see why some people walked out. It's a very brutal and honest look at mental illness and how society treats people with it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A Psychological Journey,"The film presents the mysterious psychological journey of Joker. It represents how society, family and workmates could trigger the criminality of one's mind. Arthur Fleck is presented as a victim of the world's tragedy forming up what he called a comedy. We could only refer to his suffering as an audience through our own bad experiences and we could relate to him in a way or two.

Descend into madness with Joaquin Phoenix!,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece of cinema with an amazing score and filmography that shows the fall to insanity rather than telling you. I expect ""Joker"" to have a cult following for years to follow, a must-see movie on the list of many. It was an amazing, entertaining, and impressionable film that the audience will take home to ponder and discuss. The film depicts talent in story-telling and performance. I genuinely didn't want the movie to end; Joaquin Phoenix is so mesmerizing to watch on screen (playing the joker to the highest standard I've seen thus far) that I would be disappointed if the academy looks over his performance. I'm calling for an Oscar! And a sequel! The ""Joker"" is the best movie I've seen this year, and it'll be the best movie you've seen this year too. Get a ticket and descend into madness!

First Impressions: One to Think About,"""Knock knock...""Joker is about Arthur Fleck, he's a disturbed and formerly hospitalized clown in Gotham City who lives with his sick mother he takes care of. He also has aspirations of being a stand up comic and is a big fan of the Murray Franklin Show, Gotham's big TV late night talk show and after a video of Arthur's bizarre stand up act gets shown on the show... he's invited to be appear on the show for an interview.So I JUST saw this movie....And... it's all still flushing around in my head so I'm having a hard time writing a proper review for it. I keep starting to write and then I start over and so on... so I wouldn't call this a review, more ""first impressions"".Because there's a lot to get into with this movie and there's things to discuss.I got home from Avengers: Endgame and knew exactly what I thought about it.Joker... I don't know, I need some time and maybe even to see it again. Maybe in IMAX which I can't BELIEVE Warner Bros put the time and effort into making an IMAX version of THIS movie...But... I liked it... might have even loved it.... but it's not perfect. It's not the R-rated Joker movie of my dreams.... which would kinda just be The Dark Knight but with blood. Like I already GOT my perfect Batman AND Joker movie in 2008 so anything after that is a nice bonus.There's nothing in it I disliked but... it never hit heights I would have hit if I was given the keys to the Gotham City kingdom. For one thing, it's a shockingly small movie, hence my slack-jawed reaction to finding out that right now people are watching this in IMAX.It's a psychological thriller, it's not a horror movie or a crime drama. It's a drama about an insane person.The movie it reminded me of the most wasn't even the Scorsese movies Todd Phillips says he was inspired by but One Hour Photo. This is a 2 hour movie where the only guy we're with is a complete psychopath.There's no hero in this movie. There's no relief, there's nobody trying to stop the Joker. So the worse he gets, the more tense the movie gets because we know there's no Batman or Commissioner Gordon coming to the rescue here. So this makes for a pretty unpleasant movie.Joaquin Phoenix gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Joker and he might even win for this movie. Is he better than Heath Ledger? No.... but it's SUCH a different version of the character it's not even comparable.... which brings me to maybe my main complaint with this movie....I think.... this movie would be a LOT better.... if it were not called Joker. I think knowing it's The Joker I had so many expectations of where this movie would take this character and that kinda hurt my first viewing.Maybe on a rewatch that'll go away completely but I kept thinking this movie would play better if you didn't know you were watching a movie about the Batman villain The Joker until the final act. Because I certainly kept expecting a lot more... Joker-y type stuff in this movie and it really doesn't tap into the Joker I'm familiar with.This isn't a criminal mastermind mixed with a serial killer with a permanent smile, it's not Nicholson's Joker or Ledger's Joker.... it's a whole new thing.It really is more of a Joker origin story than a Joker movie. Like this entire movie almost feels like the first act of a proper Joker solo movie. I REALLY hope they make a sequel because as much as I enjoyed elements of it I wanted way more.Lack of Batman is not the issue here at all, by the way. Joaquin Phoenix does more than enough to carry the movie on his own but.... at the end of the day I wanted more of a horror movie, more of a crime movie.What we GOT was very good..... but I can't help but think it could have been better.This is not a proper concise review, I might be able to have one in the near future. Because like I said there's loads to get into.But I'll say I liked what I saw... but I need more time to process it.I'm definitely VERY curious to hear what others think of Joker."

must be a joke to vote this down,"First review for me,but i had to do it for the non-thinkers.
no spoilers here,even if you watch several trailers,like i did,it is packed with action! -no,not the headless running around cgi-kind that fills our minds with nonexistent bullcrap theese days. i.am a long time fan of comics(never looked at joker like this) and hate the disaster movies lately. heroes in comics did not kill half of the population while bringing the bad guy down. that anyone goes on with their lifes,smiling at the hero saving the day but missing 3/4 of their families.i mean,i get it now,while i.am writing,why people don.t like it. because they maybe expected that joker starts jumping around 20 feet up in the air,ripping of buildings and eating humans,or at least cars.to smash half of the city and being chased down by cgi-bats. and it.s because this is a true movie,about a true character. it is so real,you can almost touch the world he is living in-because it is actually our world. a bit of fresh air for as long as i can.t remember. just when i thought,there will be no true movies any more. THIS ONE,my friends,will make you think about society and yourself.then again,people don.t think any more. they just want to be lied to and fed with cgi-popcorn and vr-juice. but in the end,it.s ok...it.s not a movie for everyoneif you look at it and admit it.s a perfect picture of us and what this world is we are living in,it.s a win. if you want impossible jumps and disaster packed ""hero""-film,go see everything else.oh,and one more thing in regard of vigilante. i love the fact that joker is(or,at least starts of with)cleaning people that are just garbage of society (the ""superrats""),and that before any other self proclaimed rich justice leader. for me,he is the first vigilante of all. used to look up to batman in my childhood and later too, but this ladies and gents ""is what you get..."",and it.s a mature film for those who lived enpugh to experience the society we live in.tonight was the second time I saw it and it's getting better.edit:watched it 5x...and the acting is outstanding. it.s my fav.movie now...because of J.P. what he did here,if you are a movie fan,you can not oversee it. it.s magnificent,tons of moments of real emotions. this is cinema at it.s best"
Film of the Year,"A cinematic event to be remembered - with themes of mental illness, bullying, the subjective nature of comedy, mob mentality/political outrage, trauma, murder, rich vs poor and an Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, JOKER makes for a disturbing, stressful, uncomfortable 2 hours that will leave you thinking about the blurred lines between good people and bad people, and the people who pretend to be good and the good people that become bad.Out of this world sound design and cinematography make this a must-watch if you can handle it.

I am moved by how well Joaquin brings this comic character to life and creates an image of a believable human being who doesn't want to be a victim anymore. There are several thought provoking elements in this movie - like, this is what happens when you place a gun into the hands of a mentally and emotionally lost and drainef person.

Chilling,"This rendition of the Joker is absolutely nuts! That is simply the only rational way to describe. I went into the movie with very high expectations, and may I say those expectations have been exceeded. The way Phoenix portrays him is so incredible, and the scariest part is that he managed to humanize this psychopath and almost make you pity him. I left the movie theater in a state of shock, not completely comprehending the beauty I just saw.
Another thing which was done so beautifully in this movie was the way that it strayed away from the DCU and comic book movies as a whole. If this film could be closely related to any film prior it would be ""Taxi Driver"" by Martin Scorsese. All in all, it was incredible movie that is more than likely to make some serious noise at the upcoming oscars!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Captivating and unpredictable,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie. I've heard complaints about pacing or the first hour ""dragging on"", but those claims are likely by those expecting an action movie. The film did an amazing job showing Phoenix's descent into madness every step of the way, almost causing you to root for and empathize with the Joker. Joaquin brought new elements to the clown prince of crime, and this movie will sit atop my list for as long as I can see.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Whole new level,"I believed all of the hype and went to this movie with extremely high expectations. This movie exceeded them in every aspect possible. All I can hope for now is to see Joaquin in another film as the Joker. This movie was so dark and disturbing which I felt was the best part. Unreal character development, unbelievable soundtrack and eerily relevant to modern day problems. I fee the critics were afraid to give this movie better reviews just in case there is some public backlash. Very risky film in today's climate.

Best Joker portrayal ever!!!,"I was so looking forward to seeing this film and oh boy was I NOT disappointed, everything about it is first class from the storyline the main characters development and the music score is brilliant. As soon as it was over I wanted to see it again. yes Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar he is a fantastic character actor, this film has made me want to go and watch all of his films.

One of the best performances I've ever seen. Puts others to shame.,"I usually hate origin stories for bad guys. I don't need to know why they ended up that way. Prometheus in my opinion ruined the Aliens but Joker is something else. Jacquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Some scenes are just uncomfortable to watch and that's all down to him. Now don't get me wrong, it's not like the way 'requiem for a dream' is uncomfortable to watch it's the fact that it's played straight makes him so unsettling. As in this is not the Jack Nicholson or Jared Leto over the top super villians versions...this is a man suffering from severe mental illness turning psychotic and it's grounded in reality. This version could happen. That's the unsettling thing. Enjoyed trying to keep an eye out for any DC comics history references. Shame on all the people complaining and trying to censor this movie by saying its dangerous and glorifying the villians. It does no such thing........and by the way.......... it's just a movie.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Joaquin Phoenix killed it so good.,"The Joker is not a role model. He never was, never will be. His actions aren't justified, and neither were they right. But before the make-up and purple suit came on, before the blood-smirked smile formed shape, and before he got crowned as the Clown Prince of Crime, maybe the Joker was human. Maybe he was Arthur. And Joaquin Phoenix as joker and this movie makes us feel for him.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Amazing,"After seeing the trailer my hopes were sky high and, because of that, I was a bit worried how it would turn out. But, now that I've seen it, I can gladly say it did NOT disappoint. To be quite frank, it actually surprised me how raw and unsettling the movie is, even though I was expecting something around these lines. Joaquim is amazing the entire time, he's sad and depressed and you can watch the Joker growing inside him as the movie progresses. A few tímes it feels over the top, like too many coicidences happening at once, but when compared with the greatness of everything else it just seems like nitpicking.
After the backlash this movie went through with the media and stuff, I'm thankfull it wasn't a disaster. 'Joker' is just as the movie itself, a survivor in a clown world. Go see for yourself, it's a dark take on a great villain, and it doesn't let you down.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Braced for something else, but its about class warfare","""Joker""
Portrays mental illness in a society about to explode with the divisions between haves and have-nots. I expected a movie like ""The Stand"".
This was better, like a disguise in title.....
Depressing in the beginning, it slowly builds understanding and perhaps sympathy of the focal character. It has definite ""A Clockwork Orange"" feel to it. Similar in dysfunction, similar in ultra violence.

One of the greatest films I have ever seen,"So i have seen it twice now with a heavy probability of going a few more if im being honest here.Its haunting, its brilliant, its tragic, its beautiful, its funny, its dark, its sad, its funny...its Joker.We have finally been blessed with every iteration of the joker their is. From the clown and the gangster, to the anarchist and the unhinged, but now we finally have the madman and the showman. Phoenix brought everything to this performance and with Phillips crafted a Joker thats elegant and chilling. Both times I have seen it I have walked away with more questions and more theories. But theres a grace in Phoenixs performance. A dance. He glides through these scenes
In a way i thought no actor would do with the joker. Its beautiful and painful and a pure expression of the soul. The bathroom scene alone...awestriking. (not a spoiler its in the trailer) Phoenix has done it folks. Ledger would be so proudI cant remember the last time i have seen a movie this good. Elements of the godfather, taxi driver, king of comedy, the killing joke, the dark knight/the dark knight returns, mark hamil, a clockwork orange, requiem for a dream, one flew over the cuckoos nest, psycho, silence of the lambs...the list goes on.The MUSIC and the cinematography are truly some of the best I had ever seen. You are left powerlessly mystified by Phoenix and Phillips dedication to the project.
Its a masterpiece in every sense of the word
Nothing in the last year or hell the last decade even TOUCHES how great this movie is...Its not for everybody thats for sure, its a stiff drink to swallow.I remember everybody being surprised when i said Endgame was not the comic book movie i was waiting for in 2019. I knew there was something special about this movie when i saw the screen test.
Never in my life would I think a movie like this would exist...but it does....and people are starting to notice..."
"A beautiful, unique representation of a different type of Joker.","I walked into the cinema with high hopes and I left completely fulfilled. I'm a massive Batman fan - both in comics, movies and television - and I was eager to see this latest iteration. I've enjoyed many portrayals of the Joker, from Nicholson to Ledger to Hamill. Each one showcases a different element of the Joker.Joaquin manages to present another side, whilst drawing from many aspects of the previous iterations. He plays on the mental side, showcasing a Joker developed out of circumstance. I feel Ledger's ambiguous Joker worked fantastically - which left you querying his reasons and mentality. This Joker is outright - you know his motivations and the film is a rollercoaster depicting that journey. He's a broken man with the weight of the world becoming overbearing - his fantasies so real that when they come crashing down with reality even I could sympathise with him.The art, setting and location were fantastic. Gotham felt real and dangerous, exactly as I'd picture a pre-Batman Gotham. The depiction of Thomas Wayne felt unique in that he was depicted more as a Trump-style capitalist rather than benevolent philanthropist although as his depiction is from the perspective of Arthur, it's possible he may not be as bad as depicted.I get the criticism based around the violence and how it utilises mental illness - it's very much topical and given recent and past events it was always going to dip into controversy. But I feel that it will be appreciated more once it settles. It is perhaps the ""Killing Joke"" of Joker movies."

Unexpected,"Going into the cinema I expected to give this 8 or 9 out of 10 because I know Joaquin Phoenix is a 5 star actor and I read several reviews of this movie before, most praised the cinematography. I came out from it with a 11/10 if possible.This is not just a movie. From score, story to cinematography, everything has been crafted so beautifully. But what struck me so hard is the acting, especially Joaquin Phoenix. I don't see him at all on the screen, Joaquin is totally disappeared. All I see is Joker, a character so complex and so real. From the legs shaking, sometimes hands tapping down to the way his eyebrow raising, it's a perfect Joker.Now that the movie has ended, so is Joker. You would not see even a bit of it on Joaquin Phoenix. That's the epitome of great actor.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Marmite film,"First review I've ever done on iMdB but I have to say this to everyone, this film is a marmite film; people will either love it or hate it.Many people will go in with the expectations of being on-par with The Dark Knight, but these two films are completely incomparable in their own right.The Dark Knight is a COMIC film, it involves all the action and all the pieces of comic stories put into an action masterpiece, and Heath Ledger's performance is extraordinary as the clown prince of crime.Joker is an extremely disturbing, dark yet invigorating film which shines the light less on the impact of Bruce Wayne and the Joker's battle with one another - it instead showcases an ill mans descent into madness, and shows how his past-experiences have effected him throughout his troubled life. Personally, I think if they moved away from some of the DC-orientated parts of the film it would've been better, but.. it is a film about THE JOKER.Overall I am absolutely amazed with Joaquin Phoenix's performance, it is truly Oscar-Winning and his portrayal consists mainly of the characters ill-nature rather than a complete psychopath.Should you go and see this film? YES.
But don't compare it to The Dark Knight, this film is not an action film, it is a gripping thriller and a dramatic masterpiece."
Phenomenal!,"The movie focused on so many important features that most people will experience atleast once in their lifetime. It showed outstanding scenes of someone suffering with mental health, bullying, gun violence, the health/support system in the US, poverty, growing up without a father and abuse. The movie was incredible but deep! I loved the quotes said throughout the movie it gave the audience such an inside look on someone who sees so differently of the world because of what they've been through.

Mesmerising,"3 observations1. This film is exhausting to watch. It pulls on every emotion for the entire duration and leaves you questioning your own morals, ethics and world view2. It is by far the finest characterisation in modern cinema - Phoenix is utterly brilliant, every second of every minute he is on screen.3. You can't help but think with the world in such a precarious state, this is a dangerous film. The usual random, motiveless or opportunistic portrayal of crime is replaced with a narrative that draws empathy and support. The things that underpin the characters development happen in real life, in every city, in every country, the world over. Joker dares to suggest there is an alternative and lays out the blueprint.Enjoy the film, it is truly a masterpiece but don't be surprised if clowns become popular again. 😀"

Phoenix has took the Joker to another level. THE HYPE IS REAL.,"When the initial teaser trailer came out, 6 months ago or however long it may be, I was skeptical of this take on the ""Joker"". The final trailer for it intrigued me massively, and I thought wow, this actually looks pretty good. Then the initial reviews came out, the fact it had gotten a standing ovation in 8 minutes, surely it is all hype? Surely it isn't THAT good?Boy was I wrong, Joker is a tremendous film, that is what sets it apart from other ""comic"" movies, this is not a great movie based on a comic character, it is a great film overall, period. Phoenix' acting is utterly stupendous, breathtaking, and worthy of an Oscar no doubt. The movie itself is dark, disturbing, gritty, and uncomfortable at times, and leaving the cinema, this is one of the rare movies which made me think about what I had seen in a deep manner.

FANTASTIC,"Joker (2019) delivers a masterclass of acting by Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck and tells a deep and meaningful narrative in relation to society today. Joaquin Phoenix allows the audience to not only understand and empathise with the character 'Joker', but to also feel repulsed by some of the extreme actions he takes. When critics compare it to Heath Ledger, or downplay Joaquin Phoenix's character as an incel or angry white guy, they are sorely mistaken and most likely misunderstood the narrative of the film. Heath Ledger's Joker was a brilliant take on the character but you must understand that the 2019 Joker is introduced in a more psychologically engaging manner, where we are able to directly see Arthur's life before he became the joker. Whereas in the Dark Knight, the audience is only able to see the Joker post origin. If you think about it, the Dark Knight's joker has had many years to perfect his violent strategies, but Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is quite literally about the beginning of he Joker and what caused it.Put it simply, comparing the two Jokers would be unnecessary and irrelevant as they are focusing on the character in completely different parts of their lives.
No need to attack the film because it felt uncomfortable and real, this film was designed with that in mind and to make the audience think long and hard about the society they live in, including mental illness in contemporary society."
A Masterpiece,"First of all get this man an Oscar because he certainly deserves it . Man the movie was much more than I expected, after the movie ended the entire audience showed a wonderful applause because as I mentioned it's a Masterpiece . Screw all the haters saying that this movie is too violent , I admit there might be some slightly terrifying scenes but there is nothing that terrifying to leave the movie . I'm 16 years of age and I have seen much more mental and violent movies than this . I wanna thank Tod Phillips for bringing this Masterpiece to life and I hope he'll keep making more amazing movies like this in the near future . Thank you Joaquin Phoenix for bringing the joker each and everyone desperately needed .1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
"Grey, gritty and nightmarish","Joaquin pheonix's JOKER is a gritty and nightmarish character study of Travis Bickle-esque ""Arthur fleck"" aka the JOKER who descends into madness for personally justifiable reasons.The film does draw inspirations from Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING of COMEDY but it's nothing like any of them. Its actually gives us a more deeper look at Travis bickle from TAXI DRIVER.Now, let's talk about the Joaquin Pheonix..of course I can't confine my admiration for him just to an IMDB review but anyway. Joaquin's performance is absolutely brilliant, menacing and terrorizing as the JOKER. He totally gives you the creeps. Having said this, although his portrayal of the character is brutally violent towards the finish, the intentional slow burn of the film gives you enough time to know him that you can't help but empathize with the character at least in some darkest corner of your mind.Who played it best: for this I'd say until Heath ledger terrified the world with his brilliant performance in the dark Knight we couldn't think of anybody else who could play it like jack nicholson and he undoubtedly superceded jack Nicholson's portrayal in the 1989 BATMAN.And now with JOKER Joaquin undoubtedly inherited the throne Heath left.👏👏👏👏👏
Only if he were alive Heath would have lauded Joaquin's performance.thats how it works in any art form. There can be no ABSOLUTES what so ever. Ever body contributes to the medium.So i'd say kudos to Jack, Heath and JOAQUIN FREAKING PHEONIXTodd Philips I thank you so much for giving us such a great movie about the character we all love.I so so wish Matt Reeves considers Joaquin to play the joker in his upcoming Batman film if at all he plans to have a Joker in the film.Make way for GOTHAM'S new Clown Prince of Crime."

i wasnt happy not for a minute in my hole life. genius,"A combination of three top movies taxi driver, king of comedy and the six senses. those who appreciate Avengers movies will be disappointed. if you are under the age of 30 you should not go because you will not understand it and will not like it because joker has no superpowers. an interesting scenario full of realism that I haven't seen for many years and I didn't think Americans would do. I bet he'll win the Oscar. the problem is that those who appreciate real dramas (say almost the movie is inspired by real facts) will not go to this movie thinking it's fantasy as batman. comparing the notes given on imdb by Americans and the smaller notes given by Romanians shows the degree of culture between us and them. when it is a superficial movie like Avengers full of cartoons we give bigger notes than them.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Masterpiece,"This movie is a pure depiction of how a masterpiece looks like. Joaquin Phoenix have nailed the character of Joker. He doesn't only act from his expressions but also from his body. When Joker kills everybody, somewhere inside you know that this is not morally correct, but when you think about the sorry state of affairs with Arther Fleck, you somehow sympathize with him. That's where this movie gets into your nerves. Every single frame of this movie is a masterpiece. It shook my mind so big that I'm talking about this movie since last 3 days. The climax will blow up your mind. This movie screams for a sequel out of itself. How the society these days are not well behaved. People with mental illness finds themselves so lonely because this society never accept them. Rather they abuse them, to their limits. That's where some kind of Joker like character comes out. This movie makes you believe that there is a possibility of a Joker in this society. The society which abandons a loner and treats him like a trash. A man who was never happy in his entire life. A man who finds himself in between a kind of identity crisis. Words are less to describe how good Joaquin Phoenix has portrayed the clown prince of crime. This is the epitome of cinematic art. BRILLIANT!"
Masterpiece,"Joker is absolutely truthfully a masterpiece. The acting, the screenplay, the tone, the character development, the music is just outstanding. At the end of the movie you realize there is something more in the movie and the joker's origin is still questionable. 10/10 Joaquin desevers the Oscar for the Best actor this year.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A must read review for a must view film,"I watched JOKER with superhero trepidation.As a stout Marvel fan and and having been somewhat let down by the promise that DC were going darker following Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (killings aside), I entered the theatre wondering what kind of picture Warner brothers would present.Some of the adverts prior to the movie were drolé and tried to replicate the suggested horror and intrigue that would be presented in the film, but the copycats fell short of the truth.
Joker presents a dark and intrepid insight into the origins of one of DC's most fabled villains.
The acting by Phoenix was sublime and the setting held true to the history of the character and the references to the origins of batman were there to be seen.I do not want to dwell much on the story of the film as it would detract and deter some from witnessing this visual extravaganza and performance, and to surmise Joaquin Phoenix gives his soul to this homage and becomes truly encapsulating.
To bring this into modern context, it is a man who suffers from mental illness who loses his right to help from the government due to budget cuts whilst the over pompous capitalists drink champagne, ride in limo's and sleep in mansions whilst profiting from the lesser man. Much of this is only hinted at however and bares little influence to the piece as The Joker is not a political figure until he emerges from his metamorphis, which only occurs following a dramatic event - and this itself only happens near the end of the film.Phoenix depicts a truly delirious, deep, and troubled character haunted by the events of his family life which have echoed into his present and in some ways dictate his behavior's such as his memorable, yet haunting, uncontrollable laugh - which is well characterized in the movie.
There are a lot of comments regarding mental impairments and how this movie should have been a higher classification - but having looked at the BBFC category wording it neither dwells on any particular situation nor glorifies it - however it is a deep portrayal of a troubled and well know (sic) super villain and in the film there are at least 2 somewhat contentious moments so watch at your own {peril}.This film in my view, has been released at the most appropriate time. The world is waking up to the fact that fat cats (which include movie stars) are milking the lesser man (sic) as the societal gaps widens between rich and poor and this real life occurrence is well represented in this film."
Some of the best acting I've ever seen. Wow.,"Phoenix completely nailed the role. His transition from Arthur to Joker was so well developed, and every move he made had me on the edge of my seat. So well done, I'm practically speechless.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
An astonishingly brilliant movie with a sledgehammer performance by Phoenix.,"Just saw this movie today in the cinema and my god what a hell of a film this is. Taking place in 1981, we are introduced to the origin of The Joker in all his dark, gritty, violent, psychotic glory. The transformation of Arthur Flecks character is ground breaking. we see this poor, misunderstood man mercilessly beaten multiple times before finally lashing out taking his first steps towards becoming this infamous villain we love so much getting deeper and progressively more intense and violent as the film goes on. There are a couple moments in this film that some might find hard to watch but it's seriously not as bad as what everyone's been saying about it. in saying that, this is definitely not a film for kids.Anyone who is familiar with the Batman films will know well and truly that Bruce Wayne's (Batman's) parents are murdered in front of him in an alley way when he's still only a young boy. This film shows this event and the events leading up to it. In terms of the overall timeline of events, Joker begins roughly 3 weeks before Bruce Wayne's parents are killed.Joker carries a very dark, stylish theme just like so many batman movies have done before it. the score, cinematography and the astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix are some of the biggest impacts a film has had on me over the last decade. We also have some strong political messages on display here too which I will not delve into here. Leave that for the forum sites =)Joker is one truly amazing film and is sure to go down as an all time masterpiece. 10 out of 10."
One man show from Joaquin Phoenix,It is an amazing movie done by Joaquin Phoenix. The antagonist of this movie (Joaquin Phoenix) deserves an Oscar award. Great work done by director Todd Phillips. Storyline was good and quite disturbing. Rest of the crew did a decent role. The plot revolves around the life of joker which has led him to be the sinister of Gotham City. Watched the movie in imax and had a great experience. I will recommend others to watch the movie. Loved the movie a lot.

Outstanding,"Perhaps one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Often The Joker is portrayed as a top class gangster/ring leader in the prime of his crime endeavours. However, I find this story visceral in its way of creating a monster whose only way is down, yet becomes a martyr against bureaucracy. Those who have the most ambition, but have no where to put it and no avenues to pursue, fall down a path of madness to achieve what they want. And this story told that madness perfectly. An outstanding film and one that will stay with me forever.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

A tragic masterpiece that will be talked about for many years to come!!!!!,"Where do I begin, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a man who is suffering from an uncontrollable mental affliction and occupies the lower echelons of society, through a series of events that lead him towards the path of becoming one of the most infamous villains in history: The Joker!!!!! All I have to say is this film is brilliant, disturbing, and of course tragic. Joaquin Phoenix brings an Oscar worthy performance throughout the whole movie as we follow his descent into madness. The soundtrack by Hildur Gudnadottir is a masterstroke, giving you this sense of sadness and horror as it plays throughout the film. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is absolutely stunning showcasing Arthur's world as ugly, fractured, yet strangely beautiful. And finally, the direction of Todd Phillips, along with his screenplay with Scott Silver, bring all of these elements together to portray a haunting tale of how a man with a fragile mindset can be turned into a monster by an unforgiving and corrupt society which won't be forgotten anytime soon.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
MASTERPIECE,"I was skeptical prior to watching due to all the hype. But wow - Phoenix really owns the character, adding his own spin to Joker as we know him. The boundaries are pushed more and more which was a precedent set by Heath Ledger in Dark knight, adding a deeper facet to the Joker and coupled by the back story, cinematic precision and a really good story, JOKER is everything DC'ers have longed for since the Christopher Nolan Trilogy. Legacy links to Wayne's, Bruce and the death of Thomas created a real connection to all the stories we have watched before. I just hope the next Batman movie supersedes this - and a Batman & Joker movie is a MUST.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Go see this movie with your own eyes. Do not trust the critics,"I was one of the few people who did not have much thought about the movie when I saw the first trailers. I did not expect it to be great or bad, I knew it was a Joker origin story, and that is about it. I had seen the Killing Joke animated movie and I immediately knew what I was getting into.
The movie was a perfect work of art that you can easily see fit in to the 1980s or with a few adjustments in the present or the Dark Knight trilogy as a spinoff.Joaquin Phoenix brings this character to life and you buy it so well because you understand what he experienced or why he goes down the dark path. He looks great as a either characters and you see the slow transformation.Finally the critics and the media are slamming this movie for being a celebration of evil. It's a lie and an intentional misdirection to get clicks on their videos or news sites. It is completely not. If this movie is a celebration of evil, then Deadpool is the month long celebration of violence and degradation because that movie kills people because it's fun and comedic. It is a disgrace how much the media and the critics bent backward to critic this movie just because it accurately portrays violent groups. So if you want to know why this movie is so drawn and quartered now in the US, it's because it sneaks in too much truth.So my recommendation is to go see it for yourselves. Games, movies and literature do not create monsters, people do."

A reflection on Mob Culture and Mental illness,"After watching it, the reason why the PC SJW ruling class of Hollywood hated it was crystal clear to me. The movie depicts an Antifa-like mob destroying the city, clashing with the police, totally resentful and picking on regular citizens. Anarchists, they have always been. They're not into justice or equality, they wanna wreck things as if life was nothing but a joke. Mob rules Gotham and Antifa rules Portland. Arthur Fleck is the cathalizer. I wonder, if the movie was about a deeply perturbed woman, who inspired havoc amongst citizens, would it be condemned as this movie has been or would have been held as empowering and brave?1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

The character build up was full of emotions of empathy and rage that will last with you after you leave the cinema hall!Joaquin Phoenix hit us hard with his phenomenal performance. He made us feel uncomfortable, miserable, angry and we showed empathy.
It was uneasy at all going through this all.And the master scene he gave us when he draw a smile on his face out of his blood was perfect👌.
I only wished to see more of the joker in the movie especially that Joaquin has the most similar features to the joker in the comic books and in our minds.Eventually this movie will leave you full of emotions of empathy and rage that will last with you after you leave the cinema hall!"
Makes a great character study and executes a brilliant film.,"Not only is this a great comic book movie, it's a great movie, by all standards. One that would come in the 70s , looking like it, acting like it, by the biggest hits of it's cinematic output. This is not a pleasant movie to sit through. It depicts a persons slip from sanity in a way that makes you go from fearing for him to those who oppose him. Not in a way the celebrates these vile acts he commits. It knows the tragedy of the character, and uses it to create a genuinely impactful character study and form a cationary tale around it.Though it was questioned rather comedy director Todd Phillips would be able to bring the chops needed for such a story. Such worries are moot, once the brutal grittyness, the nastyness the visaeral execution of these things play out. It's well as well, moving in a slow burn to bursts, akin to the characters own mind, before it snaps at the end.Carrying this all is Phaqin Penoix, who is meanicing, unnerving, yet with a dose of fun and sympathy. He's creepy to watch and owns every scene, carrying the whole film as it's star. A film that is deserving of praise , makes you think, creates uncomfortable questions, and executes it's intentions valiantly. This one is a keeper every film buff should see."
A perfect ode to Heath Ledger,"KNOCK KNOCK! Joker is one such exceptional film which gets the perfect balance of staying noir & elevating empathy for the protagonist.
The film delves with oppression, the oppressed from the first frame, and it becomes very evident, the journey of the protagonist will take a downward curve in the graph to bring out the change in the society, unfortunately resulting in anarchy.
The film never tries to pretend intelligent, and it plays well within the dramatics, not getting drifted away. There are some real beautiful scenes which brings out how oppressed the protagonist is and that too with his signature laugh, you feel for the character, you want to hoot for him to succeed, and you realise the actions by the protagonist to resolve the main conflict is not justified, and the filmmaker is careful not to glorify his actions rather smartly diverts us into the psyche of the protagonist as defense mechanism.
Joaquin Phoenix gives us a crackling performance, enacting the Joker himself, every scene- the laugh, the stare, the helplessness has been so consistent, that one would expect him to succeed for his dream of becoming a standup comedian and come out of this pity. This is a perfect ode to Heath Ledger, he would have been so happy to see this amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
Lastly, the film beautifully portrays the real Joker on screen yet again, where his jokes are as subjective as his actions.
This film gives an urge to watch Heath Ledger's version of Joker.
Highly Recommended! Don't miss it!"
I hated it but couldn't stop watching,I can't even explain this you literally just need to go watch. I absolutely hated how he was treated in his marginalisation by society and at one point (subway scene) I was crying because my heart hurt for him.

Exceeded my expectations. A brilliant movie. Probably the best in its genre.,"This movie was so colourful but dark at the same time. It looks absolutely beautiful. I believe DC has been trying to make their movies gritty, serious and dark. But it never worked with the way they attempted in the past few years. It was very diffrent from what DC has been trying for years, you know... they make the colours, the athmosphere all gross and stuff, the story is always the same with the big bad unstoppable godly villain.This was such a diffrent experience. Entertaining and effective. It had a really interesting and kinda confusing story too. It was hard to watch at times and some scenes actually made me uncomfortable. How they managed to write Joker is astounding. The isolation and the struggles he faces are told is exciting.This is the best movie I saw this year. It deserves the hype. I love this movie, it surprised me. I am proud of DC. I hope they write movies as good as this. Maybe even better ones, if possible. This might be the start of a new era for superhero movies. At least I hope it is."

Simply outstanding!,"I don't understand the negative reviews and Metacritic score. I think these critics need to come down from their pathetic self-centered high grounds and see the movie for what it is: an outstanding piece of art the likes of which are produced very rarely. This coming from a person who has seen thousands of movies from across timelines and across cultures. It should get at least 5 Oscar noms and win at least three. If Joaquin Phoenix does not get Best Actor Oscar then the Academy deserves a visit by Arthur Fleck!. Definitely among the 10 best ever from any country and any language.

The Clown Prince of Crime is born!,"Yesterday, I went to watch the Joker, and I have to say that the film was absolutely brilliant. It has genuinely put a positive smile on my face! Joaquin Phoenix's performance, the overall storyline, along with how the film was put together is completely worth watching.As the Joker is a standalone film from the current list of DC films, it was refreshing to see a bold, dark and gritty attempt to deeply witness Arthur transform into one of the world's most notorious comic book villain. I would like to go in depth about his transition, but it is something the viewers need to watch for themselves. For me, this is one of the reasons why I enjoyed this film - it is not just about the Joker being a psychopath, but it is about understanding Arthur's circumstances, as well as his perspective about life.In terms of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker, I really enjoyed his take on the character, and his version is currently my favourite. The insanity and brutal stance (attitude) of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is just mind-blowing, and this film gives us an opportunity to see an untamed and extreme Joker in a live action film.This film does contain some shocking, violent, along with gruesome scenes, and this is to be expected with a character like the Joker. He is not the clown you invite to your child's birthday party for an amusing experience. Looking back at the film, certain scenes were not even that horrific, and critics and individuals are unnecessarily attacking this film. There are other films and TV shows that are much more aggressive than the Joker.If you are yet to watch the film, go and see it without overthinking it. The hype that was within the trailers, expands throughout the film. It is that good. The Joker is a one of a kind film, and Todd Phillips has shown us what is possible for mature, in depth and dark comic book films."

Best Movie of The Year,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Cinematography. Acting. Directing. Music. Tone. Pace. Suspense. Everything about this film is BEAUTIFUL. I don't care if this inspires world violence or not, it is a masterpiece. This Is art. This is going to be one of my all time favourite psychological thriller movies. I don't believe the controversy. It won't inspire mass murder or terrorists. It is fiction. It is a realistic drama and character study about what creates an unstable man. I'm not a super fan of the Joker, but I must say, DC better keep doing movies like this.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Beautifully Depressing,"Joker was beautifully depressing like a Street Car Named Desire. It was by no means a Super hero film which I loved about it. Rather than formulaic dog shit, it actually did something different, dirty, grimy and succeeded in being hopelessly dark, captivating and Phoenix was brilliant. This is definitely the darkest Joker you will ever see and reminds me of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, The Tenant and Requiem for a Dream mixed with a Scorcesse/Tarantino Pizazz.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Polish the Oscars,"People are walking out because this movie hits home. As realistic as it can get! Everyone did an amazing job getting this film done.

Masterpiece,As a viewer and a fan of Joker this was a amazing movie. Joaquin carries this movie. What a performance from him. Simply outstanding. I thought no one could pull off a Joker after Heath Ledger in Dark Knight but I am happy to be proven wrong. This is a must watch. Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his performance. And please ignore the stupid controversy created by pathetic media.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink

Heath ledgers fans CALM DOWN!!!,"Very strong build up character with great storytelling. I enjoyed every moment in the movie, from the begining until the end without forgetten the class performance by Joaquin Phoenix.It would be unfair to say Heath performed better neither Phoenix, both portrayals were great.I will sum my review with one word ""Iconic""1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Great movie!,"From the beginning to the end of this movie, it was so well explained how he became who is now, the joker! There were parts that had me and my daughter surprised, like the Bruce Wayne part and his mother. I didn't expect the movie to be the way that it was, and I'm so glad we went to go see it. It was such a good movie and it kind of reminded me of the actor who played the joker in Dark Knight.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Joaquin Phoenix Delivers,"Joker is a masterful look into the mind of a psychopath. The tension was palpable in the theatre, people cowered and screamed at every display of the Joker's unparalleled insanity. Joker is a compelling look into treading the line between psychotic and normal, chaotic and peaceful, evil or disturbed. Joaquin Phoenix was truly better than perfection in this role.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Amazing Movie,"I'm no longer a huge fan of many super hero movies. And it seems like DC has not really been able to find a formula like Marvel has in order to produce good ones. They often picked gritty movies for the wrong superhero. However, this movie is one of the greatest super hero movies of all time.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Best cinematic achievement of the decade,"This Joker was a masterpiece. The way Todd Phillips unfolds the tragic story of Arthur Fleck is a piece of cinema that can only be explained by emotion. The essence in which the Joker as a character is warped and distorted to be the award winning, no doubt, performance of Joaquin Pheonix is truly exceptional and outstanding. From the mis en scene to the minor green tint throughout the whole movie, each frame is to be cherished by the audience. Todd Philips should be internationally recognised and applauded for his story telling in Joker. If you emphasise for a villain who has caused a whole city to riot and to murder, either you are sick, or Philips' creation has been successful. Heath ledger isn't comparable to how amazing and twisted this performance was. If I was to recommend any movie, it'd be 2019s shock film Joker. Physiologically thrilling and heart throbbingly emotional at the same time, this movie has made 5 stars in my opinion. Congratulations Warner Brothers.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A mastered work of art,The Joker was beautifully brilliant! Amazing cinematography. Exceptional storytelling. Impeccable acting. The action of this film was unexpected. For once I could not anticipate the next move. It's sheer genius and creativity. In a world where we are moving at such a vivacious pace it took me down a slow journey into the darkness trauma can bring. And it was a sweet twist on the the Batman origin story! If you love the artistry of filmmaking than it is a must see.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
Unbelievable,"Never in a million years would I have expected Todd Phillips to make a movie of this caliber. It falls into what I'd like to believe is a sub genre of comic book films, like Logan and Brightburn, where the world of superheros is more dark and intense than the action/comedy cookie cutter big budget films (don't get me wrong, I love them also) we get during the summer season. Joker is incredible.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Legendary performance by Joaquin Phoenix,A true piece of art. I had the privilege to watch this movie today. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Joker. We all have seen Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. I thought Heath Ledger's performance was twisted. Joaquin Phoenix performance is even more twisted. If he doesn't get an Oscar then I'll stop watching movies. He has put his heart and soul in this performance. Don't believe critics words. This movie has to be watched in a movie hall. At the end I was actually in tears. It would be sad if someone else is given Oscar instead of Joaquin Phoenix. This has to be the best origin story ever told. I don't have words to describe this movie. Still reeling under the effect of this movie. Request all to watch this movie. This is Joaquin Phoenix's best word till date.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink
Masterpiece,"This movie is masterpiece. The acting, the music, the environment everything is masterpiece. I got out of theatre, went home slept a bit and even after 12 hours,my head still remembers the vivid details of the movie. It leaves a lasting impact. Though the movie is great. I gotta say. This movie is a single shot, it wouldnt be continued to dc universe. Lastly if you have not watched this movie you are missing a piece of art that would be remembered for ages1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Incredible🃏,"This film was incredible I love the tie ins to taxi driver,king of comedy and the killing joke. Joker has been surrounded by controversy some saying about its violence and it being sinister it that is a load of crap and it should not make you reconsider seeing the film. Joaquin Phoenix knocks it of the park with his performance possibly Oscar worthy. If you are expecting a classic superhero film it's not what you will expect this film gets you thinking it's very psychological. This film was so good in some ways I do wish it was an 18 but the joker is an incredible film it's proud of what it is and it is the best superhero film of the year1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Epic!!,"The critics are so very wrong. This film is stunning from start to finish. Everything is on point, the style, cinematograghy, acting, music score are all phenomenal. I really enjoyed viewing the film from the perspective of Arthur, his journey was our journey. His unreliable narration was really engaging and I felt constantly on edge.Perhaps this film glorifies violence in the way that every action film does. This is a film about the Joker, there's going to be violence and depictions of mental health, which in my opinion were grounded in realism. I don't see people complaining about John Wick, The bourne identity, James Bond, the godfather, pulp fiction, goodfellas, American Psycho, kill bill, django unchained etc etc. I get the point but I dont see how its any different in this movie than the rest.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
Masterpiece,"I was concerned about the hype and rarely put a review on IMDB. But this time I was just astonished by the performance of the Joker. You can feel the stress, anxiety madness, sadness, basically all the emotions played by an actor at the best level. Even his body seems having pain and sadness for the entire movie. Disturbing and amazing at the same time. Just a Masterpiece.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
A masterpiece,"I never write reviews about movies, even though I have seen movies where my mind is blown but Joker... it's not just an origin story but a cinematic masterpiece where the storyline, costume design, sound and even the colors were very well executed. Joaquin's acting is definitely Oscar worthy, his performance is what will get him out of the ""underrated"" category. He portrays the essence of Joker and to see how the character came to be was simply marvelous and surprisingly satisfying. Would watch it more than once and I'm not one of those people. 100% recommended.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"
DC has taken the right step and comes up with a clear storyline at last,"So far, the best film I have seen DC has made. So much has been conveyed, within such a little time. Getting a storyline has always been hard for DC, the mixed timelines and the inconsistent story and bouncing between characters has always been a downer. The one character that has always made DC a success was Joker. And this film has lived up to it's name.
The screenplay is one of the best in the recent times. Joaquin phoenix has lived as the Joker entirely. The transformation of Arthur Flex to The Joker, the penultimate movie of the entire DC cinematic universe. It's a must watch for everyone who wishes to side with the Joker.
I would give everything I have up in a heart beat just to see another movie Joker movie made.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

Spoiler Free review,"Heath Ledger will probably always be my favorite rendition of The Joker, because of the charisma and intelligence he brought to the role.
With that said, I don't think anyone could have played this version of the Joker except for Joaquin Phoenix. He did things with the character, both through physicality of acting and through emotional depths, that both amazed and hurt me.
The movie is most definitely a drama and something of a personal journey of horror. It does not, as was my fear and the voiced concerns of many others, demonize everyone with a mental illness, or give justification for the incels and Red Pill Society members and MRA's to be terrible human beings. Neither does it say ""Hey if you're alone and nobody likes you you can fix your problems with a little random violence."" Instead, it shows us a plethora of factors, and a variety of nudges, that cause someone who's already struggling with who they are in life, and whether or not they actually even exist, to take a dark path. Joker shows us that those with mental illnesses, the 'clowns', the people considered broken or invisible or worthless by society as a whole, are being consistently let down by the system, at every turn. And Phoenix, and the writers, do an incredible job of showing us that The Joker is *human*. He's not some criminal mastermind, not at this point; he's very much figuring things out as he goes, and the film takes care to point out several times that the Joker is not making a political statement with his actions; he's not trying to enact sweeping change, or smash the Patriarchy, or fight The Man; he's just done with everyone's shit, and with how he feels the world is treating him. The movie doesn't have a lot of violence, but when it does it is brutal, harsh and quick; and it explores the ripple effects those violent acts cause.I found this to be an incredible film. I didn't come away from it feeling like it blamed those with mental issues or trauma; The Joker was very much responsible for his own actions, just as we all are. But it definitely helped remind me that underneath the makeup, there was still a human being in there, and it definitely made me analyze my feelings on the interactions between Batman and the Joker over the years.If you see this movie, expect to cry (I teared up several times) and to feel awkward; they do an excellent job of overextending an awkward situation until it becomes almost unbearable. Also, they somehow manage to be predictable without being boring; the predictability instead turns into a slow build of dread, because you can see where something is going a mile off, and then you're still along for the unavoidable end. And this movie is an R for a lot of language, and some fairly brutal violence.
It is not a movie that leaves you feeling good at the end, but it is one I am glad I went to see, and I hope that they tap Phoenix for the Joker in a future movie; he can clearly find that character's depths."
Really trully masterpiece,"All that i can say is
Wow how amazing trully really i wonder joker will be trully movie of all time in my personal opinion,

"Not just a great comic book movie, a great movie period!","After Jared Leto's letdown performance as the character in 2016's Suicide Squad, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance of The Joker since the late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight!This film is a self contained story that doesn't draw heavily off of any one comic book story, though there are little nods to the comics, such as The Wayne Family/a young Bruce Wayne playing a prominent role in the movie, plus subtle nods to The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns.It's in a dark, gritty world that the film takes place, as we are taken back to 1981 and we're transported to a Gotham City unlike any we've seen before on film, a city not unlike our real world. It's a Gotham City on the edge of chaos, and Phoenix's Arthur Fleck/Joker is the catalyst that throws the switch, as the people of Gotham begin to riot against the elite and upper class of the city and regard The Joker as a folk hero and Robin Hood type of figure. The film has major echoes of past 80s films, such as Taxi Driver and Dog Day Afternoon.It's within this gritty realism that the stakes of the movie takes place. Phoenix's portrayal of this mentally unstable man, whom society has turned it's back on, is both frightening and relatable. As his mental faculties begin to unravel, the viewer can't help but sympathize in some way with The Joker's plight. He's pained by what he's suffered in life, but he goes off the deep end into a life of crime. That's what makes Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the character so frightening. More than any other incarnation of the character, this one has echoes of our real world: that nothing is more frightening than a mentally unstable person with a gun.But it also leaves The Joker's backstory up in the air and up for debate by the end of the film, as Arthur/Joker is an unreliable narrator, and the audience is left wondering what exactly in the film's narrative was the truth and what were just delusions in The Joker's head.It's a film that transcends genres. It's not just a great comic book based film, it's a gritty, dark, and brilliantly done character study. It's a movie with real world consequences, as the characters are very reflective of the criminals that plague the news every day.An absolutely stunning performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the movie definitely is worth every amount of acclaim it's getting! Phoenix deserves an Oscar! It's a brilliant piece of film!!"
Best movie of the 21st century,"From the moment the movie started, it was dark and it got darker which each segment. Over the years we have gotten full fledged jokers never an origin where we actually get to see why he became joker. I'm really glad mr phillips took up the mantle in doing this film because we really needed a change from the campy, over the top, predictable, cheesy and kid friendly cbm's we've been getting esp. from marvel. You do have people out there who are interested in serious contents that challenges one's belief. This movie isn't glorifying killing or incels it shows you how society can help shape disenfranchise individuals. The fact that critics are outraged over this, has led me to be believe the director has achieved his motive(by creating a thought provoking film). The critics are proving todd's and joker's point about society. This is top tier movie and DEFINITELY one of the best movies ever made esp. in the 21st century. The best movie of the year.....It's right up there with Dark Knight if not better.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"

That's exactly why I fell in love with Hollywood,"A very deep psychological dig into the society's most destructive tool which is the society itself. Gotham, the perfect atmosphere to transform a citizen into the Joker. The movie is about this journey of transformation psychologically and socially. It also digs into the heart and soul of the idea of anarchy.
Epic performance from Joaquin Phoenix, an Oscars worthy.
