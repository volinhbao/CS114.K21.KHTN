Joker,"As a viewer that actually went to TIFF and witnessed this film and didn't want to believe the hype, it is an absolute MASTERPIECE and Phoenix is a certified legend.","I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.",0
Joker,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.3,602 out of 4,398 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Only certain people can relate,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.3,073 out of 3,863 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Perfect in every aspect.,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.3,318 out of 4,205 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,MASTERPIECE üòç,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime2,876 out of 3,670 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,The Hype is real,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.2,458 out of 3,138 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director2,094 out of 2,746 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Went for a second time to watch,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.1,965 out of 2,620 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",0
Joker,"Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight.","It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.1,758 out of 2,415 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"Finally, a REAL movie","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.929 out of 1,372 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Joker > Endgame,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.1,417 out of 2,133 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Critics are useless!,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!",0
Joker,BELIEVE THE HYPE,"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.618 out of 1,018 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Masterpiece.,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society.

& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.

Joker,Brilliant. And best joker I've ever seen,"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.442 out of 776 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Movie of the Decade,"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human.

Joker,CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away
1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.",0
Joker,The Rise of the Joker!,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10",0

Joker,Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinema,"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.",0
Joker,Astonishing Masterpiece,"What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.280 out of 531 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+",0

I am infinitely grateful that he has taken the time to investigate about the disorders, about the drugs, but above all for the time that he has dedicated to perfecting such an important detail as the Joker's laugh, a laugh that is so impactful and full of pain, frustration, anger and in many cases madness.

I don't like comics movie, marvel is very pompous, absurd and insipid. In my opinion. It's not an art, it's just an attraction. As DC movies was too. But now DC made history, the made art and made drama.
To be more understandable. When you watch for example Avengers or League of Justice you are eating McDonald's hamburger.

Joker,Film of the year (if not of the decade),"I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get.",0

Joker,Masterpiece *Movie Of the Year* Best Actor - Joaquin Phoenix*,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!",0

Joker,A Huge Leap In The Right Direction For DC Films,"This is a dark, twisted, sad and sympathetic take of possibly the most enduring comic book villain of all time. DC would be wise to keep taking risks like this and blurring the genre lines because this is where they have a change to excel in an area the MCU won't cross into for fear of not being family friendly. If you cannot match Marvel in an interconnected universe then the answer lies squarely in making quality solo, if not one-off films like this. Phoenix is one of the top actors of his generation and I think it is possible to judge this take on Joker without even comparing to Ledger's. Both are genius and both very different. I have to go off topic and say the one person I'd love to have seen play a live action version was Mark Hamill at the right point in time but we'll have to just give him the best maniacal Joker laugh award and be content with that.6 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.","Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.139 out of 299 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Spare me the ""best comic book movie ever"" nonsense.","It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.106 out of 227 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,One of THE BEST PERFORMANCE ever!,"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.
It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.
Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.99 out of 211 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Disturbingly brilliant film making,"Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves.",0

Joker,"Led by a stunning Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is an instant classic","Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5",0

Joker,Chilling and deep,"Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10",0
Joker,DC's masterpiece. Although a huge risk for the studio -- it paid of. A lot.,"I had the chance of seeing a screening of Joker at the Venice Film Festival last week. 'Joker' was easily one of the highlights of the festival thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing.Although the movie consists of an amazing supporting cast, you mostly watch the movie through Arthur's (Joker's) lenses. Arthur is present in every scene of the movie, ala taxi drive. The movie clearly draws inspiration from Scorsese's 80s work (most notably from Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy. There's a lot of nods and easter eggs for the fans of those two movies). The gotham city we see in this movie is the most corrupt version to date, which is to be expected when our beloved caped crusader doesn't exist. It's a nightmarish vision of New York where corruption, crime and chaos are the leading forces behind everything. The story takes clever twists and turns that will leave even the most hardcore and well-read DC fans with their jaws on the floor. I wish I could talk about them but I don't want to go into spoilers. As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the clown prince of crime, there's really not much to say that you haven't read already. Phoenix literally transforms into both the role of Arthur Fleck and the Joker, giving us a super realistic and groundbreaking performance that even the Oscars cant snob. Joker is a strong contender for best picture.This movie is a must watch for both comic book and drama fans alike. It's a deep character study of a mentally ill man slowly sinking into madness that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 from me. I cant wait to see more small budget comic book movies about other DC villains (or heroes!).",0

Joker,All It Takes Is One Bad Day!,"Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors.",0

Joker,That's Life,"Joker is a contemporary example of a chef-d'oeuvre. It's a monumental piece of art. In essence, it's a masterpiece. Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix in a once in a lifetime portrayal of an iconic comic book villain. Barring any connection to the source material, Joker stands on its own as a film that will be upheld in the annals of the decade's best films.Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a mentally unstable man who is trying to find his place in a society that rejects him. Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur is perfection. Phoenix captures the essence of life with mental illness. In a career with so many masterful character portrayals, this is the one that viewers will cite as Phoenix's crown jewel. The emotion within the film supersedes great acting by taking a step into reality. Arthur Fleck is a character that is written so well and so real that it hurts. Where much of the media stigmatizes mental illness, the character of Arthur Fleck humanizes it.The cinematography in this movie is incredible. 2019 has been a year of great camera work, and this film spearheads the year. There are many iconic scenes layered throughout the film that are phenomenally shot. As the movie progresses, the film grows exceptionally in terms of cinematography. At times it is hard to tell whether the movie was shot digitally or on film. Essentially, this movie bridges the gaps between new wave cinema and contemporary cinema in a graceful manner. The lighting used within the film is atmospheric and successfully matches Arthur's mood throughout the film. The cinematography is masterful.This film is a Dramatic, Psychological Thriller with a great twist. The writing is insanely clever. The suspense is uncanny. The ending is satisfying and chilling. The supporting cast are great. They add weight to Arthur's emotion, successfully building him up and progressing his development. The soundtrack is iconic. The music enhances the overall experience as opposed to watering it down with noise. This film is damn near perfection. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix created a modern masterpieceOverall, Joker is a classic in the making. It challenges the stigma surrounding mental illness, presenting a narrative coupled with classism. This movie is important. In a zeitgeist where mental instability is a common issue, this film gives voice to the voiceless.",0
Joker,No joke - it's brilliant,"I'll leave all the glossy remarks to the paid critics.I simply want to say that seldom have I been so riveted by a performance as I was last night.I'm primarily a comic Fan, long term too. Most adaptions are less than rubbish. This is excellent. Phoenix is Oscar worthy and the production is terrific.Being set in the past removes the over abundance of tech and gadgets which suits the character and the myth. It also allows the actors and the words to shine.The photography, the music (wow) and the supporting cast was flawless.So pleased it's still possible to make a movie like this.",0
Joker,Flawless Storytelling,"Casting was really good. No crazy surprise breakaway performances - everybody fit their parts and held their own (which is hard in the face of Phoenix and DeNiro).But the way the story unfolds, the foreshadowing, the grand revelations - absolutely masterful! Nobody would ever expect such good writing to be invested in a comic book villain origin story, but alas...25 out of 51 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"Uncomfortable, affecting, triumphant, dark","This movie will affect you. It speaks to society, it speaks to the human condition, it speaks to our darker instincts.

Joker,"Uncomfortable,Disturbing,Genius!","I haven't sat through the entire credits in stunned silence since ''let the right one in"" baring no resemblance to this movie whatsoever I was left completely speechless as to what I'd just witnessed. The term masterpiece is thrown around alot these days but Jaquin's nailed on performance of one of society's forgotton tormented souls that inevitabley arcs into the fragile but brutal criminal psychopath we know as the joker is understatedley 'perfect' to a level where the viewer is left to almost encourage Aurthur's inevitable wrong doings and sucker you into morally second guessing yourself with 'is he actually doing wrong?'
I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well.

Joker,The Perfect Storm portrayal of American society,"A country that makes mental health care treatment unaffordable to the poor (great surprise many of them are...), and blames poor people for being unsuccessful, thereby pushing them to the edges of society. Add to that the second amendment and handing out assault riffles to anyone, and there you have it The Perfect Storm.The most symbolic scene in my opinion is when the Joker puts a gun to his head and we see his face painted in red white and blue...An important movie, that will hopefully emphasize the problem, paving a way for a solution.24 out of 49 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Everything in the film has a greater, more universal meaning, and it's not rocket science to figure out what stands for what.

Joker,Rare occasion when the hype/buzz/comparisons are correct - Fantastic!,"I personally loved the film but, let's be honest, you don't care what I think.
Why would you... you don't even know me.No, YOU want to know if YOU'LL like the film and are looking for signs (occasionally hidden deep inside an ocean of egocentric opinions) as to whether or not you will.The answers simple.If you want, or are expecting, ANY semblance of a ""comic book"" movie there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It's not. And it doesn't attempt to be.The common comparison of ""If you like Taxi Driver, you'll love this"" is over-simplified yet astoundingly accurate.
It's true. If you're a fan of Taxi Driver, or similar films, you'll be right at home laughing (when you shouldn't be) along with Joker.The acting's outstanding across the board. Cinematography is absolutely fantastic. Everything from set design to editing add to the fact we now have another (rare) classic-in-the-waiting film that happens to draw from a comic book series.",0

Joker,"Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period.","Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.
Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed ""Fear City.""This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself ""God's lonely man"" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.
The Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",0

Joker,One of the most fascinating and engrossing films ever made,"Joker is absolutely brilliant. It's gritty and utterly captivating. It's a tough watch at times and yet you can't look away. I would not recommend it for the faint of heart, but if you love crime drama, 1970s movies, or very early Scorsese films you might enjoy Joker. The film is getting a tough rap from the mainstream critics, mainly because it's very divisive, but also because it shines a harsh light on some very rough subjects, including class warfare, access to health care, and the mental health crisis in America. If any of these things make you uncomfortable don't go see this film. As for my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and so does the director. Yeah, it's that good.One last thing, the photography demands that you see it in the best possible quality. Also, for goodness sake, don't let your kids see this movie. This is not a Batman film. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. It's a ""hard R"" crime drama.17 out of 33 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Will Hopefully Be Talked About for a Long Time,"This masterpiece of a film shows how, one sort of small Director and one of the best actors of all time can come together to make a movie that reflects society in the past but also today in some of the worst ways possible.
With the director, Todd Phillips, that did movies like the Hangover and Old School he shows that not only can he make very funny comedies but also a dark and serious period film. He's camera work throughout the entire film with over the shoulder shots and tracking shots of characters show how much he cared about the style and the feel of the 1980's Gotham setting.
The stand out of the entire film was Joaquin Phoenix's performance of the titular character of The Joker, but it doesn't feel like he is playing a Joker that we have ever scene before. We know the look of him and we know what his name is but his back story and many unique aspects to the character such as his laugh, and his voice are very different. Joaquin Phoenix seems to know that he is playing Arthur Fleck more than he is playing The Joker. By losing 50 lbs and learning dance moves and practicing the laugh of people with Pathological Laughter shows how much he cared about this role and the challenge it took for him to become The Joker and Arthur Fleck.
This movie as a whole is a period film and a character study. It shows how society is today with corruption and looking out the little guy. It shows how people can be treated so poorly and not cared about. It shows the dangers of what can come when things are slowly taken away from a person in their life. It also shows how mental illness can affect a person and their outlook on life. One quote is ""what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?"". This perfectly sums up how society can warp the mind of someone especially someone with a mental illness.
This movie deserves all the praise it's getting and will hopefully be talked about for years to come.",0

Joker,I created an account just to rate and comment on this movie. I am not a batman movies fan.,"I'm not usually a fan of comic based movies. I was never a fan of batman because I'm having a hard time taking people in costumes seriously. I went to watch joker because all of the hype and I was genuinely expecting it to be a so-so performance. I went there watching the Heath Ledger's joker before, which was OK in my opinion, as I said, I'm not a batman movies fan.
However.
This movie is not about batman, is not about comics, is not about superheros. This is a drama film. A drama which touches you deep inside on a special level, a movie which you feel because at least once you will sympathize with the joker. You will find yourself debating inside, whether he should be excused for his actions. Seeing Phoenix portray Arthur, from a beaten man, to become THE joker, quite by accident, is an extraordinary journey. The movie deserves all the praise it gets, and some.

Joker,Best in Venice. Best CBM of all time? Perhaps.,"Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film, delivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it. Phillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie film rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a love for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised. He navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay homage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves through each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits even roll.Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we actively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and strategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and most memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that you can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at times he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur Fleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers that will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise, while the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC characters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.So where does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark Knight.",0

Director Todd Phillips also proves once and for all that he too has a wide range of talent as a director and can take his films to the next level.Astonishingly beautiful score writtenCompletly grasping and thrilling plotThought provoking message about mental health and the underprivileged in this country.10/10 Would Highly Reccomend",0

Joker,Unreal Performance...,If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this it will only be because Hollywood is too sensitive. Probably best portrayal of the Joker yet...even though I still love Heath Ledger's version. This is just on another level! Would only warn against seeing this if you can't handle disturbing images/violence/dialogue.

Joker,The rundown on why people may or may not like the movie,"I loved the movie and believe it is one of my personal favorites ever, but many people are giving it bad reviews. This movie will please those who understand it and see the underlying messages, which makes it powerful, moving, entertaining, and real. But if you don't see the true meaning (or don't want to), it just seems like an unnecessarily dark and violent addition to the Batman ""franshise"". Another reason some people may dislike this movie and find it ""boring and too slow"" is because there is an extraordinary lack of CGI, which for me personally makes it all the better... and then some. If this sounds like a negative to you, please stick to The Avengers and don't waste your time, because you will. It's not cookie cutter, it's not a money grab, it's a movie that makes you think and can be perceived in many ways. Exceptional writing and a surreal acting performance turns this would-be great movie into something truly special.
There isn't a right way for Joker to be perceived, there is just a wrong way, and that's where the bad reviews come from, expecting something it was never meant to be, while missing/overlooking the greatness of this film.",0

Joker,One of the hardest things is living to the hype. It's even better.,"Little to say. I expected a masterpiece of a movie only based on comic books, and concentrated only in a character study for the ages.It is.Perfect story. Twists. Real drama. Real pain. Darkly funny at times, but not comedic in the least. It is violent, as it should, but never glorifying violence like the rest of the comic book adaptations (even the ones I love like Man of Steel or Infinity War or...)It is just perfect. I give my ""Thanks"" to all the people involved (I gave my money too, which is more important to them).----------- As a negative, It's not particularly original, with too many things (a few times, scenes) from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.
It is clearly better than those movies though",0
Joker,"If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this, We confirm that the whole industry is fake!","This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget!

Joker,Modern masterpiece - has got right under my skin!,"I would consider myself an avid film fan and in my 37 years, I have been privileged to watch many classic films that have an x-factor and capture the zeitgeist at the time. Some films are just beautifully put together and the combination of image and sound work together to create something more than its parts.Joker has the x-factor and works almost perfectly as a film. Seeing as perfect doesn't exist, this is as good as it gets. Throw in a performance on a Daniel Day-Lewis level and you have something very special. It clearly draws from Scorsese's work in the 1970s (Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy etc) but also has a very relevant social commentary about mental illness, the rich/poor divide and shared responsibility.The critical backlash after the initial praise is strange, but feels like a concerted effort to distance themselves from a film that could be too hot to handle. However, the people clearly disagree and the universal praise is totally deserving.This is a transportative and transformative film that looks backwards to redefine a genre and create a gem of a film. It's dark, depressing and glorious all at the same time.",0
Joker,No wonder critics are afraid of it.,"See. Its been such a long time since there has been a movie which is not supposed to make you feel happy or just give you moments. I am so happy that I got to witness this and see it. It will hit your soul. It will make you ask questions. It will make you think so hard, which is something we don't get in movies anymore.
Also, even though this is called ""Joker"", I hope people don't forget about Arthur, because I think that's what's important. The journey of Arthur to whatever he becomes.

Joker,"A classy character study on rise of the Clown Prince, Joaquin Phoenix & Todd Philips both deserve to be applauded","This is a brilliant film helmed by Todd Philips with an Oscar worthy turn by Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. This movie is more ""class"" than ""mass"". This is a very unique take on the character, very different from the Dark Knight's Joker that was played so awesomely by The late Heath Ledger. The film stays with you long after the end credits roll. I would like to add that it would be unfair & unnecessary to compare Joaquin's Joker with Ledger's Joker, since the same character is written differently in both films, and both these brilliant actors succeed in leaving their own unique impression on the viewer. And yes, the violence in this film has been totally overhyped some of the media outlets, the film is more a character study/drama with only a few scenes of violence that have been placed in sync with the story. Those expecting an ""action"" film, are likely to be disappointed.
Though this movie was planned as a standalone, I hope the success of this film inspires a Sequel.

Joker,Put on a happy face!!,"To appreciate ""Joker"" I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is (which usually comes from having gone through something traumatic, unfortunately). An example of dangerous compassion would be to, say, make a film made about the fragility of the human psyche, and make it so raw, so brutal, so balletic that by the time you leave the theatre you not only don't want to hurt anything but you desperately want an answer and a solution to the violence and mental health issues that have spun out of control around us.

Joker,Ultimate tale of morality,"It's been reported that some people found the level of violence so graphic they have walked out of the showing..I can understand why.

If, like me, you want a psychonautical joyride into the creation of the character of Joker.. open yourself to the lesson you're about to receive.Joaquin's portrayal is by far the superior version and most credible I have watched to date and his is a performance, I feel, cannot be surpassed, and should not, as here is the ultimate lesson of the nature of humanity - a poignant tale of human kindness and the consequences when that chain fails.. there are always repercussions for that imbalance and in the Joker, we see the deepest, darkest, most tragic and twisted sequence of consequences that should be a wake up call for us all, particularly now with the social injustices that are now common place. A Joker is reflected in each dispossessed person and we are many.A genuine masterclass in acting by Phoenix. The collaboration between Todd Phillips and Scott Silver is sheer brilliance.",0

His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema.

Joker,"A true ""kino"" experience; the most revolutionary and subversive film since Fight Club","Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers).",0

The whole film comes together brilliantly in a character study that is so believable and gritty that I held my breath the whole way through.I know this review is coming across as gushing, but honestly I cannot imagine how the character could have been portrayed any better. It might be my favourite Batman movie to date, and the Batman is not even in it!

Joker,"Ignore the critics, this is the movie of the decade!","I can see many scenes of this movie becoming iconic.The scene on the stairs and the fabulous but creepy dance Joker makes as a way to release anxiety. I can see it become famous just like the Rocky Balboa jump or the ""I am the King of the World"" standing with the open arms from Titanic.I haven't seen a movie this good in ages; It is funny, it is creepy, its has suspense, it has violence, action. It is intense. It shows mental illness in a way very few movies have done it in the past.It has smart jokes and if you ever felt depressed or lonely in your life (which most people have), you will understand it much better.The movie has 2 hours but it feels like 20 minutes providing such intensity and hanging on the edge of the seat story lineJoaquin deserves an Oscar, so does the movie not only because its great but to encourage director and movies companies to invest in more movies like this.Don't listen to the ""critics"" about this movie, the people are loving it and the voice of the people is the voice of God. Critics they go in the opposite direction of the flow because they see themselves as being ""different"" and they want to be different by saying something else than what everybody says in a bid to make them look like they ""know"" more than everyone else. If everybody loves a movie, they will hate it. And if everybody hates a movie, they will love it. Its always the same thing.Everyone can be a critic nowadays, thanks to the internet. So don't listen to them anymore, its just an outdated way of reviewing movies and not one bit reliable anymore.Go watch Joker and jump to your own conclusions, I bet you won't regret watching it.",0
Joker,BRILLIANT!!!! BRILLIANT!!!! BRILLIANT!!!!,"We watched Joker tonight, and I expected good acting from Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't sure about the story and everything else but I was willing to see how it will go. What I didn't expect was that I wouldn't blink an eye throughout the movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just give us good performance, but made Joker so real. Like he is one of us, and as my friend said - scary part was that you could relate to him and be on the same track with his thoughts. Everything is perfect in this movie - story, acting, photography, music... hell even the colors of this world are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix carried the whole storry on his back - it was an one man show that took all your attention, imagination, stirred all your feelings and emotions and left you speechless when The End letters came on the screen. The best movie this year for sure - Phoenix deserves Oscar for this one and any other reward he can get in this world.

Joker,In line with Heith Ledger,"Ok, nobody can beat Heith Ledger.. But Joaquin Phoenix does the Joker extremely well. I've been waiting for a movie, dark and serious as the Dark knight. I've been longing for a movie that isn't like all the marvel comedies, a movie that feels real.The Joker is effectively shot, the story is perfect and the acting is genius.What I like most is that the Joker is still a mystery, Todd Phillips did not destroy the character. He developed him.The movie is obscure but still so clear, this is one of the best movies made.The fact that people are worried about mass shootings just strengthen the fact that the movie is exceptionally well made. (of course it does NOT promote violence, it just shows how dark violence in fact is, unlike for example Deadpool.)
If I wasn't clear enough, see the movie, yesterday.",0
Joker,Joker is a representation of modern societies troubles,"The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!15 out of 29 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Shockingly bad... in a good way. A very good way!,"This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after.15 out of 29 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Do you want to hear a joke?,"Growing up I've seen all the iterations of the Joker character. From small screen to big screen. All of them are unique in their own way. Don't compare Phoenix to Ledger as the two Jokers are simply two different interpretations of the same concept. This is the story of the Joker from the inside out. There are no punchlines, no gimmicks and no silver lining. There is no hero in this film. This is a study on the concept of the Joker and how he became who he is. This movie is dark, terrifying, introspective and raw. Phoenix simply disappears in his role and you never wonder where he went. Everyone knows that the Joker is insane but never have we ever seen inside his mind like we do here. From top to bottom this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Phoenix has already won the best actor Oscar. It's just a matter of time before they hand it to him.15 out of 29 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Joker begins,"This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse.
To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing.
Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line.
Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years.
Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question.
this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life.
This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line?
Where do you put a stop to it?
How could you have prevented this from happening?
The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him.
Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man.
The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie.
He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar.
Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another.
We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people.
No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us.
We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged.
It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts.
Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them.
This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here.
Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix.
This man is a wonder.
I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career.
You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her.
He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in.
From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie.
You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional.
I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day.
Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense?
Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience.
From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good.
Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events.
This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those.
This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible.
I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general.",0

Joker,The Damn Trailers...,"Holy hell this turned out to be a good movie. Really enjoyed it in the theaters. One of the few comic movies where you actually start feeling something for the main character. The empathy is born from the good writing and the phenomenal performance of Joaquin Phoenix.The only thing mildly bad stuff about the movie -which isnt an issue about the movie- are the trailers. Dc did it again with the ""lets expose almost every scene in the movie with trailers"" mindset. Dont get me wrong the first teaser with the ""Smile"" piece was really cool and got me hyped for the movie. But it felt like I kinda knew what was gonna happen already. I dont mean the whole scenes itself but where Arthur is gonna in the next scene and stuff.Even if the trailer kinda ruined my first watch I whole heartedly recommend this movie to everyone.",0
Joker,"An important, difficult, and beautifully artistic film to watch","I think it's understandable to see why people wouldn't like this movie, it's not a base villian orgin story that we expect from marvel or DC and I think many people expected that going in. The film is very uncomfortable and that's the point. At no point do you feel like the bad things Author is doing is ok, you know it's wrong but you have understanding on why this broken man is making these choices and the situations he's been forced into by predjudice and violence from an outside society. The praise for this movie is well deserved and the messages and themes are important and should be dissected.

It was a movie that made you want to root for the bad guy.The only thing I find unfortunate, is that this seems like as good as it's going to get. WB is not going to give Todd Phillips the freedom to continue what he did here again now that it has made so much money. Even if they did, would the magic of this film be recaptured?

Joker,The most artistic film of the decade,"There are many good movies, a lot of great movies but there are only few movies that leave a mark on your conscience and make you think twice & give you lessons about what is life and how to live it. Joker is a movie that touches your heart in every way possible. It's the story of the world's most notorius & popular villan's life before he became a villain. What made him become a criminal and what pushed him to spread anarchy all over Gotham City.
It's a movie about how people change because of the people around them & how a man becomes a criminal because of the society in a light that we never saw before.
It's the most artistic movie because of it's character potrayals, all over music score, the screenplay, the directon & the cinematography.
Joaquin Phoenix also did an excellent job in helping the Joker to come back to life. There were no flaws in his acting & he did justice to the character & that is the hardest job to do.

Joker,The best movie of 2019 that perfectly captures this moment,"Brilliant film, in some aspects it's even better than its inspirations.P.S. To all people who constantly and annoyingly complain about Joker borrowing from old movies: you are giant hypocrites and terrible people. All movies borrow from other movies and works of art, you complain about that only if you didn't like the movie. Take a look at your favourite movies and tell me again this bs about originality. The Matrix ripped off a lot of stuff from the famous sci-fi books and manga. La La Land ripped off old musicals. Terminator and Aliens borrowed a lot from Robert A. Heinlein books. Reserviour Dogs literally ripped off City on Fire and The Killing, literally the same scenes in the same context. The Revenant copied shots and scenes from Tarkovsky movies. There's no original shot in Kill Bill. And I can go on and on. So stop with this bs about ripoff and originality and just say that you didn't like the movie if you didn't like it for the reasons that have to with the movie itself.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Oh Joaquin, you are spectacular!","Maligned, manic, masked, wounded, Oedipal, lonely, fragile. An Oscar-bound performance from an actor whose career has been rising Phoenix-esque since 2010's disastrous mocumentary ""I'm Still Here"".Director Todd Phillips gifts Joaquin with the role of a lifetime in this character study set in a post-populist Gotham, riddled with crime and trash, tracing the spiral from awkward loner to Killer Clown. The casting of De Niro as talk show host (and surrogate father) is heavily weighted by his roles in ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" both of which resonate with the themes of ""Joker"".The now-iconic Bronx staircase, appropriately located on Shakespeare Avenue, is a perfect setting for our anti-hero's descent into villaindom. But with his backstory exposed do we condemn him or cheer him on? Thus the filmmakers present a fitting commentary on our times in this morally ambiguous tale.",0

In the last couple of years i basically gave up on movies, mostly everything new was to some extent bad to me. I'm so glad that this movie was made and that i watched it, i will most definitely watch it again as soon as possible.

Joker,Phoenix nails it,"I cannot believe what a great actor Joaquin Phoenix is. From the evil emperor in Gladiator, an odd detective, a guy that falls in love with an operating system and now Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Only few actors reach the same height, but none would've played this role so well, not even Heath Ledger. Ledger's performance was legendary, but it takes another skill set to play an origin story.
I cannot help but feel empathy for poor Arthur, who is trying to live by the rules which a society that spits on him have enforced upon him. He actually seeks help, but the system fails him.  I still felt myself rooting for Arthur, I could certainly understand his motivation.
This might be the best film of this decade. I really hope Phoenix reprises this role in a later film. The score, cinematography, acting are all at least 9,5/10. Extremely recommended!2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

I'd deliberately avoided all reviews and trailers ahead of visiting the cinema and boy I'm glad I did.It's been many years since I've attended a Sunday evening late showing in a cinema with a barely an empty seat, and each seat left entertained! The crowd when leaving were buzzing, something a kin to leaving a mega rock concert. That surely illustrates how good this is as an experience.Super Rats...haha, wonderful.Todd Phillips has made one of the films of this millennium,...and that's not an over statement. This maybe Joker but this film paints a connection closer between graphic novel and modern day society with its Inception-esque divides and dying lack of humanity and empathy.The Joker is made by and reinvents society. A CLASSIC!!! Thank you Mr Phillips and Mr Phoenix (and all involved).",0
Joker,Haunting and captivating take on a villain,"This is by far my favorite movie I have seen. I rarely go to the theater, but I saw this movie on opening day with a friend, as well as the day after with some different friends. Without giving away spoilers, this movie is atmospherically a psychological horror movie with no jumpscares. Even causal movie fans will leave the theater unable to stop thinking about it.It's sad we don't get many movies like these. I will definitely watch it a third time when it comes out digitally. Don't watch it if you didn't enjoy Taxi Driver, or The Machinist. It is also not for children or people who are sensitive to certain topics.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A masterpiece,"It's not often a movie makes an impact on me. In fact it's close to rare. 
""Joker"" is a unique masterpiece in so many ways. I am absolutely blown away by the acting, music, cinematography, script, makeup, and the whole feel this movie has. It's dark, sad and very realistic. It does a great job at showing the viewer, a story of a troubled mind, and answers the question ""What if the joker lived in our world. How would he have gotten there. What could push a person so far out, and hate society so much"".
The scary thing is, you can really relate to his journey.
Wonderful job everyone on the team of this movie.
And kudos to DC Comics for daring to make this movie.
Thank you.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Empathy Dies and A Joker is Born,"Joker is making lots of headlines. Here's my take. Joker is a peer to A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver vs. a superhero movie. Joker is a very dark character piece on how a damaged loner is alienated beyond his breaking point. This is a very disturbing and excellent film. Joaquin Phoenix will be a Best Actor nominee for certain. The movie is drenched with important issues- mental illness, income disparity, healthcare, and how a society responds when these needs are not met. Joker is about the death of empathy. Jokers are created, they don't fall out of a comic book or become evil because they played too much Grand Theft Auto. I've read about folks walking out of this movie. I hope that those folks simply miscalculated, thinking they were going to see Iron Man or Captain America. The alternative reason is choosing not to see the seeds of dystopia all around us2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,The best film in 2019,"Ok..so I never write reviews. Ever. Especially on IMDB where they kind of force you for a certain length, spoilers alert, and so on.Anyways..if you're looking for an action movie, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. This is a piece of art. This is the best film in 2019. Or the best film I've seen in years. The acting, directing, cinematography, editing (colorist!!!), the score, the script, EVERYTHING is perfect.Joaquin Phoenix & Todd Phillips are brilliant; each of them in their own way and role.

Joker,Joaquin plays a perfect tortured Joker.,"I saw the hype. I saw the negative spin the media tried to portray the movie in. I saw the reports of the eight minute standing ovation at the screenings. I saw the review bomb attempts the Rotten Tomatoes professional critics were giving Joker. And I went and watched the movie myself. Joaquin Phoenix has created a man who had his entire life and beliefs fall apart in a week, and learn that even those closest to him never really knew him, or lied to him, or were responsible for the pain he was going through his entire life. The worst part was, they did not even care or notice what had been done to him. His story, this take on Joker, this is what creates a supervillain, a man so broken by society that his last resort is to laugh at the futility and sadness and rage that has been forced upon him.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

I was curious to see how he would approach the character and how the troubled soul would become 'The Joker'Todd Phillips has somehow tied the story in perfectly with Bruce Wayne and his parents, whilst using the platform as a homage to other films from this era (1979?), like King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It's both familiar and utterly unique.It's a scary portrayal of how a mentally troubled loner who is wronged by society can find comfort and their smile through dark means.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,We need more than a movie we need a series of Joker films,"We need a sequel of this phenominal origin story of the darkest villian ever.
Hats off to Todd's direction and the performance by Joaquin is breathtaking. This is best acting directing combo I have seen in recent years.
The cinematography is so beautiful that's I got completely hooked.
And making it R-Rated did the complete justice to this movie. We wouldn't grasp the darkness of Joker's character if it wouldn't be an R-Rated.
Some might argue that it's depressing. That's because the acting and the story is so amazing.
I was shocked that the movie is about a villain and I was feared that without a hero. It won't have to show but the character development of Arthur to Joker is really an amazing journey.
Besides, some scenes are so intense that you won't move your eyes from the screen.
The music was also wonderful and dark ofcourse.
Joker is spoussed to be the most dark, psychopathic, terrified, and weirdest villain. And Joaquin's Joker went beyond from all these villainous characteristics.
I truly hope that WB must think about making a spin-off series of Joker.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Send in the clowns!,"Excellent casting, wonderful directing. A lot of thought has clearly gone into every scene. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. Music works well. All in all, a very good piece, yet not your average comic book adaptation.To those saying there's too much Joaquin in it: this is a character study and much of what we see is through Arthur's eyes.
To those commenting on Joaquin overdoing it: he plays a mentally unstable character, yet manages to portray every feeling in a believable way.
To those complaining there is too much drama, too little Joker specific mayhem: this is the becoming of.
To those saying it's depressing: yes, living with a mental illness is depressing. And no, society does't do much to help. (Do you never see impaired people being ridiculed in real life?)
To those commenting on how Gotham is dark: why was there a need for Batman, remind me?For the critics: get over yourselves.",0

Joker,Not for Everyone,"You know a movie is great when the majority of the ratings are 1 or 10 stars. Obviously based off the 9.2 it's got a lot more 10's than 1's and there's a good reason for that.Those who gave this one star are either one of two things:1. Marvel cultists who will bash anything DC ever does.
2. People that went to this movie expecting it to be the usual cookie cutter superhero movie that is watered down in order to pander to both children and men...Anyways... You will either hate or love this movie. I don't believe there is an in between. It is provocative, vile, dark, and occasionally hard to watch, but aren't all the greatest movies?These are all elements of the world around us and we cannot just pretend like they don't exist, or blame movies for causing it.If you have a villain who is an insane, manic clown, then showing what led to that is not going to be pretty. It can't be.If you want sunshine and rainbows go watch Marvel on the Disney Channel.The character development in Joker was amazing, showing us how a comedian turned into a psycho-killer clown. Todd Phillips killed it, and Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his greatest performances ever.If you are reading this review and you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do; just go into it with an open mind, and realize that this is not your average superhero movie. This is a beautifully dark standalone film showing the transformation of Arthur Fleck, comedian, into Arthur Fleck, psychopath.",0

Joker,Words alone couldn't describe how beautiful,"As a DC comic fanboy, it completely blew me away. Words alone couldn't describe how beautiful this movie is. Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, terrifying, Masterpiece, every second.Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie. Everything about this Movie is masterful in every single way! Just as Christopher Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight Trilogy, #Joker is unlike anything we've ever seen before.I was pretty sure no one ever could match Heath ledger's Joker. But I was wrong, This might be the best DC film ever made. Joaquin pheonix breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing did the impossible. Heath ledger will be happy watching this movie from heaven.The film offers a dark look of 1980's Gotham City, as we never have seen before in comics. It brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.This movie kind of mirrors how I feel on a day to day basis. I would say its way better than the Endgame and The Dark Knight, but that's for me üòâ

Joker,"Critics are kinda funny, aren't they?","I saw this movie yesterday and I was completely blown away by it. To say Joaquin did an amazing job is kind of pointless, because I can't think of a single movie where he wasn't amazing.The way Joker is ""set up"" through Arthur's experiences is clever and compelling. The movie is not as action packed as you might think, but I was shocked at some of the events and it was actually painful to sit though some parts of it. Not because it was too violent or something like that, but because you could actually believe the character was in real pain.I could talk all day about all the things I loved about it. But what I think it's really funny is that some critics are actually bashing the film. I shouldn't be surprised, but right now it has a score of 58 on Metacritic. IMDB score is 9.3.As I was reading some of the critics' reviews, I was actually asking myself if I went to see a different movie. But, you know, everyone's got a right to their opinion. The sad fact about ""the critic"" is that these people get paid to say things like ""Joker, an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing"" - The New York Times.Well, maybe some people are too smart compared to normal people like me. But, at the end of the day, the bright side of being a normal, maybe ""stupid"" person, is that you can enjoy the little things in life and be amazed everytime a star like Joaquin lights everything around him with his talent.I guess critics are already too bright, so there is no possibility of an enlightenment to them. Stupid people like me are tempted to think they are actually living in the dark.",0
Joker,One of The Darkest Films *EVER* Made; A Masterpiece,"An ultra-dark sociopathological study steeped in deep nihilistic psychology with wildly-violent social commentary, Joker is A Clockwork Orange x Taxi Driver x RFAD with a career performance_by_Phoenix_on_supervillains'_origins._9.8/10....Review: The Joker. 80+ years of chilling sociopathological laughs, psyche-haunting as sadistically as he does The Bat's in devilish chaos untempered by morality, and the ability to bring entire cities to their knees with no superpowers - ""just a few bullets and drums of gas."" But where does such an icon of evil - the greatest comic book villain of All-Time - come from? What indescribable tragedies or societal/mental-breakdowns could mold a normal citizen into a demonic presence bent solely on carrying out some dark marching order to leave death and destruction everywhere he goes? The Dark Knight had plenty of fun with this concept, spinning the scariest thing about The Joker - the fact he could come from anywhere as a symbol of the volatile darkness and sin lurking just underneath the surface of society - with multiple incongruent origin stories tailor-made to Ledger's next victim's biggest fear (R.I.P. Legend). As did The Killing Joke with a lightly-expositioned tease that still left more than enough gray area/ambiguity in origin. When this film was first announced, I'll admit: I was vehemently against the concept out of agreement with Nolan's analyses on the subject and personification of evil it would take a damn masterpiece, a film so dangerous police would have to guard the premiere, and game-changing descent into madness.. to make work. I'm happy to say, that's what we got.The stylized violence and portrait of a man broken by society. Phillips was kind of the odd-ball in the mix here; a wildcard that - known best for his savage comedy days of The Hangover - was the farthest thing I'd expect on the radar of Scorsese-like prospects to produce such a deep, dark psychological study that's anything but funny. Yet he impressively puts on the boxing gloves and tackles the un-tackle-able giving one of the most stylized portrayals of violence and darkest films EVER made - reminiscent of (and perhaps even at-level or *passing* All-Time Classics like Taxi Driver and A Clockwork Orange). His controls the slow, hypnotic descennt into madness of an innocent, even-puffballish man you could never possibly imagine could become the Joker into the man of the house with surgical skill and detail - slinging soul-wrenchingly dark tragedies at him with the help of the screenwriters like some messed-up God bent on his demise for our entertainment like the court's jester the character is modeled after. The violence and psyche-breaking macabre painted is absolutely brutal and some of the darkest and most audible gasp-inducing I've *ever* witnessed; we see a man stabbed in the eye then head thrown against the wall repeatedly until his brain's squished to mush while his blood splatters Phoenix's white bare face with that hint of red completing his joker make-up, on screen executions with a revolver, hospital patients suffocated, and child abuse with freaking radiators and beating him all swirling a completely-realistic backstory of where a guy like The Joker could come from. Philips even fits in some fan service amongst all the psychologically and viscerally-heavy sociopathology in Batman references and exact recreation of the finger gun recreation from Taxi Driver and royal blue Dark Knight police car-reversed shot also ending on a Shyamalan-ic twist ending not even breaking comics lore!Phoenix's performance. Already one of the top actors in the world boasting an illustrious 3x-Oscar nom'd filmography from the visceral You Were Never Really Here to opposite-spectrum Her and The Master, Joaquin Phoenix predictively rises to the ultimate supervillain role in unbelievable fashion. Nicholson said the role ""does something to you."" Leto did not break character the entire time while filming even sending castmates dead carcasses and prophylactics leading them to question if he was okay, and the All-Time legendary Ledger tragically lost his mind in the role ultimately overdosing in a hotel drug/madness-fueled rage unable to separate from reality any longer: THAT's how powerful this role is. Phoenix tackles it with masterful skill and ballsiness for one of the greatest performances of his career and a life-time take on the villain to end all villains - so visceral down to even miniscule details like physicality, varied going from innocent puffball to sadistic killer by the end of the story, and impressive in laugh alone it demands dissertational exposition - reportedly watching over 250+ hours of an actual medical/psychological condition called sociopathological laughing wherein patients laugh uncontrollably while unable to express other emotions - for that twinge of sorrow that finds immaculate fit in Phoenix's tragic-comedian portrayal. The rest of the performances by its storied cast are phenomenal too, especially Pacino's downright-sadistic talk show host milking victims for cash and fame, Zazie Beets' (not so) love interest, Frances Conroy's Wayne-obsessed mother so cold she questions her own son's dreams with lines like ""don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?"", and Cullens' evil portrayal of Thomas Wayne.Intellectually-complex sociopathology study and social commentary on extremely-important topics. The film tackles mental illness, consumerism, ""woke""/cancel culture, social media culture, human nature, noir-elements, and multiple philosophical ideologies from nihilism to cynicism.. all in under 2 hours through a comic book/supervillain-lens for one of the most impressive screenplays ever produced. As its tagline alludes to, we are all taught/conditioned from the time we are young minds - silly-putty in society's hands - to put on a happy face and hide our pain/failures while extenuating our accomplishments (real or fake) desperately seeking 5 minutes of fame or the approval of people we barely know to convince us our lives have meaning, whether it's fame in olden days or on social media today. That invisibility feeling mirrored by the effects of bullying for the enjoyment of others is dangerous and breeds violence/criminality of potential Joker-proportions as the film correctly brings to light also playing off the at-tim.. well, often-cruel (self-interested, greedy, etc.) nature of humans picking up right where Taxi Driver left off in harsh sociological analysis. The script is so dastardly in setting up the strings for Joaquin's transition to Joker that it presents us some of the harshest events a human being could endure - also definitely-realistic especially in this time period seemingly devolving in sensitivity/empathy as time goes on - like men of power and influence abandoning/covering up/locking away marital affairs without giving the victims even a dime of their billions, or inviting losers on their talk show just to embarrass them in front of millions as proto-clickbaiting as a showcase highlighting some of the worst, most callous, brutalistic, animalistic points of human nature surprisingly-widespread in society if you sit down and think about it. The mental illness cogitation is also phenomenal and IMPORTANT, playing up the depressed nihilism or even-suicidal thoughts these illnesses can induce with haunting quotes like ""I have never been happy for even one minute of my entire life"" and ""you ask weekly if i've had any bad thoughts - *all I have* are bad thoughts"", also hinting at its bludgeoned treatment by a society for just another instance of how cruel the system is rivalling any supervillain playing down serious medical conditions with terminal effects as ""fake"" or ""not a big deal""; ""something to suck up""; ""get over"", etc.Flaws in Joker are singularly limited to its opening. Irising-in to the dressing room of Phoenix's Arthur and him listening to crime reports while doing his make-up and enacting the cry/forced hands-smile from the posters is a bit premature and abrasive when we have no idea what's happened to make him so sad. The film takes a few minutes to get comfortable and hit its stride, but once it does - it is absolutely glorious. The crying over SJW-isms and controversy surrounding the film is absolutely *ridiculous*: 1) any real critic with even a shred of journalistic integrity can separate a legendary, All-Time great film from a couple of political disagreements (I also didn't see them have problems with in Taxi Driver or A Clockwork Orange as virtually-the-same concept but now a problem due to the times it's fashionable to be constantly-offended, virtue-signal, and be fake-""woke"" than do your duty to your field, 2) it's a VILLAIN origin film, what do you possibly expect: lightness and no violence? Also, villains have been humanized for empathy countless times in superhero media from Raimi's 2005 SM2 Doc Ock to Kingpin's family in Into The Spider-Verse mere months ago but not a peep of complaints it sounds like people just hold DC to a 10x-harder/impossible hypocrisy scale, and 3) do white men not deserve any empathy for objectively-tragic things happening in their lives like mother-strokes, child abuse, learning your *entire life and entire parenthood was a lie*, etc.? That is the opposite of ""woke"" if you ask me and animalistic disregard for human suffering with no compassion or empathy - democracy is founded on the difference and freedom of beliefs and expression it's literally racist and sexist to silence some by definition.Overall, Joker is one of the darkest films ever made and a masterpiece 2nd only to The Dark Knight for starting the ultra-realist trend in comic book films.An ultra-dark sociopathological study steeped in deep nihilistic psychology &realism with wildly-violent social commentary, Joker is A Clockwork Orange x Taxi Driver x RFAD with a career performance by Joaquin Phoenix on supervillains' originsOfficial CLC Score: 9.8/10",0

You will feel his pain , his sorrows , his dreams , his anger... you will become .. the Joker. The movie got a standing ovation at the end. In fact, I got so much into the character, that I could correctly guess what the Joker's reaction would be , in couple of crucial scenes. This is what Tod Phillips and Joaquin Pheonix have achieved.

Joker,Why Todd Phillipps Made This Film,"You will notice the far left journalists: the New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Guardian and the rest all despised ""Joker."" They made up different prevarications such as no fun, meaningless, nihilistic, dangerously provocative and on and on. The real reason they had to gang up on this film and Phillipps is that we are seeing this fantasy become reality in America.The far left run cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago and others look like Gotham. They are literally overflowing with filth, drug addicts, mental patients roaming free and bureaucrats running and enjoying it all. The are supported by hypocritical filmmakers with loads of money, politicians, and business leaders.Phillipps is famous for non-PC, in-your-face comedy: rude, crude and breakout funny. But he cannot make films like that anymore. No one can. The far left speech police are violent, hate-filled, arrogant and stupendously self-righteous. Joker is the far left dystopia that is our future, coming soon to a neighborhood near you. They want the border eliminated, jails opened, locks broken and the rights of middle class citizens taken to allow mass bedlam.They want the hard working, value driven bedrocks of society mutilated, defeated and destroyed in the ensuing melee. That has been their dream as under-realized by Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and modern socialists.This is a great film. It is a monumental film. It is not a comedy, it is a horror film. It is the kind of horror film few people pay to see: psychological horror and terror. Then why has it already made more than a billion dollars? Because there are so many people cheering for this very outcome. Others see it for it's greatest value: a look at the future.",0

Joker,The best Joker in history,What can I say? I'm a massive Batman fan and a little obsessed with the franchise. I wanted to watch this movie to get a background on the Joker to complete my Batman experience. I've watched every Batman ever made including the Adam West TV show as a kid.I came out of this movie in absolute awe and to be honest a little emotional. It was a beautiful portrayal of a beautifully mad man. I feel emotional after watching it. It spoke to me on so many levels. What would happen if we just let go and have in to the voices in our heads and ignored societies restraints? This was what happens.Hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt. Heath Ledger looks like Bonzo the clown compared to this. As for Old mate from suicide squad he needs to never do another one.11 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0

Joker,A Masterpiece,"This was one of my best moviegoer experiences!
Joaquin Phoenix is simply brilliant in this role and the movie is much deeper, darker and grounded in reality than any feature film in the Batman universe.

Joker,The BEST movie I'VE EVER SEEN,"I've never written a review or rated a movie before. BUT this! I had to. This needs to get as much positive recognition. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE. With all it's darkness, Reality of society. This is REAL. A movie to make people uncomfortable to make people see and understand. A movie where they can't turn away. I hope this brings awareness. How to be kind to one another. But over all this movie was genius. Epic. BEAUTIFUL.11 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Not a Joker film, however...","I guess the people not happy with this film expected a typical ""Joker"" movie. It's not. It's a film about the man who 'becomes' the Joker. A character study. This is not a feel good movie and don't expect to leave the cinema feeling happy. It's depressing, it's bleak and it's quite uncomfortable to watch at points. It has a constant fog of dread hanging over it that's heavy.
You feel sorry for this person, probably even root for him and that's a real weird thing as we know what he eventually becomes, but I suspect that was the point.
The music score is outstanding, adding massively to the film in no other way I can think of than how the track from Jaws impacted that film so much.
The filmography is also top not notch.
Phoenix is absolutely electric, you cannot take your eyes off him. If he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, he might as well pack up and forget about it. He could do no more.
Best film I've seen in a long time, which is a weird thing as, again, you don't leave with a feel good vibe, but it's all the better for it.

Joker,A perfect tribute to the Joker!,"The character of Joker received much more love even though being an antagonist in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Todd Philips did a phenomenal job of creating an origin story for Joker and had the guts to present a standalone movie to the public. This movie leaves you in a shock for a moment and makes you think a lot. Some shocking moments that totally grips you, I find no reason as to keep this movie reserved for only 18+
Camera movement and the shots taken are so cool that they deliver a story without a single dialogue being said. This movie keeps you glued to the screen till the end credits roll in.It is a must watch for all Joker Fans and I believe the count of these fans will increase all the more!11 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Incredible and captivating,"One of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. This movie has a lot of levels. The psychopath construction is uncomfortable and attractive. It brings an invitation to ask ourselves if the concept of ""good and bad"" makes sense. Because all of us have the potential to become monsters when we're not able to control nor understand our own demons. But only some can exploit their true nature by being precisely a monster. And that keeps me thinking about the bravery and its shadows. It's a movie that hangs onto you and assaults some proper ideas during a burst of laughter. Joaquin Phoenix does an unbelievable job, he's one of my favourite actors and his work impressed me deeply. Incredible art direction, the colours and photography are the perfect apology for Mr Todd Phillips's masterpiece.Incredible and captivating.14 out of 27 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,The best film of the year and possibly the best of the 21st century,"What to say about this film that does not reflect the title, is the best we have been able to enjoy lately, everything is wonderful, the exquisite photography, the right atmosphere, the amazing and unsurpassed script, all seasoned in addition with a sublime direction of Todd Phillips, which shows that we must follow him very closely in future projects.
And I leave a point exclusively for Joaquin Phoenix, the guaranteed winner of the next Oscar, in my opinion it is one of the best male performances in the history of the seventh art, I do not think there are concrete words to do justice to his interpretation, therefore I will not say anything else.

Joker,Amazing. Captivating. Immersive. Raw.,"I am typically a fan of what Marvel has done, and initially saw no point to this movie when it was announced and couldn't see Phoenix doing the role justice, particularly after Heath Ledger's brilliant take on the Joker.
How wrong was I? This movie starts slowly, and draws you into Arthur's world without you realising it until you can't look away from the screen for fear of missing a single second of it. It is raw, it is personal, it is disturbing, it is sad, and it is deeply resonant of some of the troubles we are experiencing today in the world. This is the Joker, arch-nemesis of Batman, yet you feel empathy for him, and can't completely disagree with his actions. He only hurts those who he perceives hurt him, even if his justice is fatal and doesn't befit the crime. ""Wrong me, and you are dead,"" is not justice, and each of his victims display their own weaknesses and frailties, and aren't inherently bad people.
This is a brilliant movie. One of the few I went back to the cinema to watch again. It deserves Oscar recognition for Phoenix, Todd Phillips, cinematography, and the score.
Congratulations all round!14 out of 27 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Possibly the best movie of all time,"I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting.",0

Joker,"As a fan of comics and good cinema, Wow!","As a lifelong fan of western comics, anime, TV sci-fi and cult & masterpiece movies, this film truly is a historical landmark of cinema. Kudos to Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Phillips, they have achieved something no one else had until now in the superhero genre, true art (Except maybe Nolan's and Ledger's Dark Knight).
Superhero-wise, this Joker has been brought to us under an entirely different light. He makes you feel sorry for him, mad at society for having forsaken such a hurt man. Appaled of how the system can abandon a sick and lonely person in the time of most need. Truly despicable are crowds of people who mock a man dressed as a clown with a smile, but who cries inside. A cruel, bitter and tasteless joke this is.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Amazing tragedy,"Dark, twisted and amazingly disturbing. Arthur is such a complex character. This movie isn't just abou t him as a character but an example of how a mentally ill person lives and wants to be normal. I have a mental illness as well and I relate to Arthur perfectly, people have let me down, I've felt like my life was worth nothing. And we mentally ill people we just want to be noticed and understood, and that's what Arthur really wanted in his life, I perfectly relate to him. This film also tells us how bullying can affect the victim and what a cruel world this is. Otherwise, the film felt heavy and tragic. I watched it 2 days ago and it's still bugging in my head. Could definitely watch it again.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,The best movie of 2019,"This movie is phenomenal.

Joker,A masterful play between the lines of insanity and tragedy,"This truly is Phoenix's magnum opus. Few films are able to have such strongly resonating and impactful displays of violence that over the span of the film, through such an emotionally developed character, creates an uneasy feeling of genuine consequence to each driving action that Arthur performs in the creation of his alter ego.Phoenix's performance is so unnervingly raw the viewer is left perplexed by the deep insight into the constantly decaying mind of the man behind the makeup. A pleasantly surprising dedication to a role prior known only to fans of the character as a chaotic evil.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Simply Brilliant,"The whole movie, starting from the very first scene, connects to you deeply. It is a rare movie, I'd say, these kind of movies are made once in a century. It has all kinds of emotions, lows and highs, ups and downs, everything. The way they connect the story between Arthur Fleck (early Joker) & kid Bruce Wayne (Batman in future) made so much sense and had so much meaning to it. The script, story, screenplay, direction, everything in the movie was on point. The Music Director - Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir completely nailed the BGM.I don't think we can find any fault in the movie, because there was not even one single actor who acted a bit off.

Joker,Already a timeless classic...,"The comparisons to Taxi Driver are more than accurate and reminds you of other loner-vigilante style noir movies (Drive), but make no mistake, this has it's own mystique. Other people have already (and will continue) to explain why this movie is already a timeless classic. The themes explored here are ubiquitous in decades of character study cinema, but it never feels dull in this movie, it feels like a mind-stimulating food-for-thought.This movie made me FEEL, it made it's presence FELT. There was palpable tension in the theater, we knew we were witnessing something truly grandiose, but restrained enough to not push the pretentious border. It's a shame that this movie might have a stigma around it due to hyperbolic hysteria by headline/attention-seeking critics because there are far more violent films out there than this, this just happened to call out society and make the creators of a psychopath feel culpable, the truth hurts. This movie tells the truth.Joaquin Phoenix is a master at playing the brooding/unhinged role.If you watch movies for the purpose of wanting something to leave an impression on you, this is your movie. It does that in spades, and is one that welcomes repeat viewing.My movie of the year for 2019. Don't think another will come close. The House That Jack Built was my movie of the year for 2018, so I guess you can say I have a certain taste :)",0
Joker,DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS AMAZING MOVIE!!,"One of the greatest comic-book villain movies in years! This movie blew my mind away when I watched it and there was so much explaining necessary to actually figure out what the Joker's whole story is about in this movie! I even rewatched the movie to get an even better understanding to what's going on! What an amazing movie! But let's get to the aspects of the movie. The story is absolutely unique, being taken in a more realistic approach! He doesn't get dipped in acid and turn insane, instead its from real life factors that turn him insane! The joker already has a mental illness in the first place too and how the story sets off from there is truly shocking and disturbing! There is so much to this story to explain, even you can come up with many theories on joker's life! It's truly depressing but terrifying at the same time! Then the acting with the characters. Joaquin Phoenix did so good in playing the Joker that he deserves to win an Oscar for it! I would be shocked if he doesn't win an Oscar at all because his acting was spot on to disturb us and shock us! All the other actors/actresses that were left did great in their acting of their characters, with many giving a realistic reaction to the joker! Then the style of the movie. The movie did so well in not overusing dramatization and truly offered a great dark theme throughout the Joker movie! As much as I have to say, this movie is one of the greatest movies this year and its truly the greatest villain origin movie I've ever watched! Definite recommend for everyone to watch!",0

Joker,"Certainly not Jack's ""Joker"" or even Heath's still an excellent and dark artistic performance from Joaquin that had my face smiling and that's life!","Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!",0

Joker,THE PRINCE OF CRIME,"Watched it on day one, it's more than two months and I still have goosebumps. The movie isn't that original, isn't something that you haven't seen before, but it's original in its purpose and vision. Todd, Joaquin and the whole working team had made one of the most iconic movies of all time portraying a different and original version of the Joker we all know but he's a metal ill, twisted and a suffering man that tries to be loved, understood, he wants his tears to be dried and he wants to be one of us, but he can't, he knows he can't and for that he'll become something else, choosing a path that himself seems to not accept. Joker earns 10 stars from me, not only because it's a magnificent movie, but because it's easily recognisable and it will stuck in your minds as most of icons movies from the past has done with your mind. Last but not least: Oscar-worthy ? All-in.9 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Unbelievably Perfect,"I've never wrote a review, I regret every rating I've ever given a movie because of the tens I've put that pale in comparison to this masterpiece. What an amazing flick.

Joker,Outstanding,"I made an IMDb account just to write a review for this film and give it the 10 star rating it deserves. JP plays the role of Joker perfectly. Dark, disturbed, lonely, angry, he just nails every aspect and his performance in this film just has to be seen. He 100% has to win the best actor Oscar when awards season arrives.

Joker,"Well-crafted, tragic, and dark work of art","This is one of the movies that you watch and end up thinking about for a while after.
It's very rare that a movie makes you truly terrified and yet understanding of why this villain is the way he is.
The acting is absolutely incredible, hats off to Joaqin Phoenix for this legendary performance.
The soundtrack was haunting, eerie, and heavy. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's choice of using cello as the main instrument allowed for a very dark and churning sound that perfectly captures the turmoil inside of Arthur. Bravo!
The cinematography is breathtaking, the visuals are stunning, and combined with the meticulous directing and attention to detail, the final product ends up being a true masterpiece.9 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Hauntingly Beautiful,"Personally I was not ready for the intensity and the realistic nature of Jokers mental health. This version of Joker stands on its own and should not be compared to DC or Marvel. It's a Drama. I have never had a ""Comic Book"" movie give way to all the emotions I felt, questioning every part of humanity and how we treat each other makes a difference.

Joker,This is how DC movies should be made,"This movie blew me away. I was very hyped and excited for it, but I kept myself distant from the trailers and clips. Joaquin Phoenix is a now certified LEGENDARY actor!!! Jesus he was amazing in this movie, and delivers probably the greatest solo acting performance since heath ledger in the dark knight. I will admit the movie was a bit slow but I was easy to forgive since this is a character study kind of movie and it does say a lot about society. I won't go into deep specifics in this review but you'll know when you see it. I thought the cinematography was stunning of a run down Gotham City, the score was thrilling and mesmerizing. I can't get it out of my head, I just simply can't. I highly highly recommend this movie if you favor great acting and if you want your mind to be blown.

Joker,Award Material - Brilliant,"I avoided this film for some time due to an aversion to violence (thinking more about needless comic book violence) but today, with a storm blowing hard outside, I watched it.
Not at all what I expected and certainly not always easy to look at (and not due to the scenery or lighting which were both very skilled).
Others may describe the excellent technicalities of the film but I'd like to add a more sociological aspect. We, society, never learn do we? It goes round and round; in this case class warfare, deliberately ignorant government, mockery of those who suffer and the self-righteousness of the elite.
Well Joker shows us the consequences and as history holds it is always a form of revolution, in this case violence and mayhem in the streets of Gotham.
How reflective of today's world.

Joker,"A Deep, Dark and Twisted Masterpiece - No Film in 2019 Comes Remotely Close","I will start off by saying this review will be spoiler free, as well as a minor disclaimer for those thinking about seeing Todd Phillip's Joker.If you are expecting your typical, over-done, run of the mill comic book movie. You won't find that here. This is not a film filled with jokes that either work or don't work; this isn't a movie where the heroes always win. This is a movie centered around a troubled man and his descent into madness.It is dark and, at times, horrifying. And it is an outstanding masterpiece because of that. Had this movie been toned down, it would not have been nearly as great as it is.Joker is centered around a failed, mentally-troubled comedian called Arthur Fleck. He is constantly looked down upon by society, beaten and bullied. And, as you may have guessed, this causes him to slowly lose his mind and become the Joker. That's not a spoiler, by the way. If you think that's a spoiler, look at the name and synopsis of the movie.It's filled with shocking, gruesome scenes. Tense encounters. A realistic depiction of how it is to lose sanity. And it is absolutely terrifying. A once innocent man trying to chase his dream like so many of us is beaten and bullied, or often ignored by society when it matters, becomes ones of the most notorious criminals in all of comic book history.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance that rivals that of Heath Ledger. And at times? It trumps Heath Ledger's Joker. It is crazy and sadistic and, at times, honestly haunting. Terrifying, even. The writing is absolutely incredible in this movie and complements Joaquin's acting abilities. I don't think there could have been anyone better to star in this movie than him.Acting his fantastic across the board. But this review would be incredibly long if I wrote as much about them as I have Phoenix. But everyone, from top to bottom, contributed to this masterpiece extremely well.If you've not seen it already, go see it! Just do not expect this to be like anything else you have seen. It's dark, twisted and haunting. It's not a happy-go-lucky, joke filled superhero flick.10/10",0
Joker,Mary Shelly runs through Joaquin Phoenix in this masterpiece,"This dark film was something that I knew I'd see but maybe I'd wait til streaming release but without something to do on Halloween I took myself to movies.I did not read any reviews but as I sat in cinema watching every last credit scroll up the only word that seemed fitting was Masterpiece. It seems that's a word common to describe this.The frail and yet emotionally powerful physicality of Phoenix captivates and unsettles throughout.The clever weaving of different characters' storylines in this origin tale makes complete sense and nothing feels contrived. Whether or not (perhaps especially if you are not) a fan of superhero blockbusters this film should draw you in and haunt you.Much food for thought on how society deals with difference,...not paying lip service to it..the innocence of Frankenstein, grotesque and wanting love and acceptance in a cruel world definitely echoes in this universal story.I recommend to anyone who likes to be moved not just entertained..",0

(And no, i am not mentally ill)The entire movie is exceptionally well made, the story, the setting, the music and yes...

Joker,"Horribly brilliant, I wish I could unsee this film and watch it again.","Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, this is the best movie you will see this year.
This movie is a visual treatise on mental heath, abuse and social marginalisation. It has not much to do with DC and the fictional character. It perfectly explores how a human being can unravel into a sociopath. They could have easily called it 'Making a madman' or something.Not sure why they picked the 1980s but it worked well, the music is excellent and quite diverse in parts. Grimy downtrodden NY/Gotham looks awesome and suits the story.Heath Ledger was excellent previously but this film is rooted in brutal reality and it is so different to everything that came before that it is justified as a standalone masterpiece.8 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Even Gotham looked fantastic and I think this is the best looking Gotham ever. Sorry Chris Nolan even though you made the best Batman films. Phoenix really sold it.

Joker,Current and essential viewing,"Where to begin. An essential story that had to be told. Not because its the Joker. Not because its DC or Batman related. Because it is current.What is more important for film than to lure with one illusion, only to present something unexpected yet essential. The Joker does this effortlessly. Even if the Joker wasn't a well known character this production would have worked. The movie presents a picture for something very prevalent in global western society today; the disintegration of societal values, structure, and security and its human impact on the less privileged in society.Arthur is the ultimate anti-hero and through his journey emerges as perhaps a more powerful hero than his arch nemesis to be. A David v Goliath type story. A hero is after all someone who stands up for the weak, injustice and those who cant stand up for themselves; Arthur has these traits, though not in a conventional sense. The weak in his story is him; what greater hero than someone who stands up for themselves and emerges triumpant ? My statement will of course have many people screaming given Arthur's chosen methods. What underlies it all is a person fighting back the only way they know how, once they've been pushed too far; at the story's core, Arthur is simply screaming for ""help"".What about mental health you shout? He is totally messed up and off his meds. Of course, because mental health is just something that is the cause not the result? Mental health is correlated to societal values, function and security. Arthur's mental health is the result of his environment, so we are all to blame for Arthur's situation.",0
Joker,Wow,"This is such an important film. Not just for an amazing look into the depths of a character we know little about but also for awareness of how we act around others and mental illness. A great film; dark, twisted and a story that's beautifully told and shot. An abolute masterpiece of modern cinema.8 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,DC rising like a 'Phoenix' from the ashes,"This is not a popcorn flick, very difficult to re-watch and a must-watch for all the Joker fans of the world. I'm a fan of Mark Hamill, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, the Arkham games joker, the numerous comic book stories and the Gotham TV series joker and this one definitely deserves to be one of the best takes on the deranged clown. I heard that the weight loss took a toll on Joaquin's health, I hope he recovers as soon as possible. Regarding whether or not he deserves an Oscar, I don't think you need an Oscar to really brand an artist on how good they are if that were the case, Christopher Nolan, Will Smith, and Robert Downey Jr. would have a bunch of them. Nevertheless, I do hope he gets nominated.I was wrong in saying that WB doesn't know how to use the DC villains after witnessing that performance from Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor and the wasted opportunity to make Jared Leto the main villain in suicide squad. They just need to find the right directors and excellent writers that these characters demand. Well done Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast for giving us something so fresh, not everything has to be a part of a universe and lead to bigger battles, maybe that's the reason the film turned out so well because it was under no such extra pressure. Maybe WB can learn from this and focus on making now movies like this because we've had enough popcorn flicks and team-ups and it's not always about the box office money, it's about sending a message.After witnessing 23 Marvel movies and DCEU's desperate attempt to keep up with the MCU and it's constant but pointless protest that 'They're different than Marvel', Joker was a bit of fresh air that I needed and all the comic book fans in the world deserve. Maybe the writing in this movie was as good as I think it is or maybe game of thrones season 8 lowered the bar because anything other than 'I don't want it' and 'She's my queen' made me want to applaud the writers.",0

Joker,Great movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.I will be honest - i did not expected ""Joker"" (2019) to be this amazing movie. I saw trailer, i liked it, then read that it is heavily influenced on ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" and thought that its going to be at least an interesting and not by a numbers comic book movie. And i was right - its far from any comic book movie i have seen ever, except for ""Logan"" and ""Dark Knight"". Well, know there is a ""Joker"". What made those two films exceptional? Its that they went beyond and in different direction then you conventional PG13 comic book flicks from Marvel. ""Joker"" on the other hand is a great character study movie - first thing. If you would remove Gotham city and some characters from Batman universe, this film wouldn't even had anything to do with comic book movies. The other thing is that its just superbly done - this is hands down best movie Todd Phillips has ever made (and i loved first ""Hangover""). Cinematography was gorgeous and very stylish, music was haunting and editing was top notch - this film at its running time 2 h run like wind for me. Oh ye, and then there is the best performance of the year (so far) by Joaquin Phoenix - his Joker i think stands on the same ground with a legendary performance by Heath Ledger - its that amazing, and a bit even more complex because in Dark Knight Joker was a side character - in here he is a central figure, and what a great character that was.Overall, ""Joker"" is a great character study movie, and a very unique comic book film. Its different, for sure and make no mistake its great not because its different - its because the bold direction creators have went with it and delivered it full. This is one of the very best films this year so far.",0

Joker,Joke all you want,"Joker is a near two hour, dark, somber, cinematic masterpiece, where we witness the origin of the greatest Batman villains of all time, and understand in great depth, what made him what he is. We can see why Phoenix won the Academy Award, as this great actor has done such a great volume of work, and this is his movie to shine. He does so much with his character, a brave acting feat. The movie too, plays Jokes on you, as you'll see. Granted, Joker is dark, but is just totally engrossing from start to finish, no matter where you watch it. We praise the joker's murderous actions too. De Niro as a scummy t.v. show host isn't shown enough, and we almost forget him, as being so engaged with Phoenix's brilliant take on the super villain. Joker is a deep character study, of alienation, humiliation, twisted imaginings, rejection, all those negatives. He isa truly tortured soul, his family history only amplifying that torture. The music is eerily terrific, and we so feel for poor old Arthur Fleck. The dark piece, had me laughing a few times, at some lines, and Phoenix's laugh though a trifle annoying, you wanna hear more. Way more than any other movie, this is one that demands your attention. No joke.",0
Joker,A Triumph!,"Joker is not only the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life or the best movie of the 2010s, it's the greatest comic book movie. No comic film before or after will ever come close to this level of greatness. Everything about this movie from the gripping emotional story to the tone to the music the acting and cinematography is just amazing. The best part is no CGI and it proved you don't need it to tell a good storyJoaquin Phoenix plays the best live action Joker we have ever seen. Throughout the movie we see his character, Arthur Fleck, constantly abused, mocked, bullied and picked on by society just because he's different. That he has a condition and is viewed as an outcast. By day he works as a party clown, while also taking care of his ill mother. It gets to the point where Arthur reached his breaking point and slowly transforms into the Clown Prince of Crime as we knowThis movie also did a brilliant job with adding so much realism and how society treats not just people like Arthur but anyone in general. There's a lot of nasty people out there that will take advantage and leave you high an dry when they have no more use for youA true masterpiece and a work of art",0

Joker,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie, but somehow it gets better whenever I think about it.","I didn't want to like this movie.

The story is about a guy who was beaten by society and treated like garbage until one day he snaps and shakes the system.

This is outstanding.Yes it's dark and a bit disturbing at times, but it can also be taken as a life lesson to us all .Extraordinary acting performance from Phoenix and well worth his Oscar.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"The movie is about a character, not action or explosions.","Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies. This movie is about a character, not action or explosions. Joaquin Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and how power can be obtained. Todd Phillips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every other important aspect of the film. The movie gave me instant 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' vibes, without copying both films. This movie will drag you into your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better joker - Heath or Joaquin? The answer is - both did a phenomenal job. And Joker is fortunate to have being played by two phenomenal actors.
Finally, whether you like it or not, there's no denying you're going to be talking for a long, long time.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Absolutely amazing,I was unsure about how would feel about a stand alone Joker movie. Being a big Batman fan I was unsure what it would be like. How wrong i was. Jaoquin Phoenix 's performance as the disturbed and derranged Arthur Fleck and his descent into the clown prince of crime we all know was incredible. I forgot I was watching an actor and thought i was watching a documentary. He is on par with Heath Ledger's joker for sheer performance.

Joker,Profound. True to the core.,"The worst part of having a mental illness is people expecting you to behave as if you don't. Wow. What a truthful statement.

Joker,Transfixed on Joaquin,"So I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard some of the hype and I've always been a fan of the Joker stories in the past. I knew Todd Phillips was a decent filmmaker and Joaquin was an amazing actor. What I didn't know, was how well-crafted this film would be. I didn't realize the length of the movie wouldn't be noticed because of how transfixed you were on Joaquin as Joker. I was mesmerized! The viewer is completely immersed into Arthur's world. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall, watching and holding your breath from the intensity. It's truly amazing, to not see an actor but to just simply see Arthur or Joker. I haven't felt this immersed in a character since Daniel Day Lewis played Abraham Lincoln. He deserves all of the buzz, all of the recognition and all of the praise. I'm almost disturbed by his performance because it was so raw and so real. I'm just awe struck.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Best movie of the year,"There's not much to say, from Joaquin's acting to Arthur's descent to insanity, this movie was so good. I am just mad at the media for saying ""this is going to inspire introverts like Arthur to shoot up a movie theater"" just because there was was a shooting in The Dark Knight, another movie that happened to have the Joker. But in reality the shooter picked the biggest screened movie at the time at random. It's rare to see a movie like this actually come out because of all the censorship of the media and everything has to be family friendly. Remember when in 2008, Call of Duty: World at War came out, nobody really cared about the nazi imagery or violence but just cared that it was a great representation of war? Why can't it be like that? Why does everyone have to be offended by every small detail these days? I know this has absolutely nothing to do with Joker anymore, but I can't think of another movie that was controversial because of the media and turned out to be amazing, because all the other ones have all been scared to be too realistic. Anyways, this is great movie.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Best movie of 2019,"Masterpiece movie of the decade to influence generations.
Joker is a Traumatizing psychological drama/thriller that puts the spotlight on a comic book villian called joker.
Though the movie is inspired by the comic world which is imaginary, the movie feels real and authentic.
Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.
The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.
He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil.
The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.
The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.
The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.
Joker might be one of the darkest movies made in decades but definitely deserves to be watched with patience and attention because it's one of the few movies that besides giving audience entertainment it tries to make people think.",0
Joker,Hard to watch and so powerful,"I have to admit I have a short attention span however I could not even look away for a second during this movie.It's so hard to watch the pain Arthur is going through, battling with mental illness myself and seeing his journal in the beginning saying how people expect you to act like nothing is wrong hit home.This movie is not your average comic book, this is a deep though provoking drama.

Joker,Different Taste,"This movie come out with a different play I will say. Watching the trailer I dreamed about the movie would be much dark and more sympathetic to Joker. But in the hall I couldn't keep my eyes off the movie. It wasn't the movie that I thought it would be. Phoenix acting deserves some memorable rewards. I would recommend everyone can watch the movie if he/she has heart and brain to understand it. Do not go to the negative way, there is a lot to live in affirmative. Tod you are awesome.

Joker,Astonishing,The cinematic piece of art tells a unique and beautifully rethought origin story of the iconic villain Joker. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is captivating; everything from the way he dances to the way he forces smiles upon his face in the movie. The work of art integrates the stigma around mental health in our society today while dramatically showing how mistreated Arthur Fleck was by the fictional society in which he lives. Who would've thought that such a movie could be so moving? This film is special... the type that doesn't come around very often. It deserves endless credit and is 100% worth the watch.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0

However, after I came out of the theater I was shocked at the level of dedication needed to play the Joker.

His acting is so amazing that you forget that you are even watching a movie at all, and it is so mesmerizing to watch his new take on the Joker. This movie was engaging all the way through and had a perfect ending to match. What a fantastic movie.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Amazing !,"One of the best films I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. The unraveling of a person suffering from mental illness was tough to watch in some scenes but I never felt his behaviour wasn't justified. I left the cinema feeling sorry for a man who'd always felt different and had been treated badly from a young age. JP didn't just throw himself into the role , he became Arthur.

Joker,This is a movie that stays with you.....,"The anticipation that I felt walking into this movie is very rare. I can only compare it to the same feeling of walking into a Christopher Nolan movie or Avengers endgame. It's an incredibly high bar of expectation and there was a thick atmosphere of excitement in the theater. I found this movie to be a masterpiece of film-making with an incredible lead performance. It covers the full spectrum. Wonderful storytelling and emotional beats, mixed with powerful dialogue and beautiful cinematography. The movie doesn't shy away from violence, and there is even some humorous moments of levity among the chaos and madness. I can't say enough about Joaquin Phoenix. He's a very special talent. The subtlety of his abilities are a joy to behold. He's a master of his craft. There are many standout moments in this movie and it tackles many very real issues - such as mental health awareness and social isolation. Highly recommended.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Unparalleled,"Incredible, believable depiction of not only mental illness but of a man who can be seen as a legitimate human being in the real world. Unlike Heath (RIP), this Joker is less of a ""performance"" and more of a legitimate depiction of the real mental illness GOOD people face. He reconstructs what ""good"" truly is and, in contrast, the powers that be define what ""good"" is for their own advantage.Rant/related to movie content:

Joker,So real it's uncomfortable,"This movie is depressing, brilliant and so real it's uncomfortable to watch. That being said, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting I have ever seen and this movie delivers a very realistic look at how the unfortunate, mentally ill, weak and awkward live as well as how they are treated. By the end of this movie, I found myself actually cheering for The Joker fueled by the compassion and sorrow I had for his hardships and the lack of support he sustained from a society that not only failed him but made it clear that no one really cares. It leaves you with the realization that yep, this is the world we live in, the real world, where the rich and privileged rule. I wanted The Joker to make his official appearance and cause an uprising of people who are so sick of being ignored and treated like dirt that they find a hero from a crazy, violent, broken man. This movie does not hold back, it comes at you full force and stirs emotions that are confusing. We're not supposed to cheer for the villain. But then, who is actually the villain?7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Of joker and clap as hard as i could, i knew it, i was sure about it, it was the best movie of the years maybe even the decade, but no, i was the only one with my brother and one other guy who got up and clapped at how good the movie, but nobody else...Joker is a dark and slow drama/thriller about a man living in a bad and difficult place, this place is called Gotham, you already know this place by heart as a fan, am I right?No, the joker will surprise you on every point, the soundtrack, the twist, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Everything makes sense and is really well put and done in this film. You are not only following a terrible man who wants to destroy the world, no, you are following the growing hatred of a man who has tried everything to be happy but will never be.It's a masterpiece that people will be talking about for years and oh my God, please. This film needs a better audience rating than the other shameless, useless and senseless disgusting things called avengers.",0

Joker,"Joaquin Phoenix, That's All","Not a single Comicbook movie excited me until this one and that's because of Joaquin and Joaquin only. This character is tailor made for someone like him who has given terrific and criminally underrated performances over the years in films like The Master, Walk The Line, Two Lovers and Inherent Vice. Todd Philips made the right decision to a character study psychological film rather than the usual adventure/action.Gotham City is like NYC in 1970s/80s a city with massive wealth inequality, rising crime and brutal austerity measures. In surroundings like this, a fragile and broken individual like Arthur Fleck is bound to explode but how he does and why he does is what we see for 121 minutes. The undertones on anarchy, capitalism and classism is quite brilliant and this is one of the films where we cheer for the guy we are supposed to dislike.Joaquin Phoenix not only does justice to Heath Ledger in this film but creates an own legacy for himself. It's a shame that a guy who has given better performances in movies like The Master and Walk The Line will probably win his much awaited Oscar for this role, a highly popular character to get noticed.",0

It wasn't meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster with fast cars and CGI fighting rubbish.It was utterly necessary to have the elongated beginning, otherwise the brilliant cinematography and score at the conclusion would not have been so impactful.Phoenix, as usual, gave us a masterclass in acting. He lived every tiny schizophrenic moment of Fleck's mind and played it to perfection. If he doesn't win the Oscar this time, I swear I'll never watch it again!For me, this is the movie of the decade.

Joker,Brilliantly Crafted,"Since his chair as part of the official competition of the Venice Festival about a month and a half ago, ""Joker"" has become one of the most controversial, explosive and disputed films of the past decade. On the one hand, he came out of the festival with the Golden Lion and broke a glass ceiling for commercial products based on comic books, defined as a masterpiece by the European critics, and broke the United States in the last weekend. On the other hand, the American media pressed every name for a possible notoriety in the era of political health, director Todd Phillips became the social-boxing bag of societal networks, families of gunshot victims sought to scrap it and security was introduced to some of the halls in which it is screened. At the end of the last weekend, the film immigrated to Israel, and we could also see what the fuss was about.
Let's start with the only simple sentence you can say about the film: he describes the events that we know of the Batman, but this time from the jazz point of view, and tries to explain how the personality of one of the most famous arvillains in the popular culture has been played by Joaquin Phoenix, who went into the big shoes of Jack Nicholson, Heath and others who have done this before.
From here on, it gets complicated. It is easier to say what ""joker"" does not approve what he is. This is a sign that is hung this week in one of the New York cinemas, as part of the overall confusion of the country following the rise of the hit--""attention, please, it is not a comic film in the usual sense of the word, as you are.""
Indeed, ""Joker "" is really not a natural continuation of other successful arrangements for comic books from the last time. Not to Marvel's, and certainly not to those of the DC, whose legacy is based, although it has clear references to previous ""Batman"" movies. If we still have to say why this strange chicken is similar, it is a combination of psychological drama, a dark thriller, and a social satire. It is evident that its contents and style derive inspiration from the ""Taxi Driver"" and ""the King of Comedy"", two of the modern classics that Martin Scorsese created between the late seventies and the early 1980s, a fine and wild time in American cinema, which generally affects the film. Even the scene of his occurrence, the fictitious city of Gutheam at a vague point of time, mentions the cinematic representations of New York in those days, while there was still Sodom and Gomorrah of America.
And what about the man who becomes a gentleman? He suffers from a mental injury, which leads him to tell terrible jokes without being aware of it, and to burst into uncontrollable laughter, which makes him resemble some sort of Hollywood version of Assaf Ashtar at Comedy Store. His livelihood comes from his work as a clown, but even though he wants to make others happy, his hand is perceived as despicable, and brings back humiliation: Already in the first scene, a bunch of youngsters hit him on the street, and at a later stage, Thomas Wayne calls in contempt of ""clowns"" and all those lowlife living in his eyes that are not as wealthy as he is. This statement echoes of course the similar emissions that were made by Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton during their presidential campaigns against groups in the population, and strengthening the film's topical dimension.
If it is not enough for the hero's troubles, the capitalist elite's policy is leading to cuts in the welfare services and therefore also to the termination of the necessary treatments and the disease. And yet he has more hope: his mother terrorist planted him the faith that came to the world to bring them all a smile on his face, and that he would come out with something big. The open stage of a stand-up comedy club allows it to begin to realize this dream, and from there to bear eyes for the truly great fantasy--a performance in the program of his favorite light-Knight, Robert De Niro, that lihuku here is a wink to the ""King of comedy"", where they played the opposite role of an obsessive admirer of famous comedian (the same Played at the time of Jerry Lewis).
All this makes ""joker"" a smart, complex and relevant film that will be taught at universities and not only in the Department of film, but also mainly in social sciences. In the American media, audits were published that had been enjoyed by the arrogance that it was a foolish piece that was unaware of its meaning. The truth is reversed: there is not a moment here that is not on the banks of irony. If anything, the problem is that the result is so self-conscious that it already has something smug and more pressing.
In the end, the virtues cover up the disadvantages, which is the result that improves as it progresses, and the second part is powerful and even exemplary.
Behind this artistic success are some factors, other than the quality of the script we have already spoken about. First and foremost, the ""Joaquin Phoenix"" game, which officially establishes its status in the pantheon of the greatest, not only in his generation, but at all times. It is hard to think about many other players who were able to play such an extreme character without any phony character, and in a way that would make such a big impression. He is present in the film in almost every moment, carries him on his shoulders with dedication and a total determination, and builds a resting portrait.
On the side of Phoenix, though in a much smaller position, Robert De Niro reminds anyone who forgot what a big player he is. The two of these are the directors of the director Todd Phillips, who are not only in casting and guided by actors but also in all that is related to the scene, creating an atmosphere, placing a camera, editing, combining images into music and so on. Everything here is calculated, meticulous and effective, in everything concerning the picture and everything about sound. So, for example, once in a while we hear the movement of trains above the heads of the characters, which plays a double role: also creates a realistic sense of urban life, and also serves as a metaphor for a storm that is in the consciousness of the hero.
The film depicts a terrible reality: violent, popustic, passionate, hateful and almost merciless. What to do is the world we live in. ""Joker "" does not justify him, but just tries to understand how he was created, and how can I treat decay if you don't understand what his roots are? To me, this film is one of the five best movies I've ever seen, and I'm taking my hat off to anyone who's involved in his work.",0

Joker,You wouldn't get it,"I've seen it about 3 times now just to try and absorb whatever small bits I kind of left behind. This whole movie is a hot dish served cold.
The whole thing gave off a kind of almost Shutter Island feel in the end, the ""victory was a defeat"" feeling, but artistically... the movie is above and beyond and the way how raw it feels, how much empathy/sympathy it jerked out of me was amazing.In my weird head art is a huge category, where most if not all things fall into the mundane entertainment category, then there's art pretending to be art, then there's Art with a capital A. The kind where those who make it really push it, really make it unique and artistic. This is exactly it, without a shadow of a doubt. A prequel to the whole Batman franchise thay shines like a well polished diamond, so perfect and captivating it feels almost out of place and in a league of it's own.

Joker,A masterpiece,"Dc studios has been making bad movies since the dark knight series (which was great) ended until now! Joker is amazing, it's dark , deep but somehow through all this depression it's actually funny (in some scenes)! People who find this movie boring and don't like it are just finding something to take their anger out on! If you find this movie boring then you probably won't like a lot of other movies, the shawshank redemption for example (its the top rated film of all time)! Joker is a masterpiece that blurs the line between reality and fiction, it's a serious movie with a serious message and I loved every last part of it!

Joker,The making of a falling legend!,"This should have been the title of the movie. This is by far... the best ""the making of"" film in movie history yet.For a character that is well known and one that everyone has an opinion off, no one definitely knows how this character came to being. This version of the character development is by far the best version so far, for so many reasons.For one. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in this role. He embodies the very essence of what the joker has been through, through the ages, to become who he is.The script and direction of this movie is brilliant. It even gives glimpse into the very reality of why the Gotham universe is the way it is. There are so many moments in this movie that makes one realise the universe of Gotham and Batman, Of why they lead to certain events.For those batman fans who grew up reading the comics... you're in for a real treat! The screenplay and direction is superb in telling a story of the joker that develops its roots of what makes him over the edge, while also dropping crucial points on what could influence the becoming of other characters. ... things a lot of us have never realised were even connected.I can't wait for batman now and I truly can't wait for the next time batman and joker meet in this universe created by Todd Phillips. Here's hoping they do, coz I truly can't wait to see the outcome knowing what I know now, about their becoming.This is truly a film not to miss, for those new to the genre but truly love movies of substance and character, and for those who truly love the Batman universe. Go watch it now!",0

Joker,"The film shines a mirror on society, and society does not like what it sees.","There is so much that can be said about this spectacular film. Those who call it boring or dismiss it for being too violent are doing their best to quantify a piece of art they are not able to completely understand. Ennui only comes through disinterest and emotional/intellectual distance. The subtleties of Phoenix's performance to some, are undercut by his denial that he did not have to give himself to the role as much as previous Jokers have had to. People want a story of struggle and pain ending with high accomplishment. But the actor achieves this with skill and mastery of his craft. I'd watch the film again and again just to enjoy how Phoenix deftly makes be believe and empathise with a sociopath, a victim of circumstance in this interpretation.Brilliant cinematography and self-conscious homages to classic Scorsese masterpieces are testament to the wider scope Joker seeks to reach. The public seem so worried about how this film could incite violence and negative behaviour. My appreciation for the artistic calibre of this film resides it its ability to incite such controversy and opinion. Instead of shouting at the screen ask yourself why you feel the way you do and question your own tendencies rather than seek to project your insecurities on the world. What a film!",0
Joker,Joaquin Phoenix IS Joker.,"There have been many a Joker - from live action adaptations and animated adaptations - and this one, by Joaquin Phoenix, is the best one next to Heath Ledger's Joker. With this film released late in the year, perhaps Phoenix is a shoo-in for Best Actor. An excellent character study of a man battling a plethora of mental illnesses. Also, for those who have seen this movie, one question remains: How much of the movie is rooted in reality, and how much of it is in Arthur Fleck's mind? It's difficult to differentiate reality from fantasy.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,most important message of tis time - better then Ledger?,"This movie is astonishing,
This movie managed to tie all loose ends. The outstanding acting makes the movie so much more believable and realistic, and every character is designed perfectly and have major role in the plot.
The camera shots in this film are perfect, mostly wide blurred shots slowly creeping in making it so much more disturbing.
Plot - This movie is so disturbing and gritty just as it should be, it shows what really can happen in life when a person with mental health issues or even a healthy person that has hit rock bottom and has no one to help them 'back' up.The message is perfect for the times we live in, in 2019, the rich and healthy should not be separated from the sick and poor; from the mentally challenged. We should live in a society where anyone can be helped and anyone can be heard no matter what level they stand at, before they spiral.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema.,"JOKER 2019Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Philips & Scott Silver's JOKER is the ULTIMATE punchline to the 'joke' called society. It is a bold, raw, devastating and hauntingly beautiful character study, a social commentary and a flawless masterpiece - a cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema. It unfolds very very slowly but as it does, it punches you in the guts, punches you hard.Let me go back to one and a half year or more ago when they announced the movie. Being a hardcore Joker fan, I wasn't overly excited as I knew (as did everyone) that it is not possible to outdo Heath Ledger's performance as Joker. I was still intrigued as I heard Martin Scorcese was involved and Joaquin Phoenix was cast as the role with Robert De Niro in it. I wanted that different, crime-driven version. Then, over the course of last 12 months LOTs and LOTs of leaked photos and behind-the-scenes footages came out, and I wasn't quite liking what I saw. The production team seemed lazy as per security and keeping secret, something someone like Christopher Nolan wouldn't do. Then I heard that the script was being rewritten almost every day (which is usually a recipe for disaster) and my expectations were further down and it wasn't even my most anticipated this year, then there was the matter of confidence on Director Todd Philips who directed the crime-driven comedy 'The Hangover'. THEN, the unexpected happened and we got to see the first trailer and the second. And then, last month, the reviews came in, the movie won an 8 minute standing ovation from Venice Film Festival screening and won the 'Golden Lion'. Some of the hardest reviewers gave it full marks and called it either a masterpiece, or a cinematic achievement, or that a comic book movie has never been done in such way, and this opens up new doors and changes the movie industry forever. Well....whatever you heard and read are all true.Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance that cannot be described in words, even if I talk about it in person I will fail to describe it. I have never seen any performance like this, and I watch a LOT of cinemas. He did something impossible to the character that left us all awestruck and in disbelief. His version of Joker is of course different (the greatness of Joker character is - it is multi layered and can be approached in different ways) but if I'd have to compare it, it goes on par with Heath Ledger's Joker or maybe even outshines him. If I consider the best actors (Oscar Winners) for the last few years namely, Matthew Mcconaughey, Mahershala Ali, or Rami Malek, they were all brilliant but Phoenix outshines them all (little known fact, Phoenix did almost all his shots in single takes :O). Joaquin Phoenix has BECOME Joker. My sincere gratitude to Todd Philips, as whatever rewrites and plans he did, it came out as a beautiful bright art. It took him a whole year to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight the movie and 5 visits to Joaquin Phoenix's house to convince him. His depiction of Gotham city is raw, filthy and perfect. Cinematography also is Oscar worthy and so is the story. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's unforgettable score for the movie not only is a perfection but it almost literally talks to you during moments, especially during times when you're confused as to what is going on inside Arthur Fleck's (Joker) mind.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker will sadden you, cheer you, scare you, haunt you, and finally leave you scarred. Yes this movie is not for everyone and of course children should definitely avoid it. In the end, you will not know how much of it you can believe or was real, it leaves you to your imagination. So if you think this Joker has a definitive origin as opposed to Heath Ledger's mysterious Joker.....wrong, it leaves you to interpret it on your own way. When there is chaos we always try to point it all to someone, in JOKER though you wouldn't know whether you should point you finger to the society or Joker himself. When everything spirals out of control do you still endure it, or do you cross that thin line, or do you put a bullet through your head, what would YOU do given the same situation, because Arthur Fleck is one of us. Therein lies the mastery of the movie. During the final punchline of it you will roar as we all did - WE ARE ALL CLOWNS, LET'S PUT ON A HAPPY FACE.As Arthur would say ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, now I know it's a comedy"", apart from what this line represents, the final shot of the movie ends with a comedy. This movie will win multiple awards and Oscars as per my prediction and will be talked about for years. Indeed, one of the greatest cinematic achievement created with a $ 55 million budget. Don't wait for blu-ray, run to the theaters and believe me, it is worth every single penny of yours. This movie is disturbingly real, and relatable.I've seen it 3 times already and still stuck with the HAHAs in my head. I'm giving it a 10/10.",0

Joker,Send in the Clowns,"Scrolling down Instagram and Facebook you might come across this quote ""Put on a happy face"", ""Whenever happens you should smile"" and this quotes are the main theme of JOKER. The film begins with Arthur aka joker laughing and you can feel every emotion joker's laugh had except the emotion of happiness cause joker is not happy from inside and that's why he is going under 7 medications even though if it's not helping him. Acting - Acting is top notch, it's something you might have never seen before. Joaquin phoenix is quite old in age and that's why in close up you can see linings on his face and you can see how those linings make his laugh, and sadness more effective. With facial expressions there are macro expressions which you can notice on close up and those macro expressions shows the class of acting this guy has done. Music - Background music is top notch the song ""Send in the clowns"" fits perfectly with the theme and in some part the background score so perfect that it glorify the scene for example the scene where Arthur is checking his gun n there is this music played in TV shows which helps to intensify the mood. Makeup and lighting is even perfect after The dark knight if there's something everyone was talking the most after heath ledger's acting then it's his makeup. He himself did the makeup so it can be realistic and in this Joker makeup is good, simple, subtle and perfect according to the script, some small details makes you a fan of the make up artist like painting a kind of tear drop under the eye bags and at some places the right eye's blue colour is slightly spread because of joker's tears. The lighting makes you feel it's a 90's setting and dark film. Unpredictable storyline - Just like Spiderman far from home this film has lots of surprises for you and you cannot say what will happen next, anything can happen at any point and it is so balanced that you don't feel like there is too many surprises. The first half is quite slow but makes you feel pity over Arthur, the mental and laughing condition of Arthur and the way the people treats him makes you question about your way of treating people like that. The best thing of the film is it hasn't shown Joker has a hero they have shown him, it has shown him as a person who is the biggest villian of Batman and the reason behind his attitude. The film leaves the descision on you wheather what he is doing right or not and everything in the film is perfect and balanced and you cannot argue on that. If you like to see dark film and writes stories or you wanna be an actor then this is a must watch.",0

Joker,Loop Movie,"Well, this review will not contain any spoilers, although I must say, if you read it, just don't complain me for this poor society that we live in. This is, with absolutely no doubt, one of the movies of the century, one of the movies that has no precedent, just art, just a true show about the real downsides of this society, and still, humanity keeps failing, over and over again...I already know, that we (humans), don't have the same tastes, the same ideologies, and the same problems, but it's a bit shameful see the younger, just arguing (and with no real arguments whatsoever), that this movie is just boring, non interesting, and non relevant.Sometimes, we have to grow, to understand the real sadness, to understand the madness, the provocative world that we live in, but unfortunately some of the youngest have real problems, and I've already been there.For those who find this movie quite forgettable, just leave the cinema, and continue to see your favourite movies.For those, who can't get the job done (like, reading some info), before the movie session, try to do so on a future visit.Art is art.

Joker,Austerity in society hitting those most vulnerable.,"A brilliant use of current problems in capitalist societies, sheer the rich want to get even richer and so they demand governments and councils use austerity on the masses to fuel tax cuts for the rich.
One specific result is the cuts to services that help those with mental illness. Hence Joaquin Phoenix's character depends into an abyss from which the Joker emerges.
The dance sequence down the long set of steps to the Glitter Bands Rock and Roll (part 1 & 2), beats anything Fred Astaire could do.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this, then scrap the Oscars.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

This is going to go down as an all time classics and one of the darkest movies of our era.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A must see Drama\Thriller movie,"It's rare for me to give a movie 10 stars, but Joker is totally worth it.
It is a very strong drama movie that won't let you move your eyes for a second. the music and sounds affects are genius,
adding a lot to the general atmosphere - first when you get to know the Joker
and how everything is going horribly wrong.
It got to the part of the movie that there are supposedly comedy parts, but the director wants you to feel how it is wrong and not really funny.
The movie really make you get to know the joker's personality and creeps you out.
I watched it yesterday and I still get chills up my spine thinking of some of the scenes.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Can you combine a powerful story with a deep drama in a comic book movie?,"Normally, it helps me more to put DC or Marvel movies under a different category from other movies to be fair when I rate them, but this one was really on another level. A great script that gave us a deep story, well-organized chapters, superb acting performance and yes it was based on comics!
Even though it's a slow-paced movie, I didn't feel like there's a slow buildup in any chapters, which is not easy to avoid in these kinds of dark drama movies. Joaquin took the movie to another level, and it's really fair enough to say it's 'Joaquin's movie'. He really made every scene counted on the screen. I can't remember any scene was there just to help the story, not his character. Everything in the movie should be about him, and that's what he did.
When I watched the movie in the cinema, there were mixed emotions between the audience for most of the scenes. You don't know if you should laugh? or feel sad. These stressful situations were greatly made with the help of Joaquin's performance. He was always in control of these kinds of situations and when things require outsourcing support, the soundtrack comes in the right moment. Hildur made a great job by giving the soundtrack theme a character that I felt personally it's a little bit inspired by Hans Zimmer's masterpiece the Dark Knight, but with a more slow pace and dark feel.
I liked how during each chapter there were these scenes that look like some encaustic or painting to recap the joker personality changes.
Some people are saying the story is not 100% loyal to the comic, but what's wrong with that? Make a nice movie and implement all film success factors then I'm more than satisfied.
The only thing that I felt is not 100% complete after watching the movie for the second time is the last 20 min. I think it was necessary for an extra 15 or a maximum of 20 min for the last Joker personality transformation. But maybe the writer wanted to focus on what things that made the Joker as he is instead of the Joker himself. So yeah it's fine.
I know there are obvious ideas that can be reflected in other ones in the Taxi Driver movie, but it's really been used brilliantly. If someone watched the two movies and focused on the last Joker chapter, he will understand why I'm saying that.
It's really hard - without considering the comics' loyalty thing - to not give this film a full mark. It's been years since I watched a deep movie like this one.
I had a big question after I finished the movie, what's wrong in having a good script that leaves the freedom for actors to give a stunning performance in superhero movies? What's wrong with a good deep story instead of just counting on CGI? A lot of people are really starving for a well-written drama superhero movie. I hope Joker can help in this direction.",0

Joker,Oscar-worthy and Movie of the Decade,"This movie is truly a modern masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does justice to Joker where Heath Ledger left off. But I wouldn't want to compare both their performances as many have already said, ""It would be like comparing apples to oranges."" But I at least know that Heath Ledger can rest easy in heaven knowing Joaquin brought the character under a new light with his phenomenal performance. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really outdone themselves with this new take on The Joker. Joaquin and Todd bring a whole new aspect to Joker that has never really been talked about before, tackling the issue and importance of mental illness and a few other problems with modern society. And to address all the fear-mongering the media throws towards this movie, ignore it. Most of it isn't even relevant towards the actual movie and much of it are lies. I couldn't recommend another movie to watch over Joker. This movie will not disappoint. In fact, it goes above expectations (surely went over mine). Case in point, please consider giving this film a watch. I can't recommend this movie enough.6 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Who's laughing now?,"Modern America is like Murray show where opinions are created for greater masses & every difference is looked upon with contempt. Such is mindless campaign to boycott a movie because it will provoke violence in a country where gun can be bought while shopping for groceries.Joker is examination of people's behavior towards those in need, sick individuals who are pushed to the margins just because they need help. While city is choking in garbage, funds are being cut on social help & medical care, elite in suits are smiling while watching Chaplin. Wayne is not different then the others and he's finally given human approach rather then all good hero that tried to save Gotham in all other creations.There are no heroes in this movie, there is no light at the end of tunnel & there is no sympathy for titular character but rather a big punch in the face from Todd Phillips to all of us who are actually living in our own Murray show day in day out without ever taking time to reflect what surrounds us.Joker is a must see movie that will make you think about times we live in, about our role in the system & the ones on top never liked ordinary thinking people. Burton took his Joker straight from comics as he fell in acid, but Phillips only needed to put his protagonist in today's world.So who's laughing now?",0
Joker,A MUST WATCH!! One of the best movies of all-time,"""you are making fun of it, but it was serious to me""dem this scene still gives me chills since last night.
its rare to spot a good thriller with a decent suspense and ending nowadays, guess Christopher Nolan has raised the bar too high.but maaaan, Joaquin and Todd have just proved me wrong, Joker wasn't just great, but motha-****ingly AMAZING. The performance, cinematography, screenplay, storyline, music etc were absolutely stunning. It's not just a movie but also a whistleblower, a HUGE message to the world out there of what's still going on in our society.you can't compare Joaquin to Heath, they are both Ronaldo and Messi.

It has grown on me tremendously to become my personal all-time favorite film.I remember being absolutely mesmerized by this movie from the very first frame--it shocked me and left me in awe. After my first viewing, I actually had mixed feelings about the film because it's so hard to watch at times, I thought it was something that you appreciate seeing once but would never want to sit through again. But afterwards, I couldn't get the film out of my mind and when I found that just listening to the musical score was enough to bring back the intense emotions I felt during the film, I knew I had to watch it again, which I have never done in theaters before.I absolutely fell in love with the movie my second time watching it because I was able to fully appreciate the incredible acting, cinematography, score, and everything else that went to crafting this beautiful film. I have rewatched it numerous times since then, but experiencing this film for the first and second time was truly something else...Not everyone reacted to this movie on this level, of course, and it's possible that you will simply like this movie or even dislike it.

Or maybe JP just embodies perfectly the vision of the screenplay writer, and they're both equally good! I've seen it in something akin HDrip and enjoyed every moment of this movie and I await the Blu Ray release so I can enjoy it again, in more detail!The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you'd be too much of a child or too stupid for it, as it has the most substance a movie can have, by a fu*king continental drift from the lot!

If you like good cinema you will like this.""Joker"" stands as one of the most left wing films I have ever seen that persuasively validates left wing theory, which is funny because they are the ones attacking it without having seen it! Cancel culture is stupid isn't it?I felt the crushing weight and pressure of a cold society that did not care about the working class and that favored the elite. I saw a lonely human being kicked until he decided enough was enough and that resistance was not only the best way, but the only way forward.I never felt more revved up to ""fight the power"" and give the middle finger to a corrupt system than after seeing the Joker!The movie doesn't glorify shootings or vigilante justice so much as it makes it clear that if you take away options for people and treat them like they don't matter and don't exist then rebellion and riots WILL HAPPEN. It isn't so much a threat as an inevitability. People need to feel like the game isn't rigged against them to want to play.The way to fix society is to reach out to others more, to be more kind, and to fix the broken corrupt system that lacks humanity and only cares about money.The Joker is a hero for those who society deems garbage and worthless. In the movie there is a protester holding a sign that symbolizes modern-day society and it's connection to this movie perfectly: We are all clowns.",0

Brilliant storyline, outstanding direction and writing by Todd Philips, staggeringly suspenseful score, vivid cinematography and above all, Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing and sublime performance as the Joker. I was speechless with astonishment by the end of this film. To reiterate, Heath Ledger would've loved this masterpiece; I wish he was still alive today. Joaquin Phoenix's embodiment of an ordinary man who gradually transforms into Gotham's most mercurial, menacing, and diabolical criminal through his mentality and despair caused by rejection and humiliation from society was a central pillar of this film. In my experience, I was seeing Joker, not Joaquin Phoenix, for the entire movie through his erratic behavior, abnormal laughter, and irresistible dance moves. He has once again proven himself an extraordinary actor. The suspenseful score complements the dark theme as it strongly implies Arthur Fleck's imminent downfall.

Joker,Thought-Provoking Masterpiece!,"Joker is a drama movie in the vein of movies like Taxi-Driver and King of Comedy, It is a horror movie without any jump-scares or any other horror movie tropes and it is a comic-book origin movie about the most notorious and iconic villain. This movie will make you uncomfortable very often but ultimately it will force upon you some difficult questions that most movies shy away from asking. This is one of the few comic-book movies which will force you to think for hours after you have seen it.Joker is a movie about Arthur Fleck (played brilliantly by ""Joaquin Phoneix"") who had some psychopathic tendencies but due to deteriorating conditions of Gotham and certain events that took place in the span of the movie leads him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as Joker. The movie in its 2-hour runtime focuses completely on Arthur Fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well showcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. The main credit goes to Joaquin Phoneix for such brilliant acting definitely Oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may feel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the darkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. The rest of the supporting casts were great as well especially Robert De Niro.The movie is directed by Todd Philips who before this had only directed movies like Hangover and Due date. This movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could tell he is a big Scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver this movie is a bit of a slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially since this movie was a character study. As the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.The cinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating Gotham and characters. The soundtrack of the movie was also very good again I think it was very similar to Taxi Driver, It wasn't omnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.I am really glad that a movie like this exists. When comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these. Projects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. You may not end up liking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. Having said that I really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful cinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take.",0

If the patterning of these background details is mild and still interacts to a certain degree with the protagonist, then the most vivid social description in the film is highly rigid. The bottom group, with clowns as the cultural banner, was able to raise their arms in search of equality at first, but was later presented as the ""Wuhe people"" which is most easily understood in the patchwork.5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Arthur lives alone with his mother, Penny. After being fired from his job after a incident. Arthur learns that the world isn't his best friend. On the way home, 3 men attack Arthur, leading him to draw a gun and violently killing the men. This leads to a series of killing and revolts as the poverty-struck citizens try and give their message to kill the rich of Gotham.The movie was incredible and I strongly recommend this movie to anybody who loves movies and incredible acting.5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Should have won best picture,"This movie is a masterpiece. It literally shows how it feel to be depressed. We are following the perspective of Arthur Fleck (Joker) who is Batmans greatest villain in the comics. But in this movie we're actually rooting for him, and we're understand his choices.I think that this film has its bad reviews because it's not an typical American movie where it's a hero and a villain, and the hero wins in the end, and the villains is getting punished. Arthur is such a great anti-hero.5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Believe the Hype!!,"When i read people's reaction saying don't believe the hype or the character doesn't stay true to the comics, i would say that, those people are the ones that do not understand what this movie is trying to do.
This is not a comic book adaptation of the joker story, this is a story of a the downfall of a human being who falls into madness because of all the bad stuff that he experiences in his life while all he wants is to be accepted by society.
The story is well written and the acting of Joaquin phoenix is just out of this world, its that good.
To see an actor so determined to make his character believable for the adience is amazing and fascinating to watch and he deserves all the credit for his oscar winning performance.
For me this is a true masterpiece, one wich we don't see to often anymore.
If you expect to see a comic book, action loaded, super hero/villain movie then you will be dissapointed but if you on the other hand are interested in a psychological drama and want to know how a person can become so estranged from the normal world and turns into a character that despite him being totally imsane, you actually care and respect the him and understands why he does what he does then you are in for a treat because this is truly a mesmerising experience, that you will remember for a long time.
A true modern day masterpiece and an excellent milestone in movie makingA massive 10/10 for me",0
Joker,AN INSTANT CLASSIC & A MASTERPIECE OF CINEMA & A FILM I CAN TOTALLY RELATE TOO!!!,"WOW!!! ""JOKER"" what can be said that hasn't already?
It's an instant CLASSIC & a true masterpiece of cinema with one of the greatest performances in cinema history too from the incredible JOAQUIN PHOENIX & another great performance from the legendary Robert De Niro!!!
This movie i can relate to & i think lots of people will to, it's a powerful film & I've felt like how he feels & mental illness is an extremely hard thing to live with especially in a cold dark & nasty world like it is!!!!
A mesmerising movie!!!
The music was fantasticly moody & the cinematography was outstanding & captured the old fashioned gritty, grimy & crime infested & decaying Gotham city of 1981!!!
This Brilliant movie was part Psychological Drama & part Dark Crime Thriller, it was a mesmerising viewing & pretty much incredible in every single way!!!
I got vibes of old school greats such as Charles Bronson's 1974 Urban vigilante Thriller DEATH WISH, I also felt vibes from Martin Scorsese's 1976 Physiological Vigilante Thriller TAXI DRIVER & I'm sure there's other's that felt similar in look & story.
I felt ""Joker"" really did feel like a movie made in the 70's or very early 80's as that much care was MADE in the details & grimy urban tuxture of every location, i felt dirty just watching it & that's how well crafted & expertly made this Masterpiece was.Joaquin Phoenix is Phenomenal as Arthur Fleck the struggling Comedian with an extremely sad & horrific past, he also suffers really bad with his mental health & has a condition of severe laughter when nervous or upset, it's an astonishing performance a raw piece of acting on screen that is shocking & full of realism!!!
This movie felt real & feels like it can happen & has happened & will happen as it's darkness & themes are so relevant today...now!!!
I totally enjoyed this modern masterpiece & totally agree with all the huge praise this got & the awards it won. Truly OUTSTANDING piece of filmmaking that made me feel emotional & sorry for what Arthur has gone through in his terrible life but also how he goes isn't the best way but again it's totally understandable & i bet his actions will continue debate for years!!! A stone cold gritty Classic",0

Arthur became the Joker because somehow the society he lived in led him down that path, and we as a society and the way the system works do the exact same with millions of people.It made me question even myself and my ethics.Wonderful!5 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

It's Bellevue and St. Vincent's and The Pyramid Club and every seedy street corner from ""Law and Order SVU"" rolled into one.

Joker,A movie so unlike the movies of today. Truly a Masterpiece.,"This ain't no ordinary superhero movie. Never have I expected to tear up watching a movie especially in this day and age. The writing and character development is done extremely well, have I ever feel the pain The Joker goes through in this life. How his relation of his surroundings I compare to my relations with leftists elites like Silicon Valley and corrupt governments of western Europe to nihilists who infest the western world. That feel of wanting to change absolutely everything and how satisfying it would feel if you've actually achieve this stance of changing the landscape around you. Albeit my goals are a permanent renaissance, A permanent nirvana for the shreds of sanity of humanity, being the innocent ones, the ones unlike the ignorant normies and the scummy elitists who tear the world apart. Never have I expected a movie made in recent times have I ever felt shocked or uncomfortable in a good way. A movie to really inspire me especially at this magnitude is extremely hard to come across. Like The Matrix, it should really get you to grasp on an extremely interesting perspective of the world. A movie to really challenge you on what you perceive in life. This is one epic masterpiece if I've ever seen one.",0
Joker,Deeply disturbing and brutal,"This film is far removed from the comic book capers one would initially expect. There is no superhero action sequences here. This is a psychologically thrilling yet disturbingly shocking version of The Joker, maybe a character study if you will.There is no falling into chemical waste in this movie; what you get here isn't a physical destruction of the character but a mental one. This could be a film of The Joker's psyche rather than his story.Phoenix's portrayal is nothing short of amazing. At times I felt like he may have tried too hard, but regardless this is an award winning performance and it's clear that he has thrown everything into this character both mentally and physically.Coupled with a beautiful soundtrack and amazing photography and direction this is a true masterpiece.Personally I'd rate this as the best entrant into the Gotham City universe so far. To follow this going to be insanely difficult.A movie that is, at times, cringeworthy yet still keeps you mesmerised. This is a sickly sweet, brutal and deeply dark and disturbing film. There is no good versus evil here; there is only pure evil. This franchise has finally come of age.",0
Joker,Outstanding,"As an avid movie watcher, I can't help but get bothered by the amount of people comparing the jokers from the latest film to the one in Dark Knight. Let me first clear the fact that I think Heath Ledger's performance in the dark knight set the bar extremely high for anyone that was to play the role again, this was clear from the miserable attempt by Jared Leto in suicide squad.The joker in the latest instalment is about how he became the joker and the revelations of his childhood trauma and mental illness, it's the back story to everything you've ever seen about a joker. It is stupidly wrong for anyone to compare him to the Joker from the dark knight, where we see a matured chaotic version, a finished product more or less.This movie was not supposed to tell you a story with a begging middle and end, it doesn't have a very sold narrative nor it's supposed to be a fast paced watch. There's nothing wrong with that and I honestly don't think that's what they were going for. It portrays his existing struggle with his illness, his failed career aspirations and the harshness of the society he's in. The movie is about him and him only, the uprising of the joker everyone knew before this movie.If you're still bothered by the story then let the cinematography and sounds effects sink in for a moment.My final opinion is about the acting, it is one of the most original and convincing roles I've ever seen in a film, every move combined with his body language, tone and that horrific laughter captured my attention, which gave me goosebumpsIf Heath Ledger was alive today, he'd most certainly be proud of Joaquin's acting",0

So incredibly profound that I left the theater appreciating it more and more as I couldn't stop thinking about all the subtleties in the script and acting that made it perfect.

Joker,One of the greatest Masterpieces ever ?,"When I sat to watch the Joker , I was anxious because as a person I do not like comic book movies . It's just my taste . I really don't find those movies so important because most of the times , they do not transmit a message . However , my opinion changed when I viewed the Joker . Personally , I do not think that this movie is a comic book one . It is a drama that shows the tragic life of an ordinary individual , who is disregarded by the society around him . From a specific point of view , you feel sorry for him and you really want to blame the rich and powerful who have created a societal trap that helps them achieve their personal goals while ordinary people suffer every day . From another perspective however , you are scared and terrified by his reaction to all this misery that society brings to him . That's what this movie perfectly does . It creates a story that is split in two subjective realities . The distorted reality of Arthur Fleck that is influenced greatly by his mental illness and the reality through the eyes of the common people that blame his actions . It is a story that depends on how the viewer wants to see it . But I think that the story really shows the life of a man who did the wrong things and reacted in a psychopathic way to his problems , partly because of his mental illness and partly because of the pressure that was created by the environment around him . It is a story that does not justify this guy , but also does not accuse him . It just shows us that we , as a whole , sometimes create a Joker , without often realising it . So , for me it is a presentation of the two sides of the same story , those of an unstable and poor individual in a cruel dystopian city that does not care for people like him and those of the people with common sense . Additionally , it wants to tell people that they should take care of men and women who have mental problems and they should fight for a better world that does not treat the unprivileged so harshly as it does .",0

Joker,Brilliant,"Simply awesome.By no means a super hero or super villain type of movie. This chronicles one mans decent into insanity. It is grim, relentless, sad and utterly compelling. A damming indictment on how mental health issues are dealt with. Dismissed, mocked or simply ignored.In this story we are shown what happens when such an individual, finally, screams enough is enough. Down trotten, rejected by society and held up to endless ridicule, the Joker when he finally emerges is simply terrifying. His very public outing will go down in cinema history as it is memorising, disturbing and truly believable.There is talk of Oscars for this performance and it is absolutely merited, Joaquin Phoenix simply nailed this part. This is not a popcorn, switch off the brain and watch the action movie. It takes the viewer into the darkest, most distressing thing there is, our own mind.Brilliant movie.",0
Joker,What a remarkable insight into those who suffer from mental illness.,"This movie was sensational.
The actors, the cinematography and most importantly the insight into mental illness and it's victims.
There is such a stigma towards mental illness and watching this movie really highlights some of the reasons that an individual may develop a mental illness, and how someone's childhood and upbringing can effect mental health throughout there entire life.
The joker had serious trauma throughout his childhood, and it came to surface in adult hood as you can see in the movie.
The build up of the movie from start to finish was very intense and overwhelming.
It highlights the stigma people can have towards mental illness and should be an eye opener for those who are too quick to judge people.
Sensational movie. I would recommend this to anybody. Huge thumbs up.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,This movie is no Joke,"Thinking to Joker it is a haunting, beautiful film that shines in it's brutality. Not in terms of the violence, but more along the lines of witnessing one man's journey into madness. Each event, each action provides a great amount of weight along with an unease factor.Joaquin Phoenix's performance was phenomenal and you can feel the heartbreak along with the mental strain that continously pushes him into a dark mind set.The grittier nature of Gotham, combined with the beautiful score really help sets the mood, and the songs from Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante adds whole another of class in midst of the slums.

Cinematography, acting, story, character progression, comedic tones... All perfect.A good watch, highly recommended it. I don't know who is paying these critics to write such BS reviews. You're not original when you rate a good movie badly. We all know you are just doing it for attention/clicks/fame.

Joker,An amazing collaboration- Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really done it!,"This was the first DC movie that I actually paid attention to and paid money to see. I did go into the cinema with high expectations after watching the teaser for the film. Already, Joaquin Phoenix had astonished me with his talent. It was within the first 10 minutes of the movie that had captured me.It is clear that writer, producer and director Todd Phillips should be credited for this as he kept the audience hooked from the beginning till the end.The way in which Arthur Fleck's life was portrayed was truly amazing storytelling and really took the audience to new lengths in explaining his real life story. Interestingly, Todd Phillips uses the struggling society and city of Gotham to reflect the physical and mental state of Arthur. In doing so, he explained contemporary anxieties and how society's actions impact our lives in terms of behaviour and how it makes us who we really are.From a young age, we are taught that there are heroes and villains. We are always told that the hero needs to defeat the villain and shouldn't be questioned because it is for the ""greater good"". However, we never really stopped to think why it is we have heroes and why we have villains in this world. Instead, we're immediately taught that villains correspond to being evil- that a villain should be punished by a hero. However, after watching the life story of Arthur fleck, is it actually correct to call him a ""villain""?Should someone who has been so badly treated by a toxic society be labelled as a villain? Isn't it true of nature for someone to cry when they are upset? To laugh when told a joke? Actions do have consequences. This is simply the same way it is for Arthur fleck to criticise his society for kicking him when he was down- for pushing him away when he wanted him- for refusing to put on a happy face when all he wanted to do was to be truly happy when society didn't let him.So yes, Arthur may have done some things that make him fall under the category of a ""villain"", but who is the true villain?- him or society?After continuously being beat down and trampled on by society, Arthur fleck began consultation where he would receive medication and ""support"" from a therapist. In this way, it could be said that the medication Arthur was given, may have made his condition worse eg: depression/ anxiety. Aside from this, Arthur had a therapist who would simply ""read lines from a script"" instead of listening and actually helping him. This is part of the major issue in society whereby the people who are vulnerable and needy are pushed away by those who have power, even if it is only a little bit. People like Arthur are neither seen, nor heard and the only time they will be - when they do something that goes against the ""rules of society"" because ""putting on a happy face"" doesn't work for everyone.As the film progresses, Arthur is taken off the very little support he will have been given and stripped from his job. With nothing left, Arthur began hallucinating and suffering from psychosis- believing that things were real when they actually weren't- developing negative thoughts. All he has is ""negative thoughts"".Moving onto the acting in this movie...Joaquin Phoenix as the lead role was a brilliant decision made by Todd Phillips and other casting directors. It is vital that that a role such as JOKER should be played correctly, without a single fault- especially after Heath ledger's Oscar winning performance. Joaquin was nothing short of excellent. Utter perfection. Not a single fault in his acting. From breaking out into laughter to playing an emotionally and mentally wrecked character- Phoenix mastered it all. An Oscar Win is essential and exactly what he deserves. Every moment, every word spoken and every frame that was shot was done to perfection.By Saniya Khan

Joker,For those who gave out score under 10,"This is not a normal superhero movie where you will expect glamorous CG. But it definitely gives you more thrill and excitement than the other superhero movie. A smile, a bully, a setback, a betray, a misunderstanding, a confusion, a lie, a chance, these are what life makes of. Anyone who gave out score lower than 9 repeatedly reported the lack of excitement from the movie, that's because you guys are lack of life experience to feel so.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Unbelievably perfect,"Very rarely now it seems does a movie even leave you feeling like it was a worthwhile investment of your time. More often now films are regurgitated storylines, reboots, or an attempt at something new that feels like it shouldn't have been done. Even more rare now is a movie that leaves an impact on you long after you see it. Joker is just that.Granted there is a lot of hype with this movie and an equal number of ""professional"" critics who clearly think it's cooler for them to say this is a terrible movie so that it makes them feel elite over the common moviegoers. With that said, this movie is absolutely perfect and how anyone cannot say that after seeing it clearly doesn't have what it takes to appreciate such raw talent of acting, writing, direction, cinematography, and music.The entire film feels so intentionally and intensely dark, awkward and real that it make you feel the sanity slipping from Arthur's grasp. Phoenix's acting challenges that of even Ledger's Joker and does so through mastering the smallest physical gestures and expressions that make the character feel more real than ever. From the way he runs, dances, stares and smiles it feels 100% authentically Joker.The movie does a great job incorporating elements of the Batman series that fans will enjoy but makes this a completely stand alone movie. For anyone worried that they might not get it because they don't follow Batman, no worries, you won't be disappointed. The storyline does a fantastic job of ""producing"" the Joker, giving him slow building reason behind the madness that feel authentic rather than corny. The incorporation of Pseudobulbar Affect disorder, and even the way it's initially presented and the character's ongoing struggle with it throughout, to explain for and add the maniacal laughter is genius. The childhood trama mixed with current personal and social issues with a desire to fit in makes for compelling reasons to believe this is happening rather than a supervillain being born from being picked on.The entire movie is dark. And that's an understatement. Like Requiem for a Dream level dark. And the story feels like Taxi Driver, V for Vendetta, and American Psycho crammed together inside a Dark Knight costume. All of this is done completely right in every aspect from lighting and angles, to interesting intermittent scenes to add more to the development of the story and character, to perfect camera angles, shots and editing, to intense and properly chosen music. I guess my only criticism is the casting of De Niro. Let's face it, he's not a good actor and we're all just kinda going along with him because he's ""one of the greats"". Earlier in his career and in some roles sure. But not now and not as a funny late night talk show host. But... it's not terrible and they make it work but better casting could have been done rather than relying on a big name.This movie is one that will go down for me as one of the best I've ever seen. I left the theater wanting to buy another ticket and go back in to make the experience last. Very few movies now make you feel something. Even fewer do it this well.",0

Joker,People Severely Missunderstand What This Movie Is About,"Joker is a film about a man's transformation from the mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck to the widely-known villain Joker. This seems straightforward enough, but there are much deeper messages in this movie that apply not just to this fictional universe, but to our real world.
Arthur is a man who has been beaten down by not just society but fate itself time and time again. He has been dealt, for lack of a better term, a s*** hand and no one in his life seems to truly want to help him. He is a man that truly is alone in society, learning throughout the film how true that statement really is.
While the actions committed by him are definitely wrong, we understand him and can even somewhat empathize with him (hopefully we can, I may just be weird). Unlike how some people like to suggest, this movie doesn't glorify the violence that Arthur causes. This movie shows how horrible people can be created by the environment they are living in. We are living in a time where we like to blame the violence around us on the insane people who start it. Shootings are happening more than ever, and the insane gunman is responsible for it.
Of course, it cannot be denied that the gunman is at fault. There is clearly something wrong with the people who do these things. However, much too few people think, ""Why is this happening?"", ""Why are these people doing the things they do, and how can we stop them from doing this?"" We see the result of what happens when an at risk individual doesn't get the help he needs in this movie. What we need is a system that can actually help these people.
The movie Joker differs from other comic book movies because it is not only grounded in reality, but it's messages can be directly applied to our world. People like Arthur Fleck, people who have been brutally beaten by life at every turn need a way to be helped. The rich and successful don't care about these people. These people are viewed as threats instead of who they really are: humans, just like everyone else. We need to create an outlet where these individuals can get the actual support they need, not stuff them with medication and let specialists with their own agendas pretend to care about them.
Another argument I've seen about this movie is that it has no reason for existing. It shows violence and shows a unique portrayal of a popular character but it has no substance to it. As you can probably tell, I strongly disagree with anyone who believes this, and I truly believe anyone who thinks this completely missed the point of the entire movie.
In conclusion, this movie definitely has substance and doesn't glorify violence in the slightest. This movie brings up an issue in our society that we have been neglecting for far too long. There's a stigma about mentally ill people that we have to get over. People who have been neglected and have nothing left to lose are the most dangerous type of people, and the problem with our society is that we allow people to feel as if they have nothing left to lose. Arthur Fleck is just a person who never got any sign at all that he was needed or loved by society, or anyone for that matter. He is truly, as cliche as this may sound, a product of his environment. You can criticize this movie for being too dark but by doing so you're just dismissing the reality we live in.",0

Joker,"Best comic book inspired movie, ever","The depth to which Joaquin Pheonix plays Joker is actually disturbing. This Joker is so very different than the gold standard Heath Ledger. In Heath's Joker, we feel unpredictable and scared or terrified, but Joaquin potrays a Joker which isn't as terrifying but it's downright eerie, disturbing and unnerving. It makes you sympathize with Joker, the most despicable character in comic universe, and makes you wanna help him. It doesn't make you justify Joker's choices but it will make you understand them, and by the end you will want to justify Arthur's actions, not Joker's but Arthur's. You wouldn't be able to justify them but you will have a hard time to condemn them. Also the story leaves you at an uncertain point open to any interpretation, just like the charachter and the comics it has drew inspiration from. It is a mind boggling, thorough, disturbing and unnerving charachter study that makes you question not only society but yourself too.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Perfection.,"Watching this film was fantastic, you were so immersed in it and everything that happend had some real impact, to some even, relatable problems. The music was fantastic, the atmosphere was good and the way Arthur tries to be positive and find solace and happiness, everything is only made worse by lies, no help, no friends no nothing.The reason for why for me it is a 10/10 is because i've been in a similar situation before, no friends, don't know how to get help or what to do. Sometimes these simple problems cause the worst of epidemics, ex: violence, mass shootings, suicides and so on.This movie is pretty much a fantastic depiction of mental illness and ""society"".

Joker,"What do you get when you cross a brilliant actor, a meaningful movie and the best supervillain in comics?","The feelings that this movie brings on you are really hard to describe, and it takes a while to swallow completely. Its dark and enters in morality and realistic topics, criticizing the way that society works, how most people see the mental illness and how an economic crisis can afect someone. Joker isn't a monster without feelings, he is a creation of a broken world, a broken Gotham City.
The most amazing part of the film is that they put you in the mind of Arthur Fleck, in a lot of scenes which there is a conflict between Humor, Tension and Fear. Out of nowhere you find yourself and others laughing at a terrible scene, just like the Joker would, and there is nothing you can do about it.
The development of the protagonist is well distributed and it works. His laughs which were once impulsive and uncontrolled turns into a coordenated and at the same time chaotic aspect of the personality of Arthur. I really think that Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job and deserve at least an indication to the Oscars, being pessimistic.And answering the title of the review:
I tell you what you get, you get the best movie of comics ever made!",0

Joker,The start of something very special indeed...,Possibly the best comic book character depiction ever put into film. You feel the transition coming through every scene in the film and the wait is amazingly worth it when the joker finally arrives. The scene on the steps when he's become the joker was spine tingling because you realise this really is the Joker that your watching in the flesh. If this is the only version of Phoenix as the joker I'll have to accept it but if they can replicate this quality into a sequel it will be spectacular.

Joker,For the first time ever I will be returning to cinema to watch this again,"I admit it. I did not expect much from this film. But my god It was a nice surprise! Positives is by far the transformation of joker from start of the film to the end. It's incredibly dark and probably too distressing for some people to watch. The violence happens now and then but each time makes a huge impact! The negatives are obvious the main one being of course the late heath ledger, he left quite a high bar to jump! I personally believe phoenix matches him and does jump that bar. People just need to realise this is a different actors approach and different take on a character from a different universe. The second negative is the one that got to me the most. I personally believe part of jokers charm is no one has a clue who he is where he's come from or how he got them scars. I did eventually accept the origin story of course and I ask other hardcore comic book fans to do the same. As once you pass this hurdle this does become one of the best films ever. I will be returning to the cinema to watch this again which Is a first for me.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Simply brilliant,"I would like to start this review by pointing out the fact that everything in this movie is just amazing, from the cast & crew members to the acting and to the story itself. Many people believed that this would just be another Marvel-like movie, but it was nothing like that. Todd did an excellent job in telling this character's story in such a unique way that it makes you want more. The way that he told the story of this worldwide known character is something amazing. The cinematography itself was simply astonishing. Troughout the movie there were some amazing shots that just took your breath away.
Joaquin's acting in this picture was just out of this world. The way that he portraied Joker's character was something to learn from. He put his whole heart in this particular role and you could easily see it while watching the movie. He made you fall in love with the character, although he is a villain. Even the dancing scenes took my breath away as he did such an amazing job in this area too. He truly deserves an Oscar for this outstanding performance.
I truly believe that this is one of the best character studies there ever were. It is one of those movies that make you want to see it again and again without getting bored of it. It makes you want more. Todd made such a good job by bringing awareness to mental health issues
to the world and although this movie has its range of bad reviews, it still makes you understand how the society truly works these days.
To conclude, this is and exceptional movie and i totally recommend it with all my heart. You will not regret it!",0

Joker,The best Joker origin film.. ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,"A well crafted film with a more realistic approach on the comic book villain joker. The movie takes everyone to the 80's environment with the amazing cinematography, costumes and set design. Joaquin Phoenix is the only actor who could perform this iteration of Joker to the perfection. The movie is great and will be a cult film because it took a realistic approach by showcasing who Arthur Fleck is, and what makes him to be the joker. There aren't many action scene which is a great choice and in the few fight scenes which the movie has depicts how vulnerable is Arthur. The Nolan's Trilogy was a huge success and loved among the fans till date because it had a similar approach by making a batman film in a more realistic and a believable tone by making him more vulnerable to punches, guns, knives, dogs[;)] instead of making him more pumped up with too many gadgets, armor and fighting against the unbelievably strong godlike villains with his infinite stamina, health and never ending supply of his gadgets. The more grounded approach made the audience feel connected with Nolan's Trilogy. This film also follows in those footsteps and had achieved it perfectly. Todd Phillips with his direction and Joaquin Phoenix with his acting, together they have crafted a masterpiece.",0
Joker,Over the top!,"People are already familiar with superhero movie genres (like MCU) - state-of-the-art special effects, top-notch action, eye-catching action, clear good and evil, usually divided into two lines of good and bad characters fight with each other. Joker appears as a new breeze, the film with dark colors, heavy psychology, multiple meanings. The film also has a villain, but it seems that besides Joker, all the remaining characters are villains, he alone with his desire, with his soul and body have been trampled to the extreme against whole ""world"". The majority of moviegoers are young people, including those who once loved the Joker of The Dark Knight. The Joker in TDK is much more crazy from thinking to acting out through action. He lives for his IDEAL, making Harley Quinn crazy with him. Joaquin's Joker is also crazy but crazy in a more life-like manner, with more psychological changes, making the audience think more. And so among the heads who have seen Endgame, there are some who have not felt the Joker, have not been familiar with such a heavy psychological drama after days of watching and waiting for the super products blockbusters, romance movies, live - action movies and horror movies. And although I disagree with Martin Scorsese's opinion that ""Marvel movies are not movies"", I understand he has his reasons for saying so. Please review Joker a few more times to feel the full meaning of the movie, I myself could not understand all the messages that the film sent, so I will definitely have to watch it again. I am waiting for analyzing and explaining the cut scenes in Vietnam. But please don't say that Joker is ""bored"", ""sleepy"", ""not as good as Joker in TDK"", ... something like that. Because it's not natural that Joker is so appreciated. üòâ",0

Not only does he understand the complicated character but he makes it his own. Something very dificult considering the iconic performances of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,'JOKER' made me fall in love with the Cinema once again....,"I was so excited for this movie ever since it was announced. And today I finally watched it. I travelled around 100 kms just to watch this movie. Because I just don't want to miss this one. And ofcourse I loved the movie. It's once in a lifetime movie. It is Dark, disturbing, intense. Yet undeniably a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix without any doubt is a real gem of the cinema. This one is not for people who like typical commercial movies and who don't like dark, intense and violent theme.
Robert de Niro's role was short but he did a great job as expected. The movie keeps getting dark. I loved the pace, direction & cinematography. And the BGM is just fantabulous. From the moment when he puts a smile on his face with blood shows that Arthur Fleck is dead now and The Clown Prince of Crime is born. From that moment, He is no longer just a shadow, he's the light of those people to stand up against the oppressors of Gotham. Truly, I feel so overwhelmed by watching this movie. Loved it.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Blow Expectations Out of the Water.,"Review:
'Joker' is an American psychological-thriller film directed by Todd Phillips. Being one of my most anticipated movies of the year as well as a movie I never wanted to be made, I was feeling so many different emotions on my way to the theatre to see this film. I needed time to think about it and process what I had just seen because the movie is very dark and heavy, and after doing so I believe this is my favorite film to come out of 2019.
The movie follows the character of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is working as a clown-for-hire while living with and caring for his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City. We see Arthur get beaten down by society both literally and figuratively, from being jumped in an alley to being fired from his job and being called crazy and useless. Slowly over time, he starts thinking his life is a comedy and transforms into the clown he has been portraying for years.
If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal in this movie I will be both surprised and disappointed. What he did to prepare for this role was incredible and he brought everything to every scene he was in. Everybody in this movie fit their roles perfectly, but other than Joaquin Phoenix another standout performance for me has to be Robert De Niro. He wasn't in the film a whole lot, but I really believed he could have been a Talk-Show Host. He didn't phone it in at all and really committed which I appreciated.
I really can't talk about what I liked in this movie without going into spoiler territory. However, I will say that the movie needed to be Rated-R and I'm so happy Todd Phillips pushed the Studio into letting that happen. There were certain scenes that I could tell if they tried to do the same thing in a PG-13 film, it wouldn't have worked. They were also very smart in showing Arthur slowly progress into the Joker we know and it didn't just all happen at once, he hated his life in the beginning and dragged his feet when he walked, and by the end he is carrying himself with confidence.
Overall, I really can't say a lot about this movie beside I loved it! I beg for everybody to go and see this movie in theatres, movies like this deserve to make money so original films like this can be made. Yes, even though this is based off a 'Batman' character, it is still a very original story and I highly recommend.

Joker,Unbelievably good.. so much better than I expected!,"I've just got back from the cinema and I'm still in complete shock how incredible this film is. The acting from Joaquin moved me in parts and felt uncomfortable but incredibly gripping at the same time, just amazing. I've never felt this way from any of the previous related films, but this one is very different. You truly feel empathy for Arthur even though he has none himself and this film not only helps to put the whole backstory into perspective in a way that's never been imagined before, but also truly unique and intense while retaining moments of dark humour even in some of the most depraved scenes. Absolute masterpiece!8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A chilling masterpiece,"Joaquin Phoenix is utterly phenomenal portraying the birth of Gotham's greatest villain, the Joker.
This is a story of man slowly losing faith in humanity to the point of madness. We get to know the Joker first as Arthur Fleck; a sad loner who isn't well liked because he makes people uncomfortable. He doesn't have friends, or a special someone in his life, only his mother who he still lives with and cares for. Arthur does the best that he can, working hard as a party clown but he is down on his luck and the world he lives in is brutal. On top of that his dream of becoming a comedian is shattered when talk show host Murray Franklin shows a clip of Arthur bombing at a comedy club. Meanwhile tension in Gotham has been mounting as the poor have been suffering and they turn their anger towards the rich, who seem completely indifferent to the struggles of those living in poverty. It's the perfect recipe for disaster and chaos.
This haunting tale is definitely a must-see!8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Joker is vary good,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Joker is the pinnacle of comic book film,"Now that the Joker has had a couple of legitimate outings, I think it's clear to say that Joker may be that best outing. I know that Heath Ledger is known to have the best performance, but wow does Phoenix deserve an Oscar. His character goes through such a terrifying and disturbing character arc that you don't want to see, yet can't look away. All the performances are sensational (including a couple of twists) and a brilliant ending to wrap everything together. The score matches it clearly, taking that ""Joker"" persona very clearly. I can't think of anybody that can match what this character may be. If Phoenix wins an Oscar, then this means that the Joker is one of the most complex and interesting character ever in film. All in all, Joker makes the viewer believe that everything he does is okay (but it's clearly not) and keeps you on the edge of your seat through brilliant direction and a sensational character study.8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Best movie of the year so far,"Phoenix gives an absolutely phenomenal performance as the joker, in my opinion the best that has ever been put to screen. The story goes places you would never expect it to and plays around with the Batman/Gotham city lore/characters in interesting ways.My only slight problem is that I think it takes a little too much inspiration from taxi driver, and that a certain character feels wasted or unimportant but they're not in it for that much anyway8 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

I want to smile as the directing and acting is flawless. You believe every scene and quite frankly you would be an a****** to try and pick holes in it.
The crying is how at the centre of it, Arthur actually has a good heart, but was screwed over by society, work and family.

Joker,A perfect comic character based film - JOKER_2019,"***_NO_SPOILERS_***Finally a DC movie savagely walked n sat on the Masterpiece Shelve beside ""Dark Knight trilogy"". First I thought, It would have been great if Martin Scorsese directed this film when it was announced long back, but #Todd_phillips proved he is a master in carving this Art-Emotional-Crime-SuperVillain-Drama , a little slow.. but not for me , So Deep, Dark & Psychological tale for the origin of The JOKER , Todd Phillips's previous Comedy-dramas have gave him so much experience & insight to deal this psychic comedian, and he used it perfectly.Cinematography, lighting, Set works, Editing have perfectly delivered us Retro style of Gotham city.Joaquin Phoenix is the best JOKER till date as same as Heath ledger. But if I must say who is the 1st best... it's ""Phoenix"" of course for me, hands down !! Because he showed us shades of sanity to Insanity . A full length character study throughout the duration of the film.Robert De Niro , what to say about him ? , Top notch performance as Murray.that vintage stage-dramatic music is so engaging & apt to every scene accordingly.-Over all it is one of the greatest comic based films .Phoenix deserves best actor academy award.#NOTE : This film is not like other DC/Marvel comics based films , not even a bit, far less popcorn entertainer than ""dark Knight trilogy""... No money heists, no major chase sequences, no blasts & shootouts , no big action sequences, ...It's something like the this decade's Taxi driver (1976), The King of comedy (1982) & Man on the moon (1999). If you are only into that above entertainer kinda stuff & doesn't like little slow art type films, then better stay away from this .",0

From start to end this movie just cannot stop. You will laugh, you will get shocked, you will even cry. This is the best character study I have seen since Taxi Driver. Simply, magnificent.

Joker,A Cinematic Masterpiece,"Todd Phillips created a solo Joker film and made it rated R. When I first saw the trailer, I actually hated it. I was expecting brutal violence and I wanted to see the Joker go full crazy. I changed my mind when I heard the reviews and I went to the theater the next day.I came out amazed. Joaquin Phoenix shatters this role effortlessly, and his performance was some of the best I have seen in years. Robert de Nero, a great actor too, does his part as Murray Franklin and is actually pretty likable. The score is haunting, mesmerizing, and kind of beautiful. This is the first movie that actually made me give a damn about the score in a film.This film needed to be made, and people out there need to see it. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and I'm not afraid to admit I have seen the movie twice in theaters, and even more at home. I truly enjoy this film and I truly recommend it.",0

No other crime film has given me such goosebumps that Joker has given me. And no other film ever will. I don't care what wannabe movie critics like Peter Bradshaw say about this film, because they're wrong and sold out.This movie tackles the degeneracy of our society in such a bold manner that it leaves people shocked. If I had to explain someone about dark humor with a movie, I'd suggest them this. And as a cherry on top, this was a very low budget film. Instead of the usual circus party CGI graphics we see from the cinematic universe of comic films, this movie uses traditional tricks like powerful color grading and what not.I vehemently stand against anyone who thinks this movie is anything short of a masterpiece.

When movies like Fight Club, Seven, The Silence of The Lambs, Green Mile, Gladiator, Memento and many many more movies were being released.Joaquin deserved this Oscar with an outstanding performance.

Joker,The Best JOKER,"The best DC in history. The best Joker in history. It's the most original comic joker. The joker portrayed by Phoenix performs extremely well, whether they can't restrain the pain under the laughter, the inner struggle behind the wry smile, or they want to laugh, but they have to pretend they can't laugh. All of them are telling the story of this terrible life step by steps. At the beginning of the film, the story of the ancient times is slowly pushed forward, and a series of attacks are completely out of control and outbreak after knowing the truth of his mother. This is the real track that happens to every bottom people in the society. Almost all of them choose compromise and tolerance. So there is only one Joker in the world.

""Joker"" is not a so fictional character. Unfortunately, there are plenty of joker's out there who were mistreated, neglected, and abused, by factual inferior human beings, that have gone free without there well-deserved punishment. This union of talent and capacity forces of Todd Philips and Joaquim Phoenix just had realism into the story. Plus, from a neurologic point of view, it showed us how a sociopath is made. Particularly, how the pain and suffer that leads to depression and pos-traumatic stress disorder, can change the brain chemical balance, the reality perspective, and, ultimately, the personality; transforming us into a confident, fearless, courageous, and vengeful human creature, but still with a sense of justice. It's also a positive point of this movie conception, that the introduction of the ""Batman"" story was very well determined and written.

Joker,"About Joker, Batman and us","When Batman made his debut the year was 1939. In Europe, the nazism was offering a solution to poverty: the chosen and pure ones have to take the lead to organize a better life. This fascist thing was also in the air after the communism had shown its contradictions and violence. With the victory in the II World War liberal democratic countries had to propose a new version of capitalism. This human version, the Welfare State, went through more or less till the 70's when the neoliberalism arrived in the political scene advocating cuts in social expenditures and state shrinking. In a way, Batman and Joker were created from the same ground of despair and hope in the mid of the last century. We are now in 2019. The welfare state capitalism is in the hospital badly wounded. The evil may be explained by a real troubled life of the Joker maybe not. As Joker realizes his potency after every crime perpetrated by him, the young batman must accomplish a double task in the future: to turn Gothan city a livable place for all and to dismantle the joker's way of the necessary use of violence by the dispossessed. If Batman fails in this noble tale, the fascism will come again to organize the jokers promising a better life. Great Film!",0

Joker,"A movie that borders on genius-repellant, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable.","Phoenix deserves all the glory that he is receiving for this role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside his usual comedy films. Joker is insane and utterly unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, it has paid off. A darker DCEU was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of idea's. Joker is interesting and thought provoking, something the MCU can only dream about. The Black Panther is not the Joker by any means, so expect to see this sitting at the Oscars. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratch Catcher be introduced in the future films?

Joker,One of the best movies I've seen,"This movie focuses on mental health issues, and how it can affect someone in a very negative way, which is why it's so great.

Joker,Masterpiece ... Worth The Hype ü§°,My first ever review on IMDB and it's worth it .. The amazing Joaquin Phoenix had a difficult task on this role(Joker) as we will always gonna compare him to Heath Ledger and everyone who played the role before.The outstanding acting and the mood that Phoenix's is going to take you through is just phenomenal. Yes the movie was inspired by Scorsese's Taxi Driver however the joker has his own and unique act.I guarantee you won't feel the 2hrs of the movie GO AND WATCH IT ..!!3 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0

Joker,"If the Joker has an origin story, let it be this!","Part of the mystique of the Joker is that his past is a mystery obfuscated by mockery and, like all good jokes, never needs explaining.

Joker,Finally Frank Miller should be happy - and proud!,"Never thought Phoenix could beat Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, but Phoenix did the impossible - and there's no doubt - this movie is a 10/10.
After watching the film I was thinking that now I had just watched my very first superhero (ok, supervillain then) movie. Frank Miller would be proud - I hope, because this is the first movie from DC where I felt the atmosphere and story matched or transcended the best books. Ledger might still have delivered the best comic book Joker performance, but Phoenix just went beyond the books and made the Joker come out the books and made him into a real person. Like for the first time turning Pinocchio into a real boy ;-)I do think there might be an age problem though, unless we're going to see Batman beating up the elderly in later movies, but maybe some clever writer can fix that, lol.Note that Joker isn't for kids including young teenagers, not really because of violence, but this is a movie for adults. It's not funny nor is it an action movie, mostly I think - like Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns books - this is a film about society - a political film about wealth inequality and the consequences. A movie cleverly disguising and reflecting our current world. To quote the movie Seven:""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.""and the Joker hits you with a sledgehammer like never before. You could say it's also a movie about the nature of being evil. - In psychology the term does not really exist, because being evil can be reduced to many different components, so is the Joker really evil - or sick - or a product of society - or everything combined (=sum of traumatic incidents and triggers)? That - together with Phoenix' godlike performance - make this movie a 10/10.BTW, saw the 4K disc version on a 85"" high-end Sony TV. The 4K version is reference when it comes to 4K image quality, maybe topped only by Mortal Engines. Blacks are really blacks due to HDR and the resolution is so high it feels like swinging a microscope over Phoenix face from time to time. I could even clearly see the dirt under his bitten fingernails - which was kinda gross. Also his dirty teeth, and every skin imperfection, all his hair etc. This movie was so disturbingly clear I was thinking that maybe the more blurry blu-ray version would be better, lol - but the clarity did add presence like (close to) never before. Felt like watching a stream of photographs. There's a small amount of film grain used, but you don't notice it in most scenes.Sound and music were awesome too, and the 4K disc contains Dolby Atmos sound as usual - in fact the music may be another reason for buying the 4K disc version - Joker got a second Oscar for the music.",0
Joker,WhySoSerious!!!,"There is an African proverb that says ""The child who is not embraced by the village will someday burn the whole village down to feel its warmth"".
This gem from the DC world has shown it how.
""Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.""
This eternal struggle has taken the form of Joaquin's Joker, unearthing the hidden wounds of the society.
He had comically noted down ""I just hope my death make more cents (sense) than my life""
Joker itself is a living statement on this apathetic society and paves way for need of the Batman..

Joker,Isn't It Rich?!...,"JOKER is astounding and confrontational. It covers issues like mental illness, class warfare, guns, societal breakdown, etc., while presenting a ""villain"" in Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is as sympathetic as he is terrifying. Filled w/ uncomfortable, even shocking moments, as well as unsettling comedic elements, some scenes will make many viewers squirm! Arthur is the overlooked, dismissed ""nobody"", forced to believe he doesn't even exist. He's a man in desperate need of help. Unfortunately, Gotham city isn't the place to find it. As his mind begins to shatter, Arthur has no idea what's coming his way. He simply finds his strength in a sudden act of violence, and somehow taps into the void within those around him, ultimately becoming a sort of messiah. The mesmerizing Mr. Phoenix uses his body as much as his dialogue to bring both Arthur and his alter ego to life. This is a movie to be watched and taken seriously, in spite of its comic book origins. It's as much a serious statement as it is entertainment. Multiple viewings recommended...4 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,...you wouldn't get it.,"It has been quite awhile since I have seen a movie in cinemas that is absolutely horrifying, thought-provoking, and could be considered an overall great film. JOKER kicks the door down and takes all of these accolades, as well as multiple Oscars hostage, with no Batman, or films of this caliber in sight to stop it.
Enter the gritty, decrepit, and timeless city of Gotham, where the rich keep getting richer, the poor keep getting poorer, and violence is at an all-time high.
""Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"" asks Arthur Fleck, our central character played by Joaquin Phoenix. He lives in a small apartment with his aging mother, who reassures him that he was meant to ""bring joy and laughter to the world"" as he pursues a career in stand-up comedy.
You will not be waiting long to see this man's downward spiral begin, as his poor living conditions and mental illnesses are on full display, to devastating effect for the audience. Couple that with rampant crime, corrupt politicians, and the overall hatefulness of Gotham, and we begin to see the twisted, pained grin of the greatest comic-book villain of all time form on this seemingly kind-hearted man's face.
""They don't give a $#&% about people like you Arthur"", his psychiatrist tells him as she reveals that due to budget cuts, he will no longer receive his medication he so desperately needs. Scenes like this provide a constant tension, as the audience have some idea going in as to what we can expect from the title alone.
You will be right alongside him for the ride as his life and mental health deteriorate to the point that neither he, nor we, can decipher who to trust, what's real anymore, or if we even exist at all. Are his recollections accurate? What is wrong and what is right? Where is the line between justice and vengeance? It is these questions that are the strengths of JOKER, and where it truly shines.
By the time the credits roll, you will be left with these questions, but also answers that are beautifully weaved into the classic storyline by director Todd Phillips. Most important though, you will have a comic-book movie that steps outside the norm to remind you that sometimes the most diabolical villains are created, maybe by you...
The final punchline of JOKER is a solid 10/10.
""Goodnight, and always remember... that's life!""",0
Joker,A must watch for everyone,"Ok I know I am late on this one....I waited till Joker came out on digital because I wanted to watch it without distractions. In reference to the job I do, I know the impact of mental illness plays in today's society. It is disheartening to see that people with serious and true mental health issues are shuffled in a system that over burdened and under funded. This does not include addicts and malingeres.I greatly appreciate this movie because it shows the spiraling decent of a man that needed serious attention. It shows the impact that abuse and domestic violence causes on the mind. This movie was panned by critics that couldn't wrap their simple minds that these issues in the mental health system, leave those who truly need help lost and tied to red tape.People need see past the comic book lore we have grown to know and see that this movie is a story on today's society and the violence that one untreated can cause.Look past whether or not Jaquine Pheonix deserves an oscar (which he truly does besides the point) and see that we need to take better care of those in our country that need help. We need hold the value of every life in highest regard and hold the oppressive bureaucracy accountable.This movie not just a work of art, it is a dissertation of the world today. Watch it and learn from it. It needs to be known that one man can cause chaos that affects the world. Every actor that has played the Joker has put there own spin on it. Romero was the maniac, Nicholson was the Narcissist, Ledger was the fanatic, and Pheonix is the reflection. He portrayed the most real and poignant Joker today. Hollywood take notes, people need a dose of reality sometimes and this movie delivered it.",0
Joker,Absolutely Brilliant example of the mind,"Joker is a powerful social critique of our perception towards mental health (how would we react if someone started laughing uncontrollably in the street?), but it can also be seen as an absurdist perspective on free will. Arthur's fatal flaw is not the hubris of Odysseus, or the ambition like Macbeth, but the simple and relatable need to discover why he was born, and for others to notice his existence. He achieves both of these things in the film, but the symbolic death of ""Arthur"" with the killing of his mother and rebirth of the comedic ""Joker"", occurs from a catalytic reaction with society, rather than as an agent of his own destiny.In philosophy, ""the Absurd"" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe. In the film, this conflict reaches its culmination when Arthur embraces his involuntary laughter as his real self, and finally understands the ""joke"". Life itself. It's a joke for absurdists. As he says in the film, comedy is subjective.When he accepts who he is, he is finally seen by others, and becomes a symbol of chaos and anarchy in a grotesque parody of the superhero. But crucially, this is not something he chooses to become, it's something he is forced into becoming because of his genetics, his environment, and his mother. Arthur ultimately sees life as a comedy - as absurd - because he loses belief in free will. And that actually makes him a classic tragic figure. Arthur wanted to bring laughter and happiness into the world, but was always going to be the killer called the Joker.",0

This performance doesn't deserve number in grades, it desreve respect .But the real winner of this story is Todd Phillips, ( I bet he knoe what Joaquin can pool off, and he sow it right from the beginning), because it was a complicated story that only Joaquin could pull off; I really don't see another actor can make this role.

Joker,Triggering Masterpiece,"Everyone will appreciate this film, but only a select few will relate to it entirely. As someone who has deeply suffered with social isolation and severe depression, this is the only film in existence that had me crying my eyes out to the point of a near panic attack. My emotions were so high throughout the whole movie I could hardly pay attention to what was going on. Anyone who has ever felt emptiness so deep that you feel completely hollow, wanting to just give up entirely, wondering how it's so easy for everyone else, please be warned. You should not view this movie if you have any recent depressive episodes. This film brought me back to being a teenager, so angry with the society that rejected me, frustrated with those that would never understand themselves as being an involuntary contributor. As I was watching Joaquin Phoneix hit the threshold few of us have approached, watching his psyche crack and his spirit break, the audience around me was laughing at his superficially ""silly"" behavior. This admittedly made my blood boil to the point that I half wanted to lash out at their clear ambivalent ignorance, similarly to the path of the Joker. I'm partially worried for less stable people's potential reaction to this stunning performance. However hope this will help the general public who have not suffered with mental health, better understand what causes people to ""abruptly"" become ""crazy"". I spent an hour crying in my car afterwards, remembering how it felt to give up and just isolate myself instead, crawling into a dark hole. I can honestly say I have never related to a performance to this extent. The character development was nothing short of a masterpiece.",0
Joker,A truthful look at one mans disturbing journey,"I do not like super hero movies. Fortunately, this is not one. This is an incredibly disturbing character study of a man who happens to appear in comic books and other movies. This man is different than all of those other men. This man has nothing to do with those other men. It is not necessary to compare Arthur Fleck to the Joker of the Dark Knight. This is not about that joker. Arthur Fleck does not become that Joker.This is the story of a mentally ill man who becomes an accidental icon. It is not a negative statement against mental illness. It is a look at one mentally ill man. It is not in any way saying that all mentally ill people become homocidal maniacs. Arthur Fleck just happens to become one.Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent interpretation of a very creative script. He is not trying to play ""the Joker"". He is trying to tell the truth of one mans life, and he succeeds. It is very disturbing to watch. It's more disturbing to sit with the thoughts you will have about yourself and about society while Arthur's story unfolds. I was also disturbed by the audience around me, and also by myself, laughing at dark moments in this mans life. This movie holds a mirror to society and it's hard to ignore the image you see reflected before your eyes. Go see it, it's worth it.",0

Joker,Give this man an Oscar!,"Mesmerizing performance by the legendary Joaquin Phoenix is only one piece of a puzzle that makes this movie a must to watch. You simply cannot move your eyes away from him throughout the entire film and that's about 99.9 percent of the time he is on screen. Yes, he carries it on his own and everyone else is just a side character.
The screenplay and the brilliant direction Todd Phillips decides to take the film surpasses all the expectations of the viewer. When watching it, it's very difficult to predict what will happen in the next scene and that's what makes this film stand out from the bunch.
I don't remember the last time, I was asking that many questions after leaving the theater.
As a matter of fact, I am going to see the film again tonight to try to comprehend the complex nature of Arthur Fleck's mind and just to enjoy the brilliant cinematography.4 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A movie you wish it lasted forever,"Taking it as a whole since its chilling beginning to the groundbreaking Joker-worthy ending, this movie should be recognized as a movie you don't want a sequel to, but only wished it lasted forever. Joaquin's masterpiece acting should, throughout the upcoming decades, be described as one of the best, if not the very top, of what we've ever been able to witness.4 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Simply Brilliant,"After the longest time DC comes back with a bang to remind the world where the real story begins. Joker is simply a showcase of true brilliance of Todd Phillips and Joaquin illustrating the roots of a madman. The concept of one bad day which could happen to anyone has been so well portrayed that it's truly a treat for anyone who sits through the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Regardless of the timelines Joaquin has outdone himself to bring life to a character which many felt was irreplaceable after the performance of the great Heath Ledger.Joaquin's joker is a reminder to all Batman fans who have watched through the decades, of Mark Richard Hamill and the insane joker that he has given us back in the 90's. In comparison to the joker which we see in this movie is a crazy psychopath in the making as compared to the schizophrenic joker that Heath Ledger plays in the Dark Knight.Both jokers have done justice to the character and probably the most dreaded villian of the Batman. The transition of the joker is worth every single second of this movie, and I could bet that you wouldn't want the movie to end when it ends.",0
Joker,Masterpiece. Best Joker adaptation.,This movie is a study on mental illness. It brings awareness about problems in society. Not giving anything else away. You'd have to see it to believe it. Joaquin Phoenix exceeded my expectations. His Joker has surpassed Heath Ledger's version in my opinion.4 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0
Joker,You have to see it.,"People should go and see it I think was a master piece I honestly believe that. The acting, the picture, the scenes. I haven't seen anything so disturbing in a long long time. After 30 minutes I was so uncomfortable but at the same time so curious to see what it is going to happen .When I say is disturbing is because it is real, It is not the same Batman films with explosions and unreal mystic powers magic or anything like that. After watching this film you will be more careful about people any people, because mental illness is real and you never know when you will find a psychopath , he or she can be sit next to you. It is a journey how a sick society can destroy humans. BTW the trailers shows nothing about the real film.4 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Quite simply, perfection.","A gritty character study of Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society is IMDB's excellent byline description of this deep exploration of disintegrating (disintegrated?) mental health.It's described as taking place in the 'Scorseseverse' by some critics, in that Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck appears to be an homage to many of Scorsese's monumental 70's characters. And what's more, De Niro has a supporting role that shows he still can deliver the goods when not just taking a part for the money.So I've already used the M word and in this Academy Award winning performance (of that there is no doubt) Joaquim Phoenix's monumental performance will put the Academy back on track after their laughable decision to recognise Rami Malek for impersonating Freddie Mercury last year.I detest impersonation movies on the whole, but this is no impersonation, this is a character crafted out of magic. It's not a superhero movie in the slightest and all the better for it. It's simply a character study of great depth and extreme nuance.One thing I loved about this intense study of a disintegrating man is the extreme close ups that shows Phoenix in all his imperfections, his upper lip, his wonky teeth, his chewed finger nails, his nicotine stained fingers (possibly make-up). It's glorious.It is unquestionably a masterpiece, not just for Phoenix's performance, but for every SINGLE aspect of cinema: music (White Room by Cream blasts out of the screen in the final apocalyptic act to tremendous effect - but it's outstanding throughout), make-up (stunning), costume (stunning), cinematography (stunning - the dance on the steps and the aerial train track shot particularly blew me away), design (epic) and direction (Todd Phillips follows up his epic production, but not direction, of A Star Is Born remarkably It's interesting looking at Todd Phillips' Filmography though - a real mixed bag with much of it centred on comedy - The Hangover in particular.)But you don't need me to tell you how good this movie is - you don't get a 9.1 rating on IMDB without reason.See it and bathe in its mastery.",0

Joker,Brilliant. And best joker I've ever seen.. It is an absolute Masterpiece.,"Joaquin Phoenix-starrer Joker is solid in both its craft and storytelling but the violence is unsettling and leans dangerously close to being irresponsible and depends upon the emotional titillation of the audience. The story is diverse and depends upon the perspective of the audience. The psychological
aspects of the show are fairly accurate and it also depicts the financial gap between the rich and poor, the upbringing of their children and the daily problems faced by them.7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,This is the only time I watched a movie more than once in theaters,"I was very nervous when I went to see this film. The joker character is one of my favorite ch of all time, and I was worried showing the characters origin story would take away the mystery and make him less interesting. This film however put so much thought and effort into his background that I left the theater completely in love.
Joaquin phoenix did a perfect job playing as Arthur, and he absolutely deserves that Oscar. He is without a doubt the best part of the film. I cried, cheered, was worried and in suspense fall throughout the film because of him.
Everytime I watch the film I discover something new that adds more to the story. There is so much detail shown throughout the film that it really makes me appreciate how much effort Todd Phillips put into this film. There are so many different ways to interpret the film that it constantly has me evaluating it trying to come up with different theories as of what's going on.
There are a few flaws I noticed, or at least small things that bothers me. But the good heavily outweighs the bad, and the flaws I've noticed don't take away from the story or the drama. This film is truly a must see. The cinematography, acting, drama, story, and score is done so wonderfully that you'll always be engaged",0

Joker,You'll never root for Batman again,"A film about the Joker. What a great idea! Jared Leno must be delighted to be front and centre as arguably one of the most famous and recognisable bad-guys ever in popular culture. Unfortunately, DC's 'shared universe' ran into one or ten problems and has become fractured into... well, no one really knows what. Only that Jared Leno's 'Joker' appears to have been dumped after his woefully small appearance in 'Suicide Squad' and now Joaquin Phoenix puts on the clown make-up for the role.How 'Joker' fits in with what has been and what is left of DC's original attempt at bringing 'Justice League' together is anyone's guess. If you liked (or hated!) all those previous installments it doesn't really matter. Don't go into this film looking to see how it ties in. There might be a sequel, there might now. It doesn't matter. This film is so good that I almost hope it stays as a 'stand alone' film, just in case the quality deteriorates.Phoenix plays 'Arthur Fleck' (yup, no more 'Jack Napier' here!), a down-on-his-luck resident of Gotham City who struggles with his mental health issues while just about scraping a living working as a clown and looking after his sickly mother. It's rare that a film - even one that's mainly about a single individual - actually has that character in every scene. With 'Joker' there's rarely a minute where Phoenix isn't on screen... and therefore stealing the scene. Robert DeNiro is also on the cast list and - yes - obviously he's excellent (but he's not in it that much, so don't expect too much screen time for him). It's also interesting that many people also see the similarities of two of DeNiro's other work. If you've seen (and, if not, I recommend you watch) 'Taxi Driver' or 'King of Comedy' then you'll see more than a few nods here and there.I know that many recent Batman fans will say that there's no other Joker than Heath Ledger and us oldies will always say that Jack Nicholson did it best. I certainly won't argue with anyone who admires either of their performances, but Phoenix shows that, even stepping into their big clown shoes, he can still bring something new to the role.Yes, it's - technically - a superhero film, but it never really feels like one. There are no lavish computer-generated special effects of heroes/villains with superpowers. There are plenty of points which obviously link in to the whole 'Batman mythos,' but you could almost watch this film as more of a study of mental illness than an 'origin story' for the Joker.It may not be for everyone. Yes, it is brutal and there are some shockingly-real acts of graphic violence here and there. There's been a lot of speculation in the media about 'Joker's' hidden meaning and the impact creating a film about a villain and promoting them as a 'hero.' Personally, I don't think that anyone (sane) would ever commit any sore of crime because of a movie, even this one. One reviewer said it best when he said that there wasn't a massive spike in violent crime after the cinematic release of 'American Psycho' so why would there be one now with 'Joker?' The character 'Joker' - despite being the focus of the story - is never really shown as some sort of 'role model' for us all to follow. We may understand - some of - his motives, but anyone in their right mind would never truly wish to emulate him.I don't want to give away anything away about the plot as this is a film you really do need to watch yourself. I'm not one to say who should be in line for an Oscar. I don't know whether Phoenix will win one (probably not), but his performance is definitely worthy of praise.",0
Joker,A MASTERPIECE,"People were expecting this movie and this joker to be just like The Dark Knight, but how can it be when they're showing his journey from the beginning, and realistically speaking, how can a normal man with no history of violence can do what the Joker from dark knight did? I'm in love with the new storyline, and how society and some mental illnesses made him what he is, the whole movie makes so much sense. if the Joker is a real person in this world that would be the how he turned into Joker, that what makes it a 10/10, + the effects, the cinematography and how dark the violence is, and in my opinion without overhyping it, i consider it the movie of the decade.7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,I wasn't expecting much from this movie and fell in love with it!,"First of all, the message in this film is great especially with what's going on in the world. Everybody who goes to see this movie will probably walk away thinking the exact same thing and know what the message is. At this point I think it's pretty obvious what everybody already knows and I'm just going to put in my five cents and that's Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/Joker and he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. He went all-in with this character showing the different stages in his life and making everybody feel bad for him. At certain points in the film, I felt really bad for the guy and wanted to help him out because nobody deserves to be treated that way. It also helps that he didn't start out as wanting to become the Joker but society just helped turn him into him. Robert De Niro, who plays Murray Franklin, probably won't get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor but he still did a standout job with his character. Another thing that stood out to me was the cinematography of the movie and how it helped show Arthur's slow descent into madness and how he views the world. I feel like some people are waiting for me to hate on the pacing of this film and honestly, I had no problem with it at all. If the movie was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on and any shorter and they would have rushed the Joker transformation. But with that in mind, this film is like most people have said already and that's a character story. So, if you don't want to watch a story about a man who's driven to his breaking point and wants to see an action superhero then stay home and watch The Dark Knight. I love how the costume was different from any Joker suit we've seen before, though it's hard to replicate without buying a store-bought costume. The music by Hildur Guonadottir was amazing. In the end, this movie is an amazing character story with an important message. I give Joker a 10/10.",0

Joker,Beyond Expectations,"This film is something else, being a DC fan all my life, I'm certainly glad to see a different take on The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is potentially one of the best Jokers now.

Todd Phillip's vision for a gritty non-comic based Joker film really sheds light on the problems Gotham's society. Which can easily portray a number of the problems in our actual society. Things such as lack of funding for mental health, rude and terrible people who only want to bring others down, and simply crime.

Joker,A Masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix could be the next Oscar winner,"Dear movie freaks, Joker is the most anticipated movie that we have been expecting since the first month of year 2019 and yes this is a very good dramatic movie. I said dramatic because Joker delivers us the ideas on how Arthur Fleck character can be Joker, right when we totally forgot about Batman appearance. We don't care about Batman here. We care about a joker, a comedian, a broken child, and a really sad story of a man who sacrifices everything to be happy, yet we never really understand what is going on his mind and heart, until we saw the killings and the blood and we blame him as a villain. I really salute the Director, the make up team, editor, cinematographer, scriptwriter, and Joacquin Phoenix acting, wow he could win Oscar for this movie. This movie has few actions, but a lot of tears and drama and how we can reflect to ourselves, are we really happy or just a made-up-happy just to make our life comfortable....2 hours are not enough to understand Joker but I really love the ending that you can't watch without clapping your hands.

With Rob Pattinson cast as Batman, I'm optimistic it's a perfect role for him as how Jacquin Phoenix is the perfect one to play the Joker. Before, you'd think The Dark Knight is a dark story, and Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is the perfect actor to play the Joker. You'll change your mind. Hats off to you Jacquin.

Joker,Much needed masterpiece,"Wow ! I'll be honest that I did not expect this one to live up to the hype, but it did. We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you. This is one of the greatest films that has come out in this decade. Congrats to the whole team who made it possible, outstanding job !",0

Joker,Believe the hype!,"I was hesitant when I was going to see this because the IMDB score was so high that I honestly figured people (comic and Batman fans, DC fans, Joker fans etc..) were just rating it a 10 without seeing it. I can't remember the last time a movie has exceeded my expectations this much. In my personal opinion, this is now the best portrayal of the Joker in history....just barely edging out Heath. I honestly think Heath would be super proud!I'm not going to get into any details, because you should most definitely experience this movie first hand...the acting, cinematography, production, writing/dialogue and story are all TOP NOTCH and it is most definitely Oscar worthy....In fact, i have a feeling this movie is going to sweep the Oscar's...it is THAT good!I suggest seeing it while it is still playing in theaters, because the movie-going experience of seeing this on the big screen is second to none!",0
Joker,"Dark, Gritty and Absolutely Breathtaking","First of all, this has to be performance that could finally land Joaquin Phoenix his long overdue Oscar. He handled the characterizaton almost flawlessly. Fans of Heath Ledger's Joker would surely be proud at Phoenix's performance.The plot is gripping and does not for once drag with time. The supporting cast is brilliant as well while the direction and cinematography are top notch. It's a movie that I wouldn't mind watching again because I know it will still blow me away.

Joker,Leaves you speechless!,"Joker is an original movie about the iconic Batman villain of the same name, exploring his origins. It tells the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), a man who feels rejected by society.Joker is a mind-blowing film. Director Todd Phillips has given us a one of a kind comic book movie, that delves deep into the psyche of its titular character. What we get is a riveting film with twists & turns, that will leave you guessing, right till the end. Joaquin Phoenix is the star of the show, as Arthur Fleck. Phoenix completely immerses himself in the role & gives us another unforgettable performance. He deserves all the praise, accolades & Oscar buzz coming his way. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker, matches up to Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker, in The Dark Knight(2008). He also gives us a perfectly chilling 'Joker laugh'. Robert De Niro is awesome as Murray Franklin. Zazie Beetz is spectacular as Sophie Dumond. Frances Conroy is outstanding as Penny Fleck. Brett Cullen is amazing as Thomas Wayne. Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler & Leigh Gill are superb as Detective Burke, Detective Garrity, Randall & Gary, respectively. The supporting cast is excellent. Joker is a must watch for all the fans of one of the best comic book villains of all time. Go for it, as soon as possible!",0
Joker,Speechless ....,"The film is different from anything I've seen before. Normally the villain is part of a hero story - but here everything revolves around the icon of all movie villains. Without giving anything away, this is a must-see movie. But beware, it's the kind of movie where you end up sitting in the seat speechless and thinking: ""What?!??"".Joaquin is great and definitely deserves an Oscar for this outstanding role he plays!10 out of 21 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Awesome,"So this was well promoted on every social net you could think. So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5

Joker,Not For Everyone.,"Well, I see a lot of people complaining about this movie that it isn't reasonable because they don't understand the movie. It isn't necessary that you don't find a movie logical so it's a bad movie. Really I feel sorry for those people or simply haters. People fears or hates what they don't realize and as for the movie this is just one of those types. This is not your typical movie which will make you laugh, will entertain you in every way possible and in the end will give you a happy ending so that you can make it out of the theater and tell everyone ''it's a great movie'', no it is not that way at all. 'Joker' is something with greater meaning which will make you pointing your own finger at yourself. It is a character study that will make you standing on your feet and applauding if you got the message. I think this is where i might cut it short, here is a simple suggestion, go to the hall and watch the movie. Not to forget about 'Joaquin Phoenix' you just did a hell of acting right there. A well deserving movie which isn't meant for everyone.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Joker is way much more than 10 years of all the stupid MCU,"It doesn't need a film critic to praise how superior is this movie to many comic book character movie. Phoenix delivers a performance worth of an academy award and Phillips delivers a complete and mesmerizing story. Much MORE than any dumb, empty, and CGI-filled story produced with a joke each 5 minutes (yes, I'm talking about you MCU). Joker definitely worth a thousand views. Well done.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Powerful film on social commentary using a comic book villian,"I can understand why some people would not like it. The pace was slow. There were moments that would make the audience saying ""What?"", kinds of like playing games. However, the movie on the whole was a powerful one. We were basically in his head most of the movie. We saw what he sees, and this guy was a walking time bomb. He had many sign of trouble, lack of confidence, self insecure, and loneliness. Because the problem was not treated, he went spiraled down. He could be a metaphor for many brewing problems, like he could be Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square massacre when the city got traumatized for those who know the history of the city. Despite the slow pace, I thought it fitted perfectly his inner struggle and his mental breakdown. The setting was outstanding, and needless to say the performance. Hard to say if I still like it on another viewing, but at this moment it is one of the best movies I have seen from 2019.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Simply incredible!,"I won't say much because it might ruin it for others but I can safely say this is one of my favourite movies of all-time and only once before have I given a movie 10 stars and that was ""Saving Private Ryan"". It will be criminal if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win Best Actor at the Academy Awards and this movie has to win Best Movie. I've already watched it twice. The plot and the acting are second to none. I just can't get over how good it was. Hopefully a sequel is in the works.

Joker,"Uncanny performance of Phoenix, top notch cinematography, epic music score, wonderful supporting cast","Perhaps bias, perhaps not, but what a movie. I haven't seen many movies from Joaquin Phoenix apart from Gladiator, so not knowledgeable about his abilities as an actor. But I am pretty sure after seeing this performance that he ranks amongst the best at this time.I was a huge fan of Heath Ledger in the last great Joker appearance (lets forget the Suicide Squad) in Dark Knight, but I'm considering this to be even better. Better because Joaquin and director Philips, never attempted to emulate that Joker, but installed a completely new version of him. A man driven to madness. The expression on Joaquin's face is so intensive and plain scary.The cinematography, the fitting music, the original Joker theme, gotta gotta give Todd the kudos, Oscar worthy at least. As I understand it, he was as amazed at Joaquin's performance as most of the movie loving audience.The last 30 minutes of the film were exceptional. Multiple violent scenes, leading up to his appearance on De Niro's tv show (great acting here as well on De Niro's part), the shocking finale, the rise of the Joker as anti hero and the last scene which will be debated until the next instalment of the Joker (2).Dear movie lovers, if you can handle violence, if you can appreciate great acting and love musical scores, see this movie on the big screen while you still can. you won't regret it.",0
Joker,Joker,"Unquestionably the most sensational autobiography on a villain I've seen to date. Joker is masterful in almost every aspect, but most importantly, able to truly focus on the inner workings of perhaps the most well-known in the superhero realm. The best part of the film is that it is not dumbed down to suit the fanboys, it is done in a mature and art-house way to influence and inspire the audience. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar level performance that is one for the ages. Also love the uncertainty of every scene, the constant questioning of what is real and what is not. The eccentricity of the character does not feel forced, it conjures a sort of sympathy from the audience throughout the film. Every scene, every movement and every dialogue felt sinister in a poetic way.Not sure if the DC Universe can follow suit after this, but I think they should leave this as an independent work. Felt the last scene with Thomas Wayne is somewhat unnecessary and broke the mood a little.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,The darkest yet most important pieces of cinema in recent years,"Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is unquestionably one of the darkest yet incredibly powerful and important pieces of cinema in recent years. Reactions have ranged from wholly irresponsible, to mean spirited. However, one which is not particularly explored is its seeming importance in an age of which Gotham's societal issues seem much like any other western city. To say that Joker is a microcosm of today's society would not be much of a stretch - in fact it would be pretty accurate.Gotham is in-turmoil, as a consequence of strikes its streets are littered with rubbish, the rich are getting richer, budgets are getting cut and seemingly the powers to be have no interest or do not deem mental health to be of importance; sound familiar? Within this toxic, cruel and bitter city Arthur Fleck (Joker, Joaquin Phoenix) a troubled and struggling comic suffering from severe mental disorders has to go about his daily life and make sense of his own reality. After finding out his mental health treatments will be cut and the state will no longer provide funds for his medication he is left to fend for himself.To say that the comic to movie trick has run its creative course would be an understatement. In-fact, to say that Marvel and DC have squeezed every last penny out of each generic, painstaking superhero franchise would be a lie - because there is undoubtedly another one coming out next week (even if you are reading this in 2035). Having said that what director Todd Phillips alongside writer Scott Silver have managed to accomplish is to reinvent (yet again) what a comic book character can embody and stand for. Director of the Hangover movies and Due Date (although good comedic movies in their own right) Phillips' rebirth is perhaps the biggest surprise to 2019. Each and every element of Joker is perfectly on point, and Phillips' envision of what a Joker movie should entail is clearly brought to life. Phillips' depiction of the Joker's world is awesomely dark and that darkness transpires through its spectral score, glum environment and intense visual acting.Joaquin's Joker is truly his own, in which the brilliant script and plot gives him the freedom to do so. His desperate, insidious undertones are apparent throughout, of which occasionally becomes satisfyingly uncomfortable. From his uncontrollable laughing fits to his existential dance routines this is one obscenely creepy guy. Compassion or sympathy are not words that spring to mind when describing the Joker; rather pity. Pity for his intolerably unfortunate set of circumstances in that he is left to his own devices to tackle his awful existence without the support or help from anyone.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is eerily beautiful in all the ways it should be, bordering on uncomfortable at times this film rides the cusp perfectly. Always leaving you second guessing, each scene feels as though it is improvised (in a good way) and it is truly impossible to predict which way each set piece will go. Each scene contributes seamlessly to the overall narrative that Phillips is trying to convey, it's with-strained and outright outlandish when required. It seems that the Joker has raised a few heads and its controversial undertones might just mean it misses out on best picture. However, for its sheer audacity it should certainly be in contention.",0

Joker,So that was...quit the expierience.,"K this was an incredible work of art, not gonna beat around the bush. Jauquin pheonix is giving a career highlight here, it might be even better than his performance in the master but I'll have to think about that. Tod philips and cinematographer Laurence shaper have made a beautifully shot movie, and the shot length really gives pheonix and De Niro room to act. The camera work itself is also very well done, but its not the type off camera work that calls attention to itself like that of Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese. The blending of reality and fantasy and reality is also extremely well handled, I'm not gonna give spoilers but I will say that its kind of like American psycho and middle school:the worst years of my life (does anybody's remember that book?). It is important to mention that this movie is not for everyone, it is violent and intense, but that being said its not as violent as other art house movies like drive or hereditary. No, its not really the violence as much as the intensity and the emotion that the film evokes, which is most certainly not a complaint its a great aspect of the film. Cinifix's 10 most emotional movie moments has 2 slots in it that focus on second hand embarrassment or cringe and deep uncofortable-ness and I'd say about 87 percent of the film are squarely in those 2 spaces. Overall this movie in its own special way is a masterpiece, even if its not at all easy to watch.",0

The acting was phenomenal. In some scene Joaquin was conveying several emotions at the same time with total surrender and believability. I was just in awe to see a human do this. That's acting on master level. At the same time you saw this very fragile looking human being a victim of his illness and environment and on the other this incredibly strong will (insanity ?) shining through. The cinematography was just amazing. I was drawn into this dark depressing environment but with such a visual clarity and details. I almost forgot the music. There was this cello music emphasizing dark insanity coming out drawing you further into the scenes. And during the action scenes some very fitting songs were started in perfect synchrony. Great.

Joker,Movie of the Year!,"It was pretty clear from before the movie got released that despite being a central comic book villain, Joker would not be anywhere along the lines of any superhero/super villain film we've ever seen. Instead of having the clown of Gotham going on a mad rampage to burn down the city, we witness an origin story for Joker : a story of how a normal if not slightly delusional person on being bogged down by society can turn into an uncontrollable, cold-blooded madman that we all know of.Joker's alter ego Arthur Fleck's struggles makes it immensely relatable and it is amazing to watch the character develop throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix never fails, delivering a strong performance and proving that he is one of the best, most devoted method actors in the industry.Joker rides on a simple plot fueled by a cast of extraordinary actors and a spine-chilling soundtrack which goes perfect with the protagonist's actions. With a couple of gory scenes, the movie can feel a bit heavy to handle. The movie, with beautiful cinematography ,successfully captures the essence Prince Clown of Gotham!",0

I can understand why some of the critics dislike this movie while they like similar or even more hardcore movies compared to this, one of the main reason has to go to the realistic feel of this movie, i have never seen acting like that ever before. The movie is so realistic and it tackles real life issues that ought to make anyone uncomfortable but in a positive way, i do not think this movie has the potential to incite gun violence etc(please, john wick anyone?), those are just rubbish.

Joker,A thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about.,"As someone who isn't that big of a fan of the DCEU thanks to the quality of the films being kind of wonky (a few are great, a few are just okay, a few are really bad), I wasn't expecting that much here, considering that this film, besides having the Joker, has nothing to even do with the DCEU. Plus, as great as Joaquin Phoenix is as an actor, he was never exactly the first guy to come to mind when thinking of who to play the demented clown himself. So, you can imagine my shock and amazement after coming out of the movie theater, because, oh my god, this film is incredible. It takes everything you thought you knew about the Joker and not only flips it on its head, but expands upon it tenfold. The way this film portrays what Arthur is going through and how he evolves into the Joker is some of the best character development I have ever seen in a film. This film has a perfect balance of making you sympathize with the main character, while also making you mindful of the terrible acts he has done. It can feel a bit disturbing to almost side with someone who's obviously dangerous, but the way this film manages that is genius. All of this is helped by two things. Smart and excellent writing, as well as the performance. The story is great. It's well paced, thought provoking, smart, poignant, and constantly almost eye opening. Joaquin Phoenix was pretty much perfect. His performance is Oscar worthy here, as he really did become the main character. When Arthur laughed because of his condition, I really felt the pain behind it. Seeing how his life is and how he lives it really seemed real, and that's what helped me sympathize with him, even though, again, he's dangerous. If all of that wasn't enough, everything else about this movie is great too. The direction from Todd Phillips really shines, as the way this film is structured and put together helps the film not only flow really well, but to be delightfully dark and twisted. The performances from everyone else were all great too. Robert De Niro was phenomenal as Murray Franklin, as he was very committed, which helped him really turn into the talk show host from this film. The same thing can be said for everyone else, whether it be Frances Conroy as Arthur's mother or Zazie Beetz as his love interest. Everyone did great, as well as Todd Phillips for making such an incredible film that delves into the mind of the demented clown while making it extremely heartfelt. I also loved how they linked the Wayne family to the story. I won't say what happened to avoid spoilers, but that really helped this feel like a true part of Batman's past, all of which happened in a movie where the caped crusader isn't even around yet (I hope, because a Batman film after this would be awesome in my opinion). Overall, this film is amazing, and I recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so, because it not only has fan service aplenty to longtime fans of the Joker, but it also has everything that makes a great movie great so that it can be enjoyed by anyone. One last thing to note is that there is a lot, and I mean a LOT of gore in this film, so if you're squeamish about that, then I'd probably wait until I'm ready to see it. I say watch this with an open mind, and what you'll experience is a thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about and tells it damn near perfectly.",0
Joker,Acting performance is beyond expectations,"Joaquin Phoenix should get the Oscar 3 years in a row, for the Joker performance. Amazing physical change and adaptation for the role.

Joker,A new classic,"I have to admit that I had a certain fear to this film.
The first thing I'm a big DC fan, the Joker is my favorite DC villain, and to make a movie about him without Batman, somehow illogical and unimaginable.
Second, the director is Todd Phillips who has now done only comedies (admittedly good and really good) such as Hangover, Due Date and Road Trip. I knew that Joaquin will be great as he has already proven and rewarded an actor with several great roles, but history has taught me that it's no guarantee because the last Joker was catastrophic and the actor is also a great actor (Jared Leto has an Oscar).I was so wrong.The film is perfect, crafty and brutal.
Most of all it tells me that even after three days of looking at it, I still think about him, about acting, about scenes, about music, about a possible message.
As expected, Joaquin was singled out by the big screen overall. Each scene is his own, he ate the part and ordered the desert afterwards. He brutally gave himself into it, physically and mentally. Honestly, it will be a bigger surprise if he doesn't win an Oscar, but it doesn't even matter given the award history. He showed so many emotions and layers of one fictional character on a larger level, leaning to the floor!
Any comparisons to Ledger are unnecessary, they both did the job to the highest possible level, each with their own version that fits the film. Both are perfect.
I did mind the two minor things in the movie, however they turned it around to fit the story so I have no qualms.
I really like that this can't be called some kind of superhero movie that we've been bombarded with for years, it's a pure psychological drama. It reminded me a lot of the tone and atmosphere of Taxi Driver, even in some scenes one can see the impact and similarities in Martin Scorsese's film. It was as if it was shot in the 1970s which was Hollywood's prime golden age.Honestly, the reactions of film critics, ranging from disappointment to excellent, were not clear to me. In the last few years, you may have 5 films for which you will become a cult classic in the future. The Joker is definitely one of them.Purely subjective and well deserved ten!",0
Joker,A painfully thorough diagnosis,"Finally we get a Joker who is not Batman-centered, a Joker who walks his own path and tells his own story. Thank you!
This is the best 2019 movie to hit theaters and it will stay in the minds everyone who watched for a long time whether you liked or disliked it.
It's not a movie for the critics' praise, rather than a medical diagnosis of our time. Should you fail to notice the message Joker brings, you might as well surround yourself with happy thoughts and watch a Disney movie.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,An Uncomfortable Masterpiece,"'Joker' is an uncomfortable masterpiece that will leave you walking away from the movie theatre confused about how you feel. It's a conversation piece that anchors itself deep into the origins, mentality and motivations of a disturbing psychopathic anarchist.This movie isn't for everyone, especially if what you're expecting to see is a thrilling face off between a villain and a superhero. But if your going into this movie wanting to see and feel something you've never seen or felt before, then you're in for one hell of an experience.Most films will leave you with a short term emotion, this film is one of few leaving you with many long term emotions that take a while to process, and that, in my opinion, is what makes a movie deserving of 10/10.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Must watch movie.,"Though the movie JOKER is kind of brutal, it serves an eye-opener to each one of us.
Depression is a really serious issue and a lot of people are experiencing this. They may look happy on the outside but we don't know that these people are facing some issues in their everyday life such as being bullied.
We should be mindful of our actions and words being uttered. Never make fun of other people's feelings as this can make someone feel crazy, feel depressed and worst, causing them to end their own lives.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,The best and most believable Joker I have ever seen!,"I already wrote a review, but after reading afew reviews which are giving bad points and talking about violence, I decied to update my review.I want to ask these guys who are giving bad review and taling about violence.
Do you know who is JOKER? You think you come to cinema and watch Romeo and Juliet? JOKER is a criminal, one of the most scary and crazy criminals in all history. So if he takes his victims and cut their body to separate parts you shouldn't be surprised because that's JOKER. That's how it should be, nothing else. So if you can not watch it, go watch some melodrama movie
The funny thing is there are too many movies with 100 times more violence like Game of Thrones, John Wick and .... But you know why they say Joker has more Violence? Because on other movies you say, OK, that's just a movie, but in JOKER you believe it. It's so real. You live with the Joker from beginning until end and you accept and believe what he does. You never says, OK that's just a movie. You say damn it's real life. It's so real!
You feel him, you get sad for him, you have pain with him and you scare of him as hell. That's a real act and movie should be!Also never compare jokers together, all of them were good in their time and the movie they played. But the Joker Phoenix played is so real and accetbale. Is not like superhero movies. Is like yeah, that's why Joker exist. You beleive everybody can be a Joker if we had a miserable life like him. So if you go to cinema just enjoy from his act. Don't sit and say, oh Heath Ledger was better or Phoenix. Just enojy!I just saw this masterpiece first day came to cinema and all my mind is still with the movie!
My wife says, finish it!!! You are all the time talking about movie at home haha...
But that was realllllllyyyy good. An amazing masterpiece!!!
Next week I have to keep children and she goes for watching. Because now she is curious to watch what is this movie I am all the time taling about. It's a pitty we can not watch together, somebody should keep children. But soon I go for watching again.
Phoenix did the performance 10 times better than I expected. You really belive the character of Joker opposite of superhero movies. His laughs, acts and crimes ... In cinema nobody was talking, you couldn't hear even one word, even when movie finished. Everybody mind was blown away and with that silence everybody left cinema.
Thank you for such a great masterpiece!",0

Joker,"Sorry Heath, you've been bumped.","I dislike the DC universe, to be frank. Justice League, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Superman are boring let downs. Chris Nolan's vision of Batman was certainly decent. Heath Ledger's Joker was compelling and certainly a worthy performance. Joaquin Phoenix has redefined this character in a way that will not be touched by anyone for a long time. This movie is a character study beyond words. I loved it. It's just amazing.I am hopeful that this blueprint will pave the way for more sophisticated adaptations for superhero/antihero movies. It was, at times, heartwrenching and other times downright tense to experience. To the detractors that say that this movie will produce violence....grow up. This is a movie about a VILLAIN. If you didn't assume that violence was a part of the formula, then you are not firing on all cylinders.Oscar's better be in the forecast.8 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joaquin Phoenix is PERFECT, and he totally deserves an Oscar nomination for that awesome performance
The haunting soundtrack of hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir totally augmented the experience of the movie
And last but not least Todd Phillips' directing which had a lot of frames that is art gallery worthy.

Joker,A punch movie for an unconscious society,"... Joker ... - From a DC Comic book: is a grandiose movie if there is one, produced in a sensational way by ""Todd Phillips"" who knew how to make an incredibly realistic human impact, without ever taking lose sight of this vision of a sick society, which despises and destroys the most vulnerable, and simply lets appear a deep evil lurking in the shadows and which feeds on the vulnerability of a growing class of the most humble of our society, which acts like a poison that slowly infuses to end up intoxicating a society that is losing more and more of all these benchmarks.The movie is brought to the zenith by the exceptional performance of Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) who bursts the screen from the first to the last frame, giving even more power to this exceptional movie.

This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I might even watch it again this morning.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Is there a need for a box-office uprising?,"You have to see this film to believe it. It's a masterpiece. More so in a world where comicbook-blockbusters and cash crabs rule Hollywood. Todd Philipps and Joaquin Phoenix did what nobody in their wildest dream could imagine: to make one of the most profitable movies with a small kind of art-house film in the DC-Batman-universe. Thanks to Philipps and Phoenix, a great many young people watched for the first time an honest movie which was made with a very special vision and told almost perfectly the story about a man struggling with life and how society interacts with him. The soundtrack alone is worth the admission. But the performance of Phoenix is out of this world. After I saw the soulless, brainless Star Wars 9 episode, I wonder when will the audience break away from movies which scripts are written from marketing and merchandising hacks. It seems there is a strong need for a box-office uprising.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Review joker,"Wow..........
What was that last night, I finally watched Joker.And what was that!
The movie was in my eyes fantastic.
Acting/cinematography/writing/soundtrack
I can only describe this movie in one word ""amazing"". So, let's talk about the acting of Joaquin Phoenix.
I have never see someone blend in his role like he did.
Like when he first killed those 3 guys in the subway, he had in that scene so much anger but also sadness.
It really looked like Phoenix was for real angry and sad.
And all of the other scene's, I just got the chills.
So like everyone say, he really deserve an Oscar.And then a big applause for Todd Phillips, how he write and direct this movie.
There was no second I thought when is this movie done.
The only sort of negative thing was, that the first half came up really slow.
But the second half made it good.My favorite thing about the whole movie was that sort of amusing part.
The music, the little jokes and his sentence; First I thought my life was a tragedy but actually it's a comedy.So here a summary,
Joker is a amazing movie, I am 100% sure that it is the best Dc movie that is ever made.
Acting/cinematography/writing/soundtrack are awesome.
And Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor ( btw this is the first movie that I saw with him).
And I enjoyed it so much.",0
Joker,A social service professional,"Wow! The most honestly portrayed movie version of how stigmatized mental health has been and still is in present day.

Joker,Best movie,"No joke this is by far the best movie that I've ever watch in my entire life and surpassing the magnificent movie 'Seven' (1995). At first I felt bad for the protagonist Arthur Fleck but when he starting to change into becoming the Joker I felt terrified of him which is amazing that the movie accomplished that. This movie is also not for everyone because of the lack of action and always annoys me when people saying this movie is bad with the reason of ""This movie is boring"". I really recommend you who likes a good story but I do not recommend this to the people who just want action like every Marvel movie.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,ONE OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLERS.,"The film never disappoints, not one bit. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker is brilliant as hell, he lets his acting ooze out from his eyes and his body. The film is not about Joker and his violence and neither the director (Todd Philips) or the screenwriters (Todd and co-writer Scott Silver) have tried showing it that way; It istead focuses on Arthur's descent into madness, driven by his experience of society and how he finds his solace in the chaos that was indirectly started by his actions.
A must watch for every cinephile(thanks to cinematography by Lawrence Sher) and a treat to watch. Send in the clowns- the best of 2019 is here ! And also, the 2nd best of the decade (only behind Inception).5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Oscar for Phoneix or we riot!,"I'm not a big fan of comic books, as the matter of fact I never read one and I usually don't care about movies based on them, Batman, Spiderman, Captain America, Marvel, DC, whatever... I'm a sucker for psychology movies and that's why I watched this one. And oh boy was it a good decision! If you're expecting your typical comic book-y Joker vs Batman, good vs evil kind of thing you will be disappointed. This is a study of REAL human madness, it's a critic of modern society, it's as real as it gets. Joker is a flawless movie, by far the greatest masterpiece of 21st century, and I am expecting at least one Oscar. And if it gets a sequel as good as this, that sequel deserves Oscar too.

Joker,A true masterpiece. Heath Ledger would've been proud.,"Joaquin Phoenix absolutely killed the movie (no pun intended) with his fantastic performance as Joker. The movie was beautiful and was smartly shot, if you're a person who notices small details like me, you'll be amazed by the details that were presented, like the colour scale in each scene as there was a specific pattern in that. The build-up in the background music also hinted how the character was developing until it reached the ""max level"" let us say. Even the scenes that were supposedly real, but turn out to be only a hallucination inside the mind of Arthur (Joker).
Moreover, despite what some people didn't like this movie just because it was too violent and showed that it was praising the evil and violence, while the real message is actual and should be taken seriously as we witness it from time to time, especially in school mass shootings. People don't end up killing the other all of a sudden, it is all built up from continuous bullying and getting abused, and when those people seek for help in mental health services lets say, they should really help them not just listening to them, asking the same questions over and over then give them medication which can get them addicted at some point.",0

Joker,"Joaquin Phoenix, take a bow","There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats.",0
Joker,'You don't really understand an antagonist until you understand why he's a protagonist in his own version of the world',"Such a sad movie with a consuming psychological depth. a dark portrayal of a character with an iconic and sorrowful laugh, who slowly collapses under the pressuring circumstances. great soundtracks and beautiful acting.
it seems to be an everyday tragic but it still touches you in a new and different way of raw & haunting reality. the best part: another interpretation of the joker. his disoriented and ""unintentionally"" actions are full of desperation, (always had a weak spot whenever I saw people hurting inside, and he definitely hit that). it really feels like the beginning of all - of how arthur becomes the joker.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Realistic Origin & Amazing, Gritty Performance","The film starts off slow but straight off the bat, compelling, interesting look into the life of Arthur Fleck, Joker. It is unclear whether or not this is the Infamous Joker aka Batman's nemesis. Without trying to spoil anything, it is unclear whether or not some parts of this origin are true or not, and this is because of an unreliable narrator/main character. This is what makes this movie stand out just as plenty of other stories do as well. The ability to give the audience/reader a chance to analyze the material and theorize themselves what it is that is being discussed or viewed. It was honestly an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It was reminiscent of Ledger's haunting performance that was truly one of a kind. And so is Joaquin's. It was a psychological masterpiece of not only the development of a character (one of the best like walter white level, and Joker is just a 2 hr movie) but the cinematography that made this mental breakdown come to life. I don't know whats up with the critics, but they definitely got this one wrong.I don't believe this needs a sequel... this is by far the greatest origin story for a mysterious villain arch storyline. And this coming from a Wolverine fan, Logan was great, this was superior... all we need is a Punisher Origin story, in the idea of Platoon. Joker deserves a 9.7.",0

Joker,In your face call for justice that upsets the corrupt elite,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a bad faith defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their charade might get uncovered. Joker might be delusional, but it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypocrites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.",0

Joker,Masterpiece,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)",0

Joker,Best Picture of the Year,"Best movie I've seen all year. The character development was amazing and had so much depth. It actually had me feeling empathy for this guy.

Joker,Powerfull Movie!,"This movie is a masterpiece. If you ever were bullied or have had depressions and felt like everybody is against you, you will feel with the joker through the whole movie.
This movie is unsettling from the get go and gets only worse from there on (but in a good way:)). As we witness how the character - Arthur Fleck, who will become the joker - is gradually sinking into insanity, caused by the selfish and cold world he lives in and by his own psyche.
The role of the Joker is delivered brilliantly by Joaquine Phoenix, who in my opinion, deserves an oscar for it.But beware!
Its a movie unlike other superhero movies. This one is more of a character study of the joker, why he became who he is. I would sort it into the Genre of Drama/Thriller.6 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Certainly not the most uplifting film to watch during this pandemic, but...","Of all films to watch during this pandemic when a comedy would have been more feasible, but I thought, 'hey, why not!' And I was curious to learn what all the hype was regarding Joaquin's performance in this film. Now I know why! He was brilliant and more than deserving of an Oscar for his performance as Joker.This film is of a controversial nature with a bleak and disturbing storyline that centers around a psycho who is sick and eventually turns to evil. No spoiler about the Joker, most folks know the story. Joaquin Phoenix cleverly manipulates the viewer's emotions with either disgust,hatred, or empathy toward the character, Arthur/Joker. I empathized with Arthur. Some people might find the subject matter too much to handle. Be it as it may, the storyline is so engaging and flows so well that you have no choice but to watch the movie to the end. Everything made sense as to how and why the Joker came to be. Outstanding production and cast!Joaquin's got a reputation for being odd. I think part of it is an act; maybe not. I don't care. I don't need to know what he does or did behind the scenes or why he decided to do this project. All I know is this man is an extremely intense and stellar actor. I also have to applaud the entire cast ensemble who was great as well, but Joaquin stands out among them all. He put his entire being into this character showing the viewer that yes, the character, Arthur had reasons for being the tormented soul that he was, and the story shows how cruel and uncaring people can be, not to mention Arthur's mother who was sick in more ways than one, both living in Gotham City ravaged with piling garbage and big, fat rats! First there is Arthur, the clown, then enter Joker!I could think of a couple of other actors who would have done a great job in this role such as Christian Bale and even Sam Rockwell. Both are outstanding actors and right up there on my favorites list, but I'm glad this role went to Joaquin Phoenix. He excels!",0
Joker,The best anti-system movie,"The movie is more about society and about the victims of this society rather than about one single person and his cruelty. And the oppressors are the state institutions which don't care about unwealthy, unhealthy and alone citizens and just call them ""clowns"" following the rules of the jungles. As a result, those ""clowns"" raised against the system and started to talk to it in its language, the language of violence and power.

What an amazing actor.
I went into this only being aware it was about Jokers' life.
Completely blew my mind, the emotional depth & complexity of the character Joker, by J. Phoenix. The man is a master actor.
Everyone who has ever felt ignored, poor, down trodden, disrespected, low class, menial, nothing, insignificant, outcast, worthless.... this is a must see film for you.
It is not a bright, happy, happy joy joy film. It is an engrossing film with much emotional depth, pain & irreverence.
I had no idea such films, about such characters, could even be made. Amazing, quite amazing.
Thank you to the makers & to J. Phoenix. Mr. Phoenix, you Sir, have truly created the Joker. I hope there are more films with you, about him. They really need to be of the same calibre please.Incredible. Thank you so much.
It also speaks to today, what is happening in our world, the great financial divide....100/10 A definite must see!!!!",0
Joker,This was a MASTERPIECE,"Joaquin Phoenix was PERFECT, what an actor. I wasn't sure how I would like this movie being a fan of Jack Nicholson's Joker and Heath Ledger's Joker. But Phoenix's Joker was the very best by far, he is an excellent actor and nailed the crazyness and sadness of the character.

Joker,A Masterpiece - not a masterpiece of the superhero genre.,"I saw that this film was highly rated and reviewed and I thought it would be a good movie, but I've been a victim of the ""Superhero genre ratings boost"" before. This movie was absolutely spectacular! The story, the acting, the dialogue, the angles, the score... Joaquin Phoenix was the star and his performance was legendary, but there was no bad acting. All the characters were very believable in their facial expressions, voice intonation, and personality. Of course the movie was disturbing, but it was obviously meant to be. It makes us think about society and what it would be like exist in it if your brain did not function ""normally"".

His performance is mesmerising and amazing. His body, thin and contorted, his face, his eyes... Although he's acting it never feels fake and every inch of his body is telling the story. It could almost be a silent movie and you would still get it.
It is an origins film but it could easily stand on it's own as the close up story of a man's descent into madness.

Joker,Powerful social critique - not some mindless 2 hour distraction,"There's something I just absolutely LOVE about this movie. It totally flips the hero/villain genre on its head. Where do villains come from? Who is the real source of evil? Urban criminals? The destitute? Those envious of the ""success"" of the ""wealthy""? Those ""unwilling"" to ""work hard"" to ""the top""? Or those in power who hoard most of the money and serve corporations before communities/individuals? Those who know how to manipulate the masses, sitting behind desks getting paid an absurdly disproportionate salary while everyone else is discardable and does all the hard work for the least pay.What if those we would vilify are simply products of a broken system? Is there some wisdom in our dark sides? I don't know about you, but this refreshing narrative seems a helluva lot more convincing than anything taught to our children about the nature of ""good"" and ""evil"", ""us"" and ""them"", and the idea that wealth, freedom and happiness is remotely within reach of anyone who has a selfless heart. Yet there's an irony in those who hoard all the money in calling others selfish, in making sure that this capitalistic narrative perpetuates into the next generation.Perhaps all the superhero stories have had it wrong all this time, who the real hero is, and who the real villain is. I love this exploration of our (cultural) shadow.",0
Joker,Masterpiece,"I would say that I agree with most, but not because I conform with the masses but because I enjoy an amazing movie that shows the depths of the actors/actor of the movie! Joaquin did an amazing job of characterizing what we always needed to know about Joker! We know Joker as the ""villain,"" but do we know why or how he became a villain or the bad guy?

This is a movie that will make you think. It's not formulaic in that cheesy Hollywood way. The villain isn't all bad the heroes are flawed if there are any.

Joker,Take a city tour in Joker's Taxi,"Make no mistake, this is not a supervillan superhero movie.

Radical ideas like these can easily be interpreted as grandious avantgarde visions, and mobilize cultish fanatical followers - just as many Jokers thruought our history have demonstrated.Although it is commonly believed that the ""freaks"" come out at night when society falls asleep, we should ask ourselves who the real freaks of this world are - just like Travis Bickle did at the end of Taxi Driver.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Phoenix gives one of the most refreshing performances of the decade.,"The Joker is as breathtaking as ever under Todd Phillips' command. Follow the tragic untold story that begins with a mentally ill comedian who has an unsettling medical condition that makes him suffer from pathological laughter. Embark on this twisted voyage and prepare to be changed forever when you enter a world of misery, disdain and progressive human degradation.This psychological thriller depicts Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to be accepted by a callous society while working as a clown in the freezing cold streets and enduring horrid beatings to keep his job. The only gateway to optimism which helps him maintain his sanity is his lifelong dream and ambition to become a professional comedian. Motivated by the lack of humanity in those around him, he takes a radical turn and joins a dark path that later leads him to becoming the Joker. As from that moment, he can but witness his life being shattered in front of him.Director Todd Phillips, who's best known for his contribution to the comedic side of the cinema with productions like 'The Hangover' trilogy, does a 180 degree turn diving deep into a universe defined by chaos and crime. His latest film is by far the most complex he has ever been involved in. He has previously stated during multiple interviews that the film is not connected to the DCEU and the lack of any other DC comics' characters- besides a young Batman- was probably one of the cleverest ideas for the plot. Doing so, the film gains a certain gravity that is beneficial for the character and is best suited if the Joker is in some way 'separated' from the others.A true piece of art, ""Joker"" is not a typical comic book origin story. It brings so much to the table, paving a new path for future DC adaptations of such accuracy and importance. With a script as unpredictable as its protagonist, it makes it very difficult for audiences to disapprove of Phillips' signature style of co-writing and directing. His work of great precision is centered around essential little details regarding Arthur's life and hidden origins. Phillips will most definitely take centre stage at the Academy Awards this year considering the magnitude of his latest project.Joaquin Phoenix will take the Oscars by storm, thanks to his brave portrayal that is magnificent, as well as oddly exhilarating. Despite being regarded as a bold choice for the part by some, Phoenix gives one of the most refreshing performances of the decade, adding an exciting new edge to the character- sensitivity. Watching him go through pain, loneliness and sorrow triggers emotions of considerable depth that undeniably affect each member of the audience.As soon as he steps into character, his uniqueness is complimented by the original score and cold-toned cinematography. A vintage set reminiscent of ""Taxi Driver"", an eerie soundtrack composed by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir and an epic script put together by a true perfectionist are just a few of the distinctive features of the film. Without a doubt the strongest contender for this year's Academy Award statuette, ""Joker"" tells the disturbing story of a lonely man who lost all his hope while unsuccessfully attempting to fit in a hostile society.",0
Joker,"Wow! Not your usual ""pandering to your ego"" nonsense movie","It makes you feel like you could have gone down the wrong path and empathize with him. There are a ton of would be jokers out there who have been tormented day in and day out, and now you see what happens when one of them has had enough. I used to think Joker was a psychopath. Hardly! He's simply a mentally ill (borderline personality disorder and schizophrenic ) person pushed to the edge. This could almost serve as a foretelling of what could truly happen if we don't try to help people now, who go through this kind of abuse.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,A goddamn masterpiece,"If you're here for a joker story this is not for you. It's a character development movie. The trailer tells you exactly what the movie is about. It's a bout Arthur Fleck becoming the joker. But that's not why it's great. It's great because Hawken Phoenix shows you how a person changes. Everything is rooted in reality and everything that happens is very beliveable not because what is actually happening is believeable but because Arthur believes it to be. This is a great movie that can be interperated to eternity. Director Todd Phillips really went for gold here. He created an amazing universe which this movie can exist in. You don't know if any of the things that happens really happened or if it's just in Arthur's head. Damn everyone should se this movie. I've seen it 3 times in cinema, but I want to see it again. It's just that good. It's art in its truest form.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Powerful and very emotive.,"Probably the most intense film I've watched but maybe for personal reasons.
This film goes deep and can be quite uncomfortable.
The acting is sublime and the cinematography is beautiful but basic.
This film has left an everlasting mark on me, more than any film I've watched before, in good and bad ways.
It'll be a while before I feel comfortable to watch it again (but I will)Some of the low scoring reviews on here are hilarious and look like they're written by 5 year old who'd expected to an Avengers movie.

Joker,One Word Describes this film... Masterpiece,"As a kid growing up Joker was my favorite superhero villain and I always enjoyed seeing the different ways he was portrayed as. That being said, nothing tops this film. Phoenix gives one of the best performances of any film I have ever seen in my life. The writing is absolutely enchanting, dark, tight and extremely engaging. This movie blends psychological thriller, with crime mystery, and overall dark drama. The original score is about as perfectly made for a film as it can possibly get. Whenever it came on I notice the effect of the slow burn increasing suspense my heart rate would increase. The pacing in this movie is just fantastic, it flys by so quickly. I am still taking everything in, the symbolic elements, the meaning of it all and the ending especially the ending which is worth the price of admission. Joker is an extremely dark, and emotionally intense film that really is a lot to take in but it is so well done. Masterpiece!!!! Oscars make sure you watch this film and give it the awards it deserves!!!4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,This movie is hauntingly beautiful.,"When I went to the theatre to see this movie, I was expecting an ordinary movie about a DC villian. But what I saw was way, way more than that. Not only does it show Joker's origin but also shows how society treats people who are a bit different from them. Todd Phillips did an amazing job presenting the little details that show Aurther Fleck's degrading mentality. And the way the music and camera shots emphasises that idea is nothing short of remarkable. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an oscar-winning performance, which made the movie something I will remember for the rest of my life.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Speechless,"To be 100% honest with you guys, I'm writing a review about it right now in the movie theater, right after the movie. And all I can say is that I do not know what to say. And the only question in my mind right now is ""Is this just as good as the Dark Knight, or The Godfather I and II?
Probably not, but it's extremely close. This movie is a great example of how a plot can be so simple, yet so brilliantly done at the same time. The actors, the intense score, and it brings a huge message to today's society by telling us what these so called ""celebrities"" and ""tolerant"" people think of us. The answer is NOTHING. And this is one of many reasons as to why some people go crazy and have their own lives destroyed for other people's entertainment. This movie also does a very good job by showing both sides of the story. The side of the rich, and the side of the poor. You can feel like you are in their shoes and that may be the biggest reason as to why this film is so great. It's realistic and relatable to anyone that has been in this situation. All I can say is, just go watch it in the theaters, and feel the movie for yourself. 98/100, so pretty much flawless.
FYI, for me the only flawless movie ever made is The Godfather I.",0
Joker,It is scary to cheer for the twisted ones,"Let's ignore the phenomenal acting, directing, script, filmography, special effects etc.. You could read about those elements anywhere else.People hate or worship the Joker movie for the same reason, on its superficial level, it glorifies the madmen, the lost, the pillars of capitalism that went astray and as a viewer you might do the same, asking yourself, should I hate the Batman now? No, you are not crazy.It seems that due to non-biological, cultural-related life circumstances, the only way that Arthur Fleck could fulfill himself is to become the Joker, a title that is a part of the movie's strongest underlying, Arthur didn't choose his destiny or his new name and identity, society's strongest did and it seems like there are many people like him or at least people that identify with him as seen in the street of Gotham in the last hour of the movie.I will watch this movie as many times as I watched Pulp Fiction, maybe more, and to think that there is only one significant character in it ( OK maybe De Niro's character is important, but they are all important)",0

His performance in this film as Joker is nothing less than Oscar-worthy. I never thought I would actually be #teamjoker but I am. I'm not a comic reader so of course I never judge a movie based off of that. It was beautifully directed, and pointed a grim picture of what led up to Joker becoming Joker. Twists and turns in every direction. People complained that it took awhile to get going. NOT TRUE. I'm not going to go into a full synopsis of the film because you can read that on the main page. I'm just giving my thoughts. Best film of the year...if not the last 5 years that I have had the pleasure of watching. Movies have been trash lately, so its nice to finally see a gem like this. I'll say it again... OSCAR4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Comic book story telling for adults and intellectuals,"Great performances from all involved. Phillips is awesome with telling the story he wanted and leaving room for interpretation. Expressing his own feelings of society. Conveying it through the tragic story of a person having been beaten by society, now choosing the wrong path. Letting go and giving into his own sick and twisted perspective of the world that treated him so brutally. Returning the hate and anger bestowed upon him. It's sad and wonderful, mischievous and marvelous all at the same time. As an avid comic book, movie , joker, nerd. I felt Joaquin captured his darkness that grew from innocence to violence. His quirks and ticks are exactly what I imagined a live Joker to be, without being cheesy. you see him immerse himself into the madness that lives with the Joker and becomes apart of you as you follow the rabbit hole of the joker. Great stuff, fascinating approach.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Don't see it as a DC film.,"Focus on Arthur. This film is on point with what they want told. I've seen movies that deals with the same idea, but this is just a lecture.A very human society revolves around Arthur and sends him down a path full of conflicts and challenges. To understand why this representation of society can be considered normal, you have to see that this is what our contemporary generation has led to. Everything in this film is normal, normal because it happens and happened. We try to prevent it but its so normalized that it still happens. The problem isn't because of having either mental issues or normal issues, its the fact that we consider them two different things, and forget that the simple concept was to comfort the ones who are going through tough times, and just be there for them.We have opened a network of wrongs and it will keep on breeding more wrongs, until we choose to stop and do something about it.",0
Joker,Unbelievable!,"So I made an account and I am about to give my first ever movie review because of this film.I'm not a critic and Don't know much about the intricacies of cinema but what I can say is this is a damn good movie, I've never watched a movie so perfect before in my life. Honestly I thought this movie was gonna be a flop but I've never been so glad to be wrong.First off this is a terrifyingly real depiction of mental health, I have depression and was nearly in tears multiple times through this movie because I could feel everything that brought the character Arthur down. My favourite thing about this movie is the music, it's a truly scary score that blends well with the overall tone of the movie, every time you hear the music play you get an overpowering sense of dread and fear of what's about to happen. The violence hits hard but isn't over the top and makes you wonder what more this character is capable of. Never before have I seen pacing so perfect in film, it goes from 0 to 100 so slowly yet so quickly making you realise just how serious Arthur's mental state really is. The only thing wrong with this movie is the feeling of needing more!In the end Joker is the best film I have ever seen, it hits hard and leaves you wanting more from Joaquin Phoenix's exceptional performance that haunted my thoughts for days, I've been to see it 3 times now and my thoughts haven't changed. I truly hope to see this iteration of the Joker again in a sequel or even a cameo for any future projects. Hats off to the director and every person involved in this film, it was beyond perfect!",0
Joker,Holy Cesar Romero's Moustache...!,"I always go to the one-star reviews first, as the ten star reviews of movies I like will just echo what I think. I like to see what someone who DIDN'T like the movie has to say - ""OK, convince me"".
The one-star reviews are hilarious - they range from the ""I'm different to everyone else!"" cries for attention to the jealous, possessive moans of those people who think that THEIR character or story has been taken from them and turned into something they don't like. Basically no-one convinced me - I didn't read a single thing that maybe think ""Hmm, maybe they have a point. I hadn't noticed that"".
For this is a perfect movie. Even to a superhero agnostic like me. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix beggars belief - from his physical transformation to the acting turn he puts in. I can't imagine anyone in the history of acting portraying this character to such devastating effect. I won't go on, because, as I said, it has all been said in other reviews - suffice to say that I'll be amazed if another movie tops this in my view in 2019. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might have run it close with 20 minutes shaved off but as it stands, Joker reigns supreme, awards season notwithstanding.
I wondered why the left had took agin this movie, which is no more or less violent than many movies, superhero or no. (And speaking of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I heard someone on a podcast say they walked out when someone started inflicting violence on a woman. (This was a woman intent on slaughtering people, including an unborn child) So you waited till ten minutes from the end to stage your big protest!?) Then I found out. Apparently Todd Phillips said ""Woke culture has killed comedy"". Big mistake! The memo went out. The Hive Mind was apprised. Nothing he did was ever to be favourably reviewed again. Good. More room in the cinema for me.",0

Joker,"He wasn't laughing, he was crying.","Do not expect a fast paced action adventure. This is a different kind of movie to the usual DC/Marvel stuff. This is a pure psychological thriller of epic proportions with incredible character development. It is already one of my favourite all time movies. It is an instant classic which is becoming somewhat of a rarity these days.This is a pure origin story of how Arthur Fleck slowly became The Joker. In fact it isn't really much about The Joker at all, but rightly more about Arthur Fleck. Joaquin Phoenix has given us the most human version of the character yet as he slowly descends into insanity. If he doesn't win an oscar for this then just scrap the awards altogether.It really raises empathy about mental health issues, what it is like struggling day to day living with the loneliness and stigmas of poor mental health within a cruel heartless society, and for Arthur who we learn also has empathy too for the underdog. This is definitely not a comic book flick. I am no huge Batman fan, but I am now a big fan of The Joker. I left the cinema feeling that I learned something new about myself.

Joker,Todd Phillips just graduated to the big leagues,"Looking at this from a business perspective...the career move that director Todd Phillips made was brilliant. It was a brilliant move but I wasn't totally certain it would make for a brilliant film - I wasn't sure if he had it in him. As he's stated in recent interviews, he hit a point where he felt he could no longer make crude comedies for an American audience, which is what he's been known for (The Hangover trilogy, Old School, etc), and I feel that completely. So where do you go from there? Considering comic book movies are one of the only types of movies that get large production budgets in 2019, he takes an iconic comic book character, takes one of the most intense and interesting A-list actors we have working, and instead of making another carbon-copy, commercialistic, and fully forgettable CGI-fest full of fart jokes and giant robots getting knocked over, he makes a movie with some actual psychological depth! What a way to work around this troubled system! One must generally adapt in order to capitalize.As far as the film itself, I knew Phillips and Phoenix would create something entertaining, but I could not have expected the sheer masterpiece they pulled off. From every angle... the writing, the directing, the editing, the photography, the pacing - it's all impeccable and I am beyond impressed. There's not a dull moment and every single scene plays an important role in the tension-building and the unfolding of every little plot element. And, of course, the acting... this could be very well be the greatest performance of Joaquin Phoenix's career, which is a colossal statement considering his mountain of phenomenal films, and the fact that he might be my #1 of this era. Literally every shot where Phoenix is on the screen disperses an outpour of complex emotions - never just one, always a smorgasbord, like when you've eaten half an eighth of mushrooms and they've just begun kicking in, and you feel entirely overwhelmed. There were more psychological twists than I was expecting and they had me pretty stirred up as they piled atop each other.As far as all the negative press around this movie, I find it all almost entirely off base and misdirected. Sarcastic comments like ""Finally, a movie for angry white men who can't get everything they want""... as if there has never been any other films about any psychopaths, maniacs, criminals, or serial killers who also happen to be white men, which have been praised endlessly for decades? Simultaneously we have oodles of people praising shows like MINDHUNTER, with no negative press, while JOKER is getting attacked. They are both about the same thing...psychotic serial killers. That's what this is... an intricate character study about a blossoming psychopath and killer, which also happens to include a multitude of themes that can be aligned with societal obstacles we are currently facing in reality. Yes, you put yourself in the villain's shoes, and you feel fractions of the pain that villain is feeling, but the point is not to GLORIFY or CELEBRATE such darkness, but rather to wallow in it just long enough to feel disrupted then get the hell out of there and go back to your normalcy. JOKER has a lot of heart, a lot of blood pumping through it's veins, and a working brain too - it's actually the most human movie I have seen this year, with the most depth.I could say a lot more, but I will wrap up instead. I had a smile plastered across my face for 75% of this movie, as I was constantly blown away by either some element of what I was seeing. The other 25% I was scared, sad, or excited - but I was never bored. Not for a second. Every MOMENT was stimulating, and meticulously crafted. This is actually one of the only truly masterful movies I have EVER seen based off of a comic book character - not only is it special in that sense, but it's also boosted Todd Phillips to the league of legendary filmmakers. I'm curious to see if this is a chance one-off, or if Phillips will carry on as a dramatic filmmaker, after going above and beyond with this one. 10 out of 10, in my opinion.",0

Joker,Phenomenal acting. Joachim Phoenix can make even Gotham feel sad,"I don't think it is a coincidence that Robert de Niro was an actor in this movie. Joker plays more like Taxi Driver than any movie I've seen. The same slow descent into madness for a disillusioned and ignored man at the edge of society.I didn't find the film political at all. Because what Phoenix did I felt for his character at a visceral level, beyond good, evil and morality. The entire movie is a joke that only some people get it. The incel thing, for example, was hilarious in retrospect: frightened first worlders trying to instantly put a label on the people that they feared most and needed support more. The exact same reaction as portrayed in the film. The story in this is very personal, in a social context that becomes a constant buzz that fades in the background.If there is any word that could describe Joker is uncomfortable. It's two hours of feeling the suffering of the main character, even as he breaks and does unconscionable things. You can't not root for him. You can't condone it. You can't not be sad. And in the end, when I was thinking this is a great movie but has nothing to do with the DC comics, it ties in the Batman classic storyline with such ease that I couldn't help shivering thinking on what Batman's story would be in this universe of burning sadness.Bottom line: great acting and really fresh ideas that work together perfectly. It's a very adult film, though, and not for everybody.",0
Joker,Best movie of the year,"Yes, sir.
Joker develops the true meaning of ""character"".
Character in Latin is a synonym for persona, ie ""person"".
But what would a soulless person be?
Probably a caricature.
Something that only exists on a canvas.That's exactly the typical Joker from Batman movies.
A creation that can only be found on a movie screen.
For sure, it's a captivating character, but soulless.
Nobody knows why he is a villain in fact.
In Batman movies, Joker is just there committing crimes, like a puppet.Not here.
What makes a person a villain?
How to give a soul to such a villain?
In real life, a psychopath/ sociopath is a natural born killer or he is shaped like that by his own world.
The proposal of this movie is to give a compelling life to a villain character.Undoubtedly, this is the best movie of 2019: great screenplay, awesome direction and a perfect acting of a soulful character.",0

Joker,The Pranker,"Dude so this movie is what I would call good. Like there is so much plot in it and it gets intense which makes it intresesting and thot-provoking. Literally though two scantily clad females tried feeling me up during the film and I was like ""dude NOT cool save it for the battle bus"". But yeah anyway so Wakeen Feenix does a nice job playing the joker I mean the pranker I mean Arthur. He's got issues and he ain't afraid to show it. But yeah dude so I'm watching the movie and I was really just thinking the whole time like wow this movie is good. Like when Batman appears i thought oh my god this is like in Godzilla king of the monsters which I saw with the boys in imax on May 31st during the scene where the guy rides gkdzilla's titanic pecker. But yeah and also joker dances but I sat next to these two DUMB kids of dark descent The second time I viewed the movie and I had a throwdown with them cause they were laughing during my movie. Just goes to show how no one respects cinemenama anymore. But yeah dude the movie was trash no JK it was epic and I won't see it again.13 out of 33 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Superb. Serious USA cinema is back!,"Joker: Brilliant. Mesmerising. 10/10 Brecht & Havel would be pleased. A satire on the stand-up insanity, Marvel movie dross, TV comedy hosts on late night tv, corrupt America, the contributions of Robin Williams, Jim Carey & Charlie Chaplin to civilisation, with references to Taxi Driver, Midnight Cowboy & Network. Serious film representing good theatre and writing is back....I hope. Phoenix is superb. I did not want to take my eyes off him in case I missed a facial twitch or expression. He builds on Heath Ledger's Joker and takes it to the stratosphere and beyond. It will be too close to home for a lot of Americans who don't want to face up to obscene wealth, homelessness, mental illness, poor medical cover and gun insanity. But see it.....it's marvellous!

Joker,A Beautifully Twisted Masterpiece of Cinema,"I had high expectations for this film, but it completely destroyed them. This film is about The Joker, but in my opinion more than anything, it's about mental illness. It's about people who feel alone and are angry at the world. The movie shows how Arthur Fleck turns into The Joker, and it's a stunning watch, filled with incredible acting, directing, writing, music, and cinematography. A truly stunning work of art that I won't forget for a long time.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Oscar winning movie!,"A crude adaptation of a remarkable comic character. Phoenix embodies a person with a mental illness in an extraordinary adaptation, the audience feels identify with the Joker, you feel sorry, you feel his strougle. The film is a critic to today's society, where sick person are forgotten and, moreover, expected to behave as normal people. The adaptation is not a retelling of a comic story, is an interpretation of an iconic character based on many comic stories.

Joker,A psychological masterpiece,"I'll try to keep this brief. This is without doubt the best psychological thriller ever made. For people who have experienced MH problems or understand what it is like to feel isolated and trapped with over thinking, coupled with dillusional thoughts, the film could not have told the story any better. The links with the batman story and the empathy you feel towards joker (due to the brilliant acting and screenplay) as his life spirals out of control leaves you understanding the choices he makes in some way. Will definitely watch again soon !5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,An amazing raw criticism to modern civilization and mental health stigma,"The movie is masterfully crafted, it certainly makes every movie goer reflect on what they have just seen. What they have seen is a mentally ill man, and the suffering he goes through after being marginalized by every modern institution, including the government and his family. The movie plays with the viewers emotions by making them empathize with the Arthur Fleck and then watching him make unforgivable actions.

Joker,"A mesmorizing character study, with a brilliant performance from Pheonix","As you've probably heard by now, Joker is a comic book film unlike anything we've ever seen before. It chooses to focus on it's iconic lead character in a very down to earth, dark and twisted story that mostly stays far away from any sort of storyline found in the Batman comics. This film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who slowly descends into madness and revolts against the world around him.
Joaquin Phoenix is incredible in this. He portrays Arthur in with so many subtle movements and expressions that makes Arthur feel like a real person. Phoenix even stamps his own name on Joker's laugh, ensuring it stands out from everyone else. He's in every single scene, and he eats up every minute of the runtime.
This character is incredibly complex, and every scene portrays his descent into madness. It will be a film that will likely require multiple viewings to catch every detail. The film can be slow but every scene is important to Arthur's breakdown and by the end of the film, you will see a character that has become completely full circle. It's incredible to watch in a movie that will be remembered for a very, very long time.",0

Phoenix rocked the whole jokers character itself. The story of the movie is satisfying for the audience and indeed the dialogue, comic timings, cinematography, score and all other.
Movie starts with joker already getting a bad day. The story becomes more and more intense as the movie rolls on. We can feel the tense and the good thing about the movie is its Gotham city's atmosphere.. Its chilling and interesting to watch the development of jokers character till the second half.
And oh dear the 2nd half of the movie is mesmerizing and top of the game.
Goosebumps all over when phoenix becomes joker .
The dance and laughs we can't miss .
Everytime joker laughs there is something for the audience

It is as if the majority of the people writing such reviews haven't even seen the movie themselves. No this movie does not invoke or persuade anarchist violence, nor is it meant to be the happy/feel-good type that many super hero movies portray. This is a movie of the devolution of man, who happens to fit into the comic book fiction world of Gotham. Don't bring your children to see this, it is not meant for them - it is meant for those mature enough to understand an amazing character study that Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix place on the big screen. This movie was one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in years, one that kept me engrossed from beginning to end without falter. Please do yourself a favor and see this movie, and don't read the critics' reviews. They're just degenerates looking for a big hit headline. Joker is 10/10, up there with the likes of Taxi Driver.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Brilliant as both a comic book movie and a stand-alone movie.,"I've never seen a movie (with the possible exception of The Force Awakens and The Incredibles 2) to be as hyped as this with both good and bad things emanating from that. Ever since the first trailer came out in April, I've been waiting to see it. I knew that this wouldn't be like any other comic book movie I'd seen up to that point (I've yet to see Logan and Watchmen). And indeed, from the trailers it looked like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which also star Robert De Niro. Even still, Joker perfectly encapsulates everything about the character. The Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate. The movie gives a believable and more than fitting backstory for the Joker. If not than you could look at it as the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) just an unfortunate and deluded man with aspirations of being a comedian who endured one too many kicks in the teeth. It is a comic book movie but more dark and gritty than any I've ever seen, including The Dark Knight. I often don't like the way that DC assumes that since the Dark Knight trilogy the only path to success is by way of the dark route, without actually taking the time to do it right. Joker does it right. And with an R rating it's not for kids.",0
Joker,The Rise of the Clown Prince,"The hype is real ladies and gentlemen, this is easily one of the finest films I have ever watched. This isn't just another CGI fueled movie with a superficial plot and big explosions trying to make up for it.
This isn't a mindless superhero, ahem, super villain movie. This is a deep and disturbing character study of what could happen to a person under highly excruciating, albeit, very realistic circumstances. To say that Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck was superb, would be an understatement. He has a way to convey his character's emotions on a level that will make you feel for him and equally disturb you. This isn't your typical ""villain-falls-in-a-tub-of-acid"" origin story, and the fact that society or lack thereof can have such an impact and break a man in such a way, makes it that much more terrifying to watch.
""Joker"" is sure to provoke some interesting talks long after leaving the theater. A must watch.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Watched this movie 3 times already before Sunday (opening weekend)...,"The viewer follows the life of the mentally ill Arthur Fleck where he struggles to stay sane in a society that has collectively cast him out.
The intricacy of Arthur's progressing insanity is one that will be remembered for years to come. The film is raw and remarkably truthful about the difficulties the mentally ill face in society. Arthur struggles to overcome his ""negative thoughts"" and become a successful stand-up comedian, while also discovering the truth of his mental illness and origin as well.
As the film progresses you realize that you're watching Arthur slowly lose his mind, despite his efforts to remain sane and reach for help. This is created in a heart breaking yet beautiful way, where you are left understanding Arthur and the decisions he comes to make by the finale.I loved this film and it may easily be my favorite of all time. The cinematography, the writing, the acting, and everything is damn near perfection. I am amazed on how Joaquin Phoenix was able to carry the film on his own and deliver such an incredible performance. Arthur is the epitome of character development in this film and I don't think that alone does this movie justice.
By the end of the film I was left with my jaw wide open; I just couldn't believe how the intricacy on Arthur's inner battles led so smoothly into the creation of the Joker. Everything in this film is original and I encourage everyone to go watch it. You might want to keep the kids at home for this one though.
If I could give it higher than a 10 I would.",0
Joker,"I'm no critic, but...","Joaquin is unbelievably amazing. It links the DC Universe together so well. Joker is the reason Batman is alive!

Joker,Go watch the Movie for an Unbridled Performance from Phoenix. And for the Filmmakers who had the Determination with go through with a Disturbingly Brilliant Ventures.,"Never Did I thought there would be a redefining role for this character after Ledger. Phoenix puts his heart and soul into the psyche of a man who has little to lose, who's constantly at odds with what the society considers Norm.He tries to life by its rules, only to constantly find his back to the wall. Abused, Put down, Shaken up, Underappreciated.
It is only when he sheds his tattered concepts of morality, does the world start making sense to him. and his ascension spells chaos to the world.Joaquin Phoenix is notorious telling us stories not only through dialogue but also his Body language. And here we see, how as the strings holding him tied are cut one after the other, the timid, unsure and pitiable Arthur transforms into this confident reality he built for himself. Into what he sees as his destiny.There is no doubt that the movie is a vehicle for the character study of Arthur Fleck's descent into Madness. or as he sees it, his 'enlightenment'. the world, the characters, the narrative, even the colors and environment are set in a way to accentuate it.Make no mistake, This is not a Marvel brand of 'family Friendly' entertainment. Definitely not one you take the kids to. The actions and themes explored are chilling in how close they are to reality. They are scenes you cannot/should not be seeing, but will regardless. And it does an excellent job of making you squirm in your seats. As it should.The story towards the end overstays its welcome a bit. Without spoiling much, there were some parts where i thought 'this is when & how the story should wrap' but it kept pulling on. And at least one scene related to Bruce's origin seemed more like shoehorn. All in all, go and watch for Phoenix's Spellbinding performance and story with a heart of Dark Depravity.",0

Joker,Smile and put on a happy face,"There is no reason why Phoenix's elaborately backstoried Joker shouldn't be as powerful as Heath Ledger's mysterious, motiveless, originless Joker in The Dark Knight. But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn't weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn't forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.Final rate : Masterpiece.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A True Masterpiece,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, in this jaw-dropping masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It proves to be more than just a comic book villains backstory. 'Joker' meticulously captures the gradual decline of one man's mental health, and shines light on the subject of mental health in general. There are points where you begin to sympathize with the madman. Despite some of the terrible acts he happily commits, you find yourself rooting for him which leads you to question your own morality. The world has viciously beaten this man down, and this is only the beginning of his retaliation.This is, without a doubt, Phoenix's best performance so far. He carries the entire movie flawlessly, and leaves you with a lot to talk about afterwards. The brilliant method actor ensures that people will feel this characters pain, and does not disappoint for one second. Robert De Diro, another brilliant method actor, gives a fine performance as Aurthor Fleck's favorite comedy talk show host, Murray Franklin. Though he's only in the movie for roughly 10-15 minutes total, he does a very well job at depicting a phony, belligerent, television personality. Brett Cullen also gives a fine performance as the billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, and has a part in Jokers madness.The word 'masterpiece' should never be thrown around lightly. It's a term we use to describe an outstanding, almost perfect, piece of art. There are only so many films that can be considered 'masterpieces'. Rarely do we ever see a flawless movie, especially this day in age. With that being said, it is hard to NOT consider 'Joker' a masterpiece. Every scene is just as important as the next, every actor delivers a wonderful performance, and Todd Phillips does an outstanding job directing the villains transformation. 'Joker' absolutely deserves a 10/10, and nothing short of that. This movie holds a mirror up to society; it should make you question what part society takes in one's slow drift into madness. This is very relevant to today, and is a perfect example of why something like this needs to be addressed and taken seriously. Everyone needs to see this movie. Again, it will be talked about for many years to come, and could very well be considered one of the greatest drama/thrillers of all time.",0
Joker,Breathtaking,"I am floored, humbled, awestruck and amazed.
This movie is in one word....brilliant.

A cinematic masterpiece.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,To call this a 'Psychological Thriller' is an insult,"To claim that this film is anything other than a masterpiece is a claim that is tainted by a contradictory outlook on how mental illness should be portrayed/addressed by the media.You will ALWAYS have people who dislike films like this; to make a film this potent and powerful is to make a film that is going to be extremely controversial, and I'm sure that is exactly what the writers and directors foresaw in the making of this film.That being said, you can FEEL their vision with every single frame of this absolute masterpiece, and Phoenix not only gives the best performance of his life, but also takes the character of the Joker to a place we have never seen him before, and he takes society with him.The question of Phoenix vs Ledger will be no doubt raging within the coming months and years after this film's release. The fact is that the question is void because of the fact that they portray COMPLETELY different aspects of the Joker's persona, and both portray is masterfully. However, Phoenix's portrayal goes much deeper than Ledger's at least on an emotional level, which is all I shall say in that regard.The visceral assault of emotions I experienced during this film was unlike anything I've ever felt or experienced in my life. To portray such a traditionally psychotic character in such an emotional, and even sympathetic way, depending on your outlook, is an unbelievable feat.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and of course that is okay; people and critics are going to dislike this film, that is their opinion. But to deny that this film is anything other than a masterpiece would sadly be false, and I absolutely applaud everyone involved in this absolute work of art.",0

Joker,A different but equally brilliant portrayal,"If Ledger showed us the deranged, criminal mastermind that is the joker than Joaquin told us how he got there. The journey is darker and more disturbing and the result is a movie that is so good, so epic, so raw that you walk out thinking, I can't watch that again.
In that way it really is like Taxi Driver, and realistically with what the film is trying to portray I can't help but feel that's a respectful response.
A lot of really satisfying nods to numerous Joker portrayals, in writing, screenplay, soundtrack and in the nuances of Joaquins portrayal. But the Dark Knight nods are the ones that really get the excitement up whilst avoiding any cheesy CGI and glad to see no sequal or spinoff platform was built in to the story.Truly a masterpiece.... that maybe you should only see once....8 out of 19 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Read carefully.,"I can see how a privileged normie will see this and think ""oh no, this will inspire the lower, unprivileged class to be violent towards us"" but if you have a few brain cells to scrape together, as well as some empathy you can totally understand what this was about - and it ain't that.A sweet, though mentally struggling, mentally abused man trying to be a light in the darkness of society is only getting punished for it until he's unwillingly pushed into things he would never possibly want to do, such as cause harm.An invisible man becomes visible. There's plenty of us who are invisible, and plenty of you who have your brainless followers and think you're the center of the universe. Even if you're not that famous you're still arrogant enough to consider yourself special because you're in Hollywood. How could you possibly understand this movie?This movie was perfectly timed in an age where mainstream media and Hollywood celebrities who smell their own far7s all day and virtue signal on Twitter while knowing nothing about life outside of a mansion - daily demonize what they view as lower class, and inexplicably, men in general. Especially emotionally fragile men like Joker.
So I see why some of the same mainstream media grasped for straws in order to twist this masterpiece into one of their little ""controversies"" in order to deter the same people they hate from watching a movie, finally, one movie, they could possibly relate to - because the struggle to survive and be kind while being deemed a low class freak is portrayed scary realistic.",0
Joker,Amazing Movie. Brilliant!,"Once you leave the theatre, you will absolutely feel it was yi=our money's worth. This cannot be said to be just a movie. It has elements to it that can be seen in our society even today. How a person with mental illness is laughed by the society even if there is nothing he can do about it, and also about the divide between the poor and the rich. The directing was simply brilliant and captured the darkness of the mind of the joker, The stroy even if it may be at slow at first will get better as the movie goes on. The story is dark but at the same time has scenes with comedy in it. It also has shocking bits to it which makes it an absolutely brilliant movie. The Acting was also amazing.

There were so many that I couldn't ignore it, I started watching the movie thinking there was a possibility I would be bitterly disappointed.In the end I was delighted to discover it is indeed a masterpiece, a fantastic piece of cinematic history, one of the most enjoyable movies I have watched in a long time. The acting is just superb, the story excellent, the musical score was quite haunting and the directing was exquisite - quite simply 10 out of 10.How could so many people not enjoy it? The only explanation I can come up with it that perhaps they went to the cinema expecting a Batman movie, or hoping that it would be a CGI-packed action movie like the typical DC comic movie. If that's what you were expecting then I can understand the disappointment but to give it just 1 star because you felt stupid or foolish is really unfair.This is an incredibly compelling origin story with some sensational acting that deserves every Oscar it wins (which I am sure it will) but to those of you expecting a standard Batman or Ironman flick or if you're hoping for Wonder Woman to jump out from behind a car then you will be disappointed. It is a fantastic movie.",0
Joker,Film Review: Joker,"Having watched this last night, I am in a trance. This film was absolutely brilliant, but it is not for the faint hearted. Joaquin Phoenix does the best Joker we've seen since The Dark Knight and he must receive Best Actor for this. This film is not so gory it should be an 18, but it is particularly gory. In one scene, a man is stabbed with scissors and his head is bashed against a wall. The aftermath is disgusting. Strong language occurs throughout the film. Beware, this is NOT a superhero movie. This film is about mental health and it is not in any way about the DC universe.

Joker,Phenomenal!,"I loved every minuet of Joker. I was extremely happy when I found out that we would be solely looking into the Jokers character and identifying what makes him tick and what causes his characteristics. Now before i go into what I loved about the cinematography, i need to say Joaquin Phoenix played the character exceptionally. His laughter to his delivery to his weight loss, Joaquin really made the character convincing and mesmerized me. It's amazing how we feel sympathy for someone who killed people and see the antagonistic as the protagonist in a way. Furthermore, Joaquin got the Joker's laugh on point. Not only is the laugh pretty psychotic, but we wince at the pain he goes through when he start to cough uncontrollably.Moving onto the cinematography Lawrence Sher did a amazing job with his colour correction, his composition to his use of semiotic theory. The use of the grungy dark green and dimmed black really conveys the tone of the film. Especially in the bathroom scenes and the subway shots. However, the composition was the aspect that really blew me away. Lawrence really used his surroundings to not only get rid of negative space and make the film look beautiful, but he is fantastic a making the viewers eyes look at a certain part of the screen.I could go on and on about this film, however, being a young film student I don't feel like I am in a position where i can criticize this films cinematography or direction. However, if i would have to give one improvement it would be certain tweaks to parts of the script. Mainly when it comes to his family relationship. I would of loved to have seen more of that.A amazing film and a must watch!",0
Joker,Brilliant,"I was hesitant to watch this film as the reviews I read weren't good. It was described as ""artsy"" and ""slow"". My guess now is that those reviews were written by toddlers. This film is nothing like the typical Batman movies however it still has great action scenes. In my opinion, this film is far better than the typical superhero/villain movies. How it subtly focuses on mental health issues is just wonderful. People like myself can relate in a deeper way than the average movie goer. As for the acting...wow, blown away. Joaquin has shown many times hes a great actor but his talent in this film is unmatched. It pushed him to the very top of my favorites list. If you love a good story, great characters, intense action and a film that makes you think, you will not be disappointed!3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Joker - Movie Review,"I knew that I loved Joker when I first saw it, but I have now seen it three times and it just keeps getting better with every rewatch. Obviously, the shining achievement of this film is Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. There isn't really much I can say about his performance that hasn't already been said, but I would be completely shocked and a little upset if he doesn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.Phoenix perfectly embodied the role of a man who was beaten down and broken by the society that he was being forced to live in, and we as an audience were able to completely understand where he was coming from. That doesn't mean that we approve of his actions, but all of the best villains are the people with a backstory that we can understand, and this absolutely happened in Joker.The supporting actors all played their parts as well, and there wasn't a single weak link to the film. I am shocked that Todd Phillips went from directing films like The Hangover and Due Date, to Joker. I never knew he has this level of talent within him, but now I am genuinely excited to see where he will go from here. Having rewatched Joker a few times now, Philips scatters breadcrumbs throughout the film that I was able to pick up when revisiting it, and he also pays attention to loads of insignificant details which I loved.The score was also phenomenal, and added to the tone of the picture. I also really liked the cinematography, because every frame had care put into it and was able showcase exactly what Phillips was going for. I loved everything about Joker, and consider it to definitely be one of the best comic book movies ever made, even if it doesn't go about it in the traditional sense.Plain and simple, Joker is a masterpiece, and it just gets better the more I watch it.SCORE: 100%",0
Joker,Love hate relationship,Love this movie ... but I hate it. It's about mental illness. It's not a joker movie. It breaks my heart but it's so good! I won't ever watch it again tho it's so sad3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0
Joker,Send in the clown...,"Last night I finally got to watch this film. 'The Joker' is thrilling from beginning to end. This take on the very iconic character was just so intriguing. Arthur is such a fully realized character. His story is both a tragedy and a comedy. The movie follows this character from the misunderstood tragic clown to his descent into madness. And Joaquin Phoenix captures all of this really well with his Oscar-worthy performance. He's one hell of an actor. This movie works so well because of him.Yes, there are a lot of similarities and homages to several films like ' Taxi Driver' but I think Todd Phillips and everyone did such an amazing job making this movie so it stands on its own. The score by composer Hildur Guonadottir was terrific as well.I think a lot of people can relate to a character like Arthur. He's the forgotten man. The weirdo. Cast aside by society. No one gave a crap about him and it's a real shame. The system failed him and many others. Mental illness is such a big problem in society and I feel we all need to be better at understanding and being supportive. You never truly know what's going on in someone's mind. We as a society create monsters. A person can only take so much until they just snap. And Arthur definitely snapped. His message may not be entirely wrong and we can all agree with him on some points, but his actions certainly were wrong. Send in the clown...",0

Joker,Wonderful and sad,"Joker is hard to watch at times. I actually cringed a few times. It is so well acted by Phoenix. The setting is dark dingy and feels sick like the character. I liked getting the back story of the man that becomes Joker and his sad descent into madness. His lonesomeness, metal instability and the lack of compassion that people showed to him all make it understandable. Although he is a violent maniac in the end- I was almost glad to see he had found his purpose and was finally liked.

Joker,Damn good movie,"I expected little with it being attached to DC.
I was wrong and wrong again. This the best 'origin story' movie I've ever seen. The movie did a good job of following his descent into madness and gave him sympathy.
Of course some folks will not like this but to me it makes the character complete. Total hate for the Joker would make him one dimensional and that would be typical DC. Hey Heather!

Joker,"Very dark, violent and beautiful...","I don't think enough critics understand the concept and the style of this movie because they thought the movie was too dark and too violent, If you see the reviews for this movie, don't listen to them, watch it! Because ""Joker"" is one of the best comic book films I've seen in 2019 since ""Endgame"".
Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as the Joker, everytime you hear him laugh, you know you're in for a great time, Robert De Niro is also in this movie and that's exciting to hear about. The cinematography, the score, the acting, the atmosphere of Gotham, everything about this movie is amazing.
I did heard some people talk about of how the movie's similar to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"", and yes I could see that, and to me it makes me want to watch ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time, I never seen ""The King of Comedy"" though, but I might later.
Although, what people are most talking about is the level of violence in this movie, and yes I know it could very controversial to hear about and it could inspire a person to do it, and it happened before, but come on guys, It's JUST a movie, everything about the violence is set-up behind the production.
Overall, ""Joker"" is an amazing film with beautiful cinematography, amazing score and an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, This is easily one of the best comic book films I've ever seen.Score: 10/10 ---- Highly Recommended",0

Joker,"Top contender for 9th Feb, 2020","So Joker is now at #26 in the list of top rated movies of all time in IMDb at the time of writing this. After watching the movie I critically examined the top 25 movies that are ahead of Joker right now, and concluded a few can actually go ahead of this - a very few. And movies like The Dark Knight, The Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club and a few others may not be eligible for sitting ahead of Joker.All in all, Joker now onwards should be synonym of Joaquin Phoenix. With due respect, the age is Heath Ledger is gone. Joaquin cries, laughs, bleeds, runs, sweats, sings, dances and kills. Gives everything to create a towering character in the history of cinema, and in the history of movie acting. In each frame you can feel the pain of the deprived and dispossessed man. In each frame you can witness how a simple and chaste man can be transformed into a villain by the torments of the society when all of his tries go in vain.And finally we must congratulate Todd Phillips for this masterpiece and thank him for creating an eternal character here.92nd Academy Awards:Best actor: Joaquin Phoenix

Joker,What doesn't love you simply makes you ...stranger!!!,"Hello there ...Todd Phillip's Joker is here to hit you with a smile stronger than a thousand fists,A realistic depiction of an iconic Cartoon character , strongly influenced by masterpieces of the past , If you were amazed by movies such as Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and King of Comedy , then you are in for a treat , but does it stop there?Absolutely not, Phillips managed to combine landmark storylines from the myths cartoon artists gave us, such as Alan Moore's The Killing Joke with classic cinema masterpieces in modern society while he takes us in a deep dive of society's everyday problems and psychology, he dresses his movie with an outstanding soundtrack by talented young composer Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir (she also gave us the score to drama miniseries Chernobyl ),and a colorful cinematography, creating something new and sadistically beautiful because you can't help yourself but to fall in love with the main character although you know he is the bad guy ... or is he not?It's already a classic, and I dare to say a landmark because I believe is going to be a great influence for future movies,of course Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal stands as one of the greats in cinema history , is Joker sane or crazy , is he a product of society or his twisted imagination, a criminal mastermind or a straw dog? maybe he is all of the above ... this movie will leave you with mixed feelings and a lots of thoughts ... it gets deep in you and makes you think what makes us human ... is it a smile always true , is it happiness ? and yet no matter how hurt you are there is always a rainbow after the storm ...",0

Joker,I just get the joke.,Joker is a movie in a guy's head. He makes us pity him and that was the joke. (I just get the joke),0
Joker,Rated R for realistic,"I remember watching batman in the 90s, even the cartoon was darker and more emotionally compelling then the most modern superhero movie franchises. The back stories of the villains painted a picture into their behavior. Most were tormented in some way or had some twisted take on justice. In some ways they were initially right. Batman wouldn't just try to stop them, he'd try to help them.As for the movie itself, as others have said haunting and compelling. It takes the simple concept we've seen to have forgotten above and blasted us with reality. Their are sad and broken people all around us.If this was a true story he probably would have just ended up as a homeless beggar. Instead we get a fairy tale villain. So you don't have to keep feeling sorry for him. But the movie does a good enough job to keep that in the back of your mind whether you realize it or not.If they could achieve this level with Clay Face, Gator Guy etc that would be epic. Enjoy!",0
Joker,Joachin Phoenix is worth every penny,"I've watched most of Joachin Phoenix films, most have been wierd and underwhelming, Even though underneath it all he's obviously a very talented actor. I've always felt he's just picked not so great films to act in with not so great story lines or dialogue. Joachin Phoenix shines throughout this movie and truly shows what a very talented actor he is. I actually cant imagine anyone else to have played Joker,too even remotely as well as Joachin Phoenix.This film is triumphant and although I did go in expecting it to be a decent film, as it had pretty good reviews. I was gripped right from the beginning to the end with some edge of the seat scenes and it was a lot better than I was expecting to be honest. The storyline his character were good also, but it would not have worked so well with anyone else playing Joker. The very sad part of this film,like being let down by society is actually true as I've seen it first hand. I'm not talking about the USA, but the United Kingdom and it's getting worse as were sadly turning into an I'm alright jack society. Where mostly people just think about themselves which makes this film even more real to me. Anyway I'm rambling ,I actually agree that this film is a masterpiece and I'm not a fan usually of DC films. I think this film will be Joachin Phoenix's greatest success story as I cant see him topping this purely raw but superb movie. It would be nice now to see another Batman movie vs the Joker maybe Christian Bale as Batman and of course Joachin as Joker. I think that would be another film worth watching. Go watch it and enjoy an acting performance of a lifetime.",0

Joker,The Broken Clown Prince,"When I first saw the 'Joker' in ""The Dark Knight"" I fell in love with the character, because of his somewhat correct motives and the way he thinks. I had never seen a character like him before in any movie, which made it so new and refreshing to watch. When the ""Joker"" movie was announced I was stunned. Especially when I noticed Joaquin Phoenix was going to take on the role of the Joker. An actor that in my opinion is one of the greatest - if not the best - performers of the 20th century. Sr. Phoenix is so good at taking on roles that most people wouldn't want to take on because of how horrifying, haunting or psychologically difficult they are. As someone who absolutely loved Heath Ledger (may he rest in peace) as the Joker, I was extremely curious about Joaquin's performance when I was waiting in the theater for the movie the start. I was not disappointed, not at all. Sr. Phoenix performed beyond my expectations. To me it felt like Joaquin actually transformed 'himself' into the character which gave the personage a very realistic and terrifying touch. The story allowed this character to feel even more real, by placing him in a world that could - if not already - be real and making him face obstacles that people might actually be facing daily. As if there is a deeper message and meaning behind the story. It is very difficult to describe my thoughts on this movie, but that's what so great about it. It allows you to think for yourself. At the end of the movie, every single person in the theater probably thought of a different ending or reason for certain keypoints in the film. It wasn't just a casual ""good guy bad guy"" story, not at all.I rate this movie 10/10 because to this day I do not seem to be able to sum up any negative points in this movie. I enjoyed it, I will enjoy it many more times and I highly recommend you to give it a shot as well if you haven't yet - because it might just change your whole perspective on cinematography.",0

It's rare for a film to live up to its hype, even rarer for it to surpass it and my God didn't this movie just do that. The grit and feel of the film is something that is a wonder to watch with tremendous storytelling and what is a truly astounding performance from Phoenix. His portrayal of the Joker was quite rightly always going to be compared to Heath Ledgers magnificent portrayal and I, along with many many others, suspected it could not be done again. How wrong I was, Joaquin is truly unbelievable in this film, you can actually believe he has completely gone insane, just broken from the crooked system we live in. It is so strange how relatable the character is as anyone who has fell on hard times probably has gone through struggles that no one deserves and highlights so many problems in our modern day society.

Joker,Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar,"I am not a fan of Batman movies (though I have watched them all) and I really hated the Dark Knight movie. And the reason I hated it was the reason everyone loved it. It was Heath Ledger. His acting was the epitomy of abnoxious. It was sooo annoying to watch him. But then he died and everyone praised his acting even more.
I am not a fan of Joker either. When I saw this movie's trailer I was like Oh my here we go again. Another annoying movie.
I was not supposed to watch it. But after all the success and the reviews I decided to watch it, not in order to enjoy it but in order to see what everyone was talking about and have my own opinion.
I was shocked because instead of watching a mehh movie I watched a masterpiece.
I really do not understand why many governments banned this movie for people under 18 (it is not scary or gory) and I do not understand why people expected mass shootings or things like that.
This is JUST A MOVIE. Not scarier than other movies I have watched. It is a movie about people with mental illnesses and about people who are neglected by their country and authorities.
But what makes this movie really worth watching is Joaquin Phoenix. I like him as an actor but I never thought he was THAT good. He is excellent.",0

Joker,The type of movie that changes society,"Phenomenal. best movie I've seen in a long time. Never thought anyone would be able to play joker better than heath ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. It's not a comic book story per say but an actual story of a man who's on the cusp of insanity and society just pushes him over the edge. It just seemed real, like i could fully imagine someone going through this very thing. I walked out and thought that a movie like that could start a revolution in real life. I could see people buying into and if i recall, some of the people protesting in Hong Kong were dressing up as joker as part of the protest. Not to overstate it, but I don't know that a movie has ever really touched me like that before.

Joker,cool,"It is impossible to characterize this film otherwise. This is a work of art, thought out in detail and filmed. The film can not be liked, does not cause a desire to revise it, but you admire it. Despite all the tragedy, all the pain that is contained in each frame, the film really admires. Although most of the reviews, both critics and viewers, are positive, there are fierce disputes about the film: someone does not like it decisively, someone sees in the film only the Joker, the villain opposing Batman. For me, this film is primarily about people, about the need to always treat everyone humanely. ""No one owes anyone anything,"" I don't dispute that phrase, but even without doing anything good to a person, you can be kind to them the second your lives cross.""The Joker"" is a one-man story, as frightening as it is realistic. Everything in this film is natural. By saying ""naturally"" I don't condone the cruelties that the3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"A dark twist of a movie made for Joaquin Phoenix, one of the greatest actors alive today","If ever there was a role made for a master actor, one who can wring out the lurking, soulful depths of depravity and insanity, with such intensity it is spellbinding, it is Joaquin Phoenix. From Commodus to Johnny Cash to the guy who falls in love with Her to the incredibly overlooked role he played in Master, the range of this best there is professional is beyond description. His every move, every sound, every painful looking move of the emaciated body he lost 55 plus pounds to play grinds with the grit and scum of the streets of crushing New York. His descent into insanity is a work of art. His laughter was so intense and so biting it will cause nightmares. Others have played tormented minds with great success. Violent, yes. So is the endless bottom of the pit shoveled over to the bottom of the heap of society, one of which he plays to perfection. It's a dark movie. Going insane is dark. And you will witness it line by line and be mesmerized by what you see Phoenix doing in every scene. There is hardly any room in this film for any of the other good actors.

Joker,Simply masterful.,"I'm seriously not a fan of the whole Marvel explosion of films that ,no matter how you view them , ends up being the same picture. This Warner Brother's film ,of the DC comic's top villain Joker, is nothing like any of those films. It's dark, depressing, bleak and extremely slow. Instead of letting the special fx's, fight scenes and testosterone filled action take center stage, it allows space for a mesmerizing acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Many are saying that he copied Deniro's performance in Taxi Driver, but I say that he honestly topped that performance by a mile. Deniro had no boundaries. Phoenix had to craft his performance within the boundaries of the comic book super villain named Joker, and he masterfully makes the transformation right in front of our eyes, within 120 minutes.The plot has been criticized for being heavy handed, but honestly the simple fact that we can have such a story still be relevant in 2019, shows that as a society we haven't been heavy handed enough. There are no happy endings in Joker. Some might say that it even glorifies or at least justifies the evils of the world. Maybe it does. But remember , the story ,like Phoenix's performance is bound by the DC story in the first place. If you have a problem with the bleakness , it might be because you are coming to the realization that at some point we will be Gotham because we are definitely following on the path of Gotham's past that this film represents.Overall, I don't know of a better Comic book film. As a matter of fact , it's the only comic book film of recent years that is Oscar worthy.",0

Joker,A beautiful dark and hard to watch MASTERPEICE üñ§,"I'm literally impressed and extremely happy
Joker will be the beginning of a revolution in the world of cinema and comic book movies ( i hope ).
This movie is brilliant, thrilling, sad and a beautiful dark masterpiece.
A spectacular character study with an unbelivebale and outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, this is by far the best performance in last
10 years, the way he laughs, his body language, his eyes, his facial expressions are all out of this world, Joaquin conveys all types of emotions in a sensational way.
The story is well paced and takes us step by step with arther and his fall from sanity to insanity each action and each detail matters and affects the coming events and makes us as audience understand to some degree the horrible actions that arther will do in the future.
This movie accuses us the society and puts the blame on us for the way we treat ourselves and how we create within us monsters.
The Joker that we get in the end is a moving representation of the corruption in our society and especially our media wich explains why there is a group of ""critcs"" that are demonizing
The movie and ignoring the art in it and the big message it carries.
Todd Philips you surprised me this is big jump in your career from comedy to such a perfected drama the shots, the close ups, the cinematography, the tone of the movie everything is really masterful and of course how can i forget Hildur guonadottir and her mesmerizing score that fits perfectly each scene and each transformations arther goes through, her soundtrack plays with our emotions and our nerves and makes us feel the darkness of this movie.
This Film is nearly perfect, hard to watch, tough and makes you think about a lot of things. The only thing that may be bugging for some is the heavy inspiration from Scorsese's movies especially taxi driver and the king of comedy, i don't consider this a bad thing each filmmaker must be ispired from other works but it's a little but obvious here even so it's not a problem for me and because of all the other good things that impressed me and touched my soul and the questions that this work of art made me ask i give it a 10/10.",0

Joaquin Phoenix played the role perfectly, and the character and story was beautifully created by Todd Phillips. Some of the dialogue wasn't very memorable, but then I realised that not every line has to be. After all, this film was meant to be what could possibly happen in a real scenario, and not everything said in real life is poetic or memorable.

Joker,Engaging from start to finish,"This film was engaging from the very first moment to the very last. That is not to say every moment was a blockbuster high action event, but the acting, pacing, and staging of every scene was so dynamic and carefully crafted that one feels engaged at all times, regardless of energy level. Joaquin Pheonix is truly a master of acting, and his ability to completely transform into Arthur is astounding. The piece that truly sells his role as Joker are his eyes: he truly has a madness in his eyes and they pierce through the screen. This film does not seem to fit into any one genre (horror, action/adventure, comedy) but rather is more like a character study and artistic demonstration on the formation of Joker in Gotham City. This is a modern, self-aware, psychologically relevant perspective on a traditionally outlandish, wild, and inexplicably wild villain from DC cannon. This sets a new standard for DC films, and puts the previous flops to even greater shame.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"normally when I come to the cinema to watch DC movies, DC usually let me down recently.","It is weird, normally when I come to the cinema to watch DC movies, DC usually let me down recently. But Joker 2019 is different. Bear in mind, Im no movie critic or something, Im just trying to justify my review as a fan who finally get the movie he want.
Normally, for a villain character, movie makers fail to justify his ""evilness"". Because they tend to isolate the character with the world around them, thus general movies create theme of ""edginess"" that me and others despite the most. But Joker is not a character, if somebody ask me to describe who, what, how is Joker, it is extremely difficult for me to explain who he Joker. Joker is more like a presentation of the society around him (Gotham City). There is no ""right right"" in this kind of scenario. Any characters in the movie are flawed in their own way. Many of them like Thomas Wayne of ""the rich"" are evil in many standard, but they convince themselves and the society around them that they are ""all good"". But Athur (Joker) fight back that kind of attitude, he tried to seek help but all the help he receive just pushed him further into madness. In the end, he is nobody, Arthur gave up his identity the society gave him to be reborn as Joker.
I have to say, watching Joker is very uneasy experience, it is very disturbing to be honest. So watch with ur own regard. But this is what art is, to push border, to go above and beyond normal standard. This film is definately special.",0
Joker,An epitome of Excellence,"To the people, who say Joaquin Phoneix deserves an Oscar for his performance, please pardon me, but I beg to differ. This guy does not deserve an Oscar, Oscar should beg in front of him and say ""Please accept me!"". He is a walking university of acting. Every scene, every private moment, every emotion, its beyond human perfection! This kind of cinema is a rare commodity.

Joker,"Not an action movie, but a psychological thriller.","I see a lot more great reviews for this now but when it first came I saw a lot of hate. I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick!",0
Joker,Truly a masterpiece!,"This movie isn't for all viewers who subscribe to mature audience material, especially viewers with acute depression and other mental disorders. Yet those who courageously go through the motions will find a high level of appreciation for the extreme psychologically graphic material delivered masterfully by an actor whose whole career is outshone by his performance in this movie alone.This being said, the iconic supervillain is finally seen coming to terms with his downhill path to unlock his true nature that defines the true nature of the Clown Prince of Crime, and the sordid story of his relationship to his mother.Much also provided with DeNiro's up top performance that greatly magnifies the intensity of one of the most shockingly memorable movie climax moment seen in years.Joaquin Phoenix outdid himself all around and outdid the hype masterfully.",0

One of 2019's biggest surprises, pushing the boundaries of what you're comfortable with looking at. Not once did it seem like I was watching a comic book movie. It's a chilling and artful approach to the iconic villain that doesn't hold back on exploring mental illness and the lower class in a brutally raw and honest way. Even with its occasional touches on the Batman mythos, which flowed well with the story and didn't seemed forced at all, the focus is entirely on Arthur Fleck's turmoil and transformation into the Joker and Joaquin Phoenix delivers a richly disturbing performance to support that. The psychological twists to some story cliches were unexpected and refreshing, too. Amazing film. Not for the faint of heart. I'll never listen to Frank Sinatra the same way again.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A brave new world.,"This is a landmark movie. Maybe one of the most important movies to be released in the last 10 years.
Not only is the film brilliantly made from how it looks and sounds, but it also has something to say it has balls.
I hope this film changes Hollywood perception on how not just comic book films are made but all films.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,All I have are positive reviews,"Just got back from seeing it 4 hours ago and it was as great as I thought it was gonna be, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic (everyone else is great too but Joaquin commands the entire thing), the score and soundtrack were fantastic, the opening credits fit perfectly with the theme, and even the cinematography is great (this was a grimier, dirtier, and uglier Gotham City than what we're used to). it can easily pass as a scorsese flick since his fingerprints were left after leaving the producer's chair. I'm torn between which joker I like best between ledger and Phoenix, but I know that heath ledger would be very proud of Joaquin for pulling it off, give him ALL the oscars I say, he's earned them. but anyway, I recommend this to scorsese fans and joker fans alike. I definitely wanna see it again, maybe even buy the blu-ray. on a side note, for it being a slow burn, it's actually a slow burn done right like The Godfather3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Fantastically produced art,"The uniqueness of this movie can't be underlined enough. As you can definitely relate it the likes of Taxi Driver, this film stands alone in its production, direction, photography, score etc. Albeit, it can be disturbing to some at times, it sheds light on very common issues in today's society including corruption, mental illness, etc. It took me days to conjure an opinion on this movie after seeing it, making it even more unique to myself.

The emotions I experienced in this movie, I don't think I have felt like this in a movie theater in a long time. The acting, direction, cinematography & music all deserve awards.

Joker,Beautiful and brilliant.,"Having watched Hollywood decline alongside with the latest trend of the dumbing down of nations (as I call this phase we are in), has made going to the cinema more of an empty distraction than a meaningful experience for the past number of years. Thus, when I sat down to watch this movie my expectations were low, as usual. It turned out that this movie was one of the best movies I have ever watched on screen.There is never going to be a Joker movie that can surpass this one - this was pure art scripted and performed by real talent. Joaquim Phoenix is also a real actor, unlike your usual dumb as hell, painfully overrated cadre of overpaid Hollywood pretty boys - who can't act.10.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Brilliant, Raw and intriguing take on The Joker.","The movie is dark, it's gritty and intense at times. Its a movie that gets the discussion going on so many questions that we ask within society today. Todd Phillips has done such a sublime job he not only handled the entire movie with care and attention to detail but he raised topics that are still being spoken and debated about today. Joaquin was perfection, DONT go into this thinking it's going to be the in the same realm as Heath Ledgers Joker it's so different. Almost like two different genres.Overall this is the best movie I've seen 2019, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. It's slower burner of a movie and the pay off is brilliant.10/10.This is a fantastic route for DC to follow.

Joker,Better than expected,"I had mixed feelings after watching the trailer. I said to myself that this won't be a good movie, no effects, no fast-paced action, no Batman, no classical Joker.Actually you don't need any of these in order to make a great movie. Joker is brutally realistic and atmospheric. It makes you feel thorned, in some moments you like and emphatise the main character, in others you hate him. We witness the development of a character and the birth of the Joker in a very realistic way. We miss such movies nowadays with good story telling, great atmosphere and almost to no CGI.

Joker,I created an account just to review this movie,"I went into this movie skeptical in terms of the hype around it. Now I understand it and I believe it deserves every part of it. The acting was, without exaggerating , the best I've ever seen from a male protagonist. As a literature enthusiast, the plot gave me the same feeling of watching a true literary classic unfold. Artistically, the construction of the scenes was immaculate, with the television reflecting the protagonist's psychological state and the recurring motifs of laughter and media used in the brightest of ways. The political commentary was not only well constructed but also incredibly relevant in our times.

Joker,"Dark, surreal and chillingly beautiful. Phoenix was truly brilliant","Absolutely brilliant! I loved it. Fleck's slow descent into insanity was beautifully tortuous. The brutality of society and the harsh realism of big corporations are the advocates and cause of his demise. The music throughout was atmospheric, haunting, and at times utterly surreal. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an oscar for his performance and portrayal. He clearly put so much effort into the role as can be seen from his characters physical appearance.

Joker,Dear DC make more movies like this. Please.,"Joker is what I call a masterpiece, the film was phenomenal, brilliant,etc. I saw the film x2 and i was the best film I have ever seen. People say Avengers Endgame, is the best films of this year..... ROTFLMFAO. Joker is the best movie of 2019. As for Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker, what can I say he deserves an Oscar for this performance, I can not stop praising how good he was, I felt every pain and laugh he went through, the film was just great. Ceaser Romero and Heath Ledger would be proud of this guy. Joaquin Phoenix is the guy who would put his acting skills first then the money. He was dedicated to play the Joker and he absolutely nailed it. Todd Phillips is now one of my favorite directors now, along with Matt Reeves, Steven Spielberg, and Chris Nolan. I saw two times and I plan to see it again. Because, movies like these deserve 2 billion dollars in the box office, NOT ENDGAME. 10/10.

This movie was written produced and played so well beyond words that can be spoken! The fact is this movie is just like society now people have no care or manners anymore. Everyone is so selfish and busy with themselves they only look out for themselves. People are given a bad hand and end up with issues that do need attention and help and our government spends more time on other things than actually helping our people in our nation!

Joker,A movie book experience,"This movie is like reading a book. Every scene has details of a psycopath's complicated emotions that are naturally perceived differently from one person to the other. This is exactly why it is a unique experience just like reading a book. This movie is not entertaining and it wasn't made to entertain people. I believe it was made for people to watch and think about it and live with it's emotions for a while. It is an unequal experience for different viewers. Those who see it as a marvel have understood why the movie was made in the first place and the messages drawn from it. Those not, have definitely missed the whole point. It is not a comic book movie for sure and the viewer needs to understand this before watching it.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Prodigious.,"I was pretty sure I was gonna like it but this film left me walking out the cinema speechless. The finest piece of work from Phoenix and Phillips.I have never rated or reviewed before, so this is my first one because I need to express my judgment for this movie simply because of the movie it ended up to be after anticipating since the start of production. This kind of acting and directing is exactly what I love and I consider to be my favourite being the huge film fanatic I am so I want to give all movies the right rating according to how I find them, so I would never usually give a movie a 10 because for me it has to be if not faultless but I am going to give this movie a 10 and to me here's why. I have always been a fan of Todd Phillips since his early goofy comedies to his later movies where I can tell he has set up a nice distinct directing technique and that is what I love about directors and the different styles they all have and use to put a film together, to then see what they bring to screen, but the way he has emphasised this film is truly remarkable. I didn't expect he would create and present a pure masterpiece but that is exactly what it is.
I have always loved Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker, it was extremely stupendous, One of the best acting roles we have ever seen in film history, you couldn't disagree. But what Joaquin Phoenix had innovated was so unique and astounding, it was exactly what I look for in playing a psychotic character. I was honestly blown away with his performance. I am going to be extremely disappointed and confused if these two men don't receive an Oscar for best writing/directing and an Oscar for best actor. I feel like I shouldn't even have to mention the fact that it was fairly especial and absolutely nothing like a film you would think is DC, to me it's not a superhero/villain comic book character movie. It is the best character study flick I have ever seen. I know it won't be for everyone considering the few scenes of strong voilence and language and could be disturbing to some so I understand peoples different opinions on how they find the film but I found it to be precisely a literal showpiece with extraordinary qualities.

Joker,Dark and profound.,"I purposefully didn't read other reviews, as I wanted my opinion of this film to be my own. Did I enjoy it, possibly not. It wasn't entertaining or entertainment. What it was √† dark, very dark and deeply disturbing reflection of our dysfunctional society. A society where the most vulnerable in society are marginalised and don't get the help or support they need.
This is a film about mental health and seeing it on Mental Health Awareness day provided a more powerful message than all the items on the news, in the press and on social media.
Joaquin Phoenix in the title role was beyond description in the way he bought this character to life. Chilling, frightening and yet at the same time conveying the vulnerability of a man lost in his own world, where there is no one to support him and no one who will listen to him and understand him.

Undoubtedly one of the 10 best movies of this century, and also , without a doubt , one of the 100 best movies ever made in the history of cinema. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible in his representation of the mentally ill Arthur Fleck, and as the Joker is, well, absolutely out of this world.

They complete each other.This isn't about the shrewd and brutal agent of chaos going about his business. This is about making of that epic character.A few things left open for interpretation (Thomas Wayne's note on the backside of an old photo being the biggest one) makes it even better.Phoenix has his name written on the Oscar.",0

Joker,Masterful Filmmaking!,"It's rare when we get to see a movie that's this close to perfect. Normally something or another, sometimes multiple things, are lacking in a movie. It could be one of the actors, the writing, the cinematography could be subpar, and on and on. To have a movie made like that this is so nearly flawless across the board is very special.Joaquin Phoenix plays, quite likely, his best performance to date which says a lot considering how many great roles he's already done in his life. When I first heard about this movie when it was in the works I'll admit that I thought Joaquin was miscast. Boy was I wrong and in retrospect I'm not sure why I thought that.Another thing that concerned me initially was that the director, Todd Phillips, was unproven as anything other than a comedy director (to me). Another major miss on my part there. Todd Phillips did an absolutely amazing job both directing and writing this masterpiece of a movie.Going back to what I said above, most movies suffer from scenes that are either wasteful, serving no purpose or scenes that are flawed. All of these scenes serve a purpose and succeed at it very well by adding to the movie in some way or elevating the movie in some way. Further, there were some scenes that if they weren't in the movie the movie as a whole would have been less cohesive. Todd Phillips did such an amazing job walking the fine line between having redundant scenes or scenes that barely told us enough to paint the picture of how The Joker became The Joker.Truly an amazing movie. I'd rate it between a 9.5 and a perfect 10.",0

Joker,Jack Nicholson's Joker is a (very) distant third.,"Let me start by saying, this is a DC universe I want to further explore.The movie does an excellent job connecting most of the main Gotham characters and the possibilities for a sequel or sequels are endless.
Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for best male lead. His performance of Arthur Fleck (i.e. Joker) is truly remarkable and with minimal dialogue, he conveys pain, disgust and an eventual decent to madness that will shock you. This is the most realistic Batman related movie.
The movie is a character and society study. On one hand, a character abused, beaten, humiliated and totally ignored and on the other hand, a society literary overrun by rats.
The story of the particular Joker is truly heartbreaking. From a boy full of happiness to the Joker. By the end of the movie, you are shocked but feel that you understand why Arthur Fleck became the Joker.
Don't pay attention to the ""woke"" media. Joker is an excellent movie and maybe one of the best comic book movies.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Art meets cinema,"An actor can elevate cinema, a mass entertainment medium to art which elevated the soul.The back story to how Joker became the Joker is moving, disturbing and entertaining at same time. The story moves along at its own pace and the moral justification for have nots may have its distractors but it is firmly in keeping with the Gotham universe. The descent of the Man into a place where nothing matters is convincing and the audience is moved.Violence shown is necessary and not gratuitous. It makes you flinch but still hooked on to the screen.This movie stays with you after you leave the hall.

As a modern day comic book film, you must admit WB has taken quite the gamble and it has paid off. A darker DC was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of ideas.

Joker,Time to start deconstructing superheroes,"Joaquin Phoenix is terrific and so is the film. Just like the era where westerns faded into dystopian anti-westerns, I hope we're going to start deconstructing superhero films. I agree with Martin Scorsese that superhero movies are closer to theme parks than actual cinema. He's nowhere near the first person to say it but he's right nonetheless. I hope we're entering an era in film where superheroes are deconstructed. That would be far more interesting than roller coasters.Regarding the film, I wouldn't have expected that a deep dive into the failings of our mental health system merging with grass-roots anti-fascist politics would be this compelling but here we are.I never really cared for Batman - he always seemed to be just a rich guy with expensive toys - so I guess I was open to the message but still, very very good movie (also very violent, don't take the kiddies).",0

Joker,Joker - A Criminal or Victim,"Best movie saw till date. Joker is that movie which takes you to BTS of villains that Hollywood has never shown.

Joker,A Masterpiece,"This film transcends its genre in a way I wasn't sure possible, and it is all credited to the understanding of the titular character by both the actor playing him, and the director directing him. I am an avid Joker fan. I read the comics, own many of the iconic graphic novels that center around him, and I can honestly say this is the character fully realized. I was honestly baffled by the level of character depth revealed, not just in the acting, but also in the direction. This movie is literally Arthur Fleck, aka Joker's, point of view; and the director and lead actor take you down the rabbit hole descent into madness in the best possible way. It's both incredibly original, and yet incredibly grounded and respectful of who the Joker is, and what we the fans have come to expect. The movie is not for everyone. It is not an action packed thrill ride. It's not an ultra violent theme park ride of sadism. It is a very realistic, psychologically in-depth character study thriller. It's slow burn tension, the tension being the character's descent into madness. I found myself on edge waiting for him to snap, and yet hoping that he would not. I did not expect that at all, and I can only praise the film more because of that. It creates depths I had not expected, nor had I imagined. Yet there they were! In short, Joker sits firmly next to The Dark Knight as a masterpiece of comic book filmmaking. They're the only two films that transcend the genre, and they both center around The Joker. Coincidence? I think not.",0

Joker,Don't compare Jokers,"Before its release, I too critically compared Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger (without having seen the movie!). But don't compare Jokers. This film is about Arthur Fleck. And as he transforms into the Joker, you will be dazzled by darkness. This is an awkward, creepy and uncomfortable cinematic experience. Ensure you're willing to explore madness, as you'll likely fall for one of the most enigmatic villains to hit our screens.

Joker,Flawless Masterpiece,"I made an account just to review this film. I have been hyped since the first trailer dropped (which I must have watched several dozen times, and several more in the run up to the release), and had the pleasure of seeing it last night.This was hands down one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have had the pleasure of being part of. There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already. The hype is honestly real and deserved.Everything from Joaquin Phoenix's performance to the music score, directing, and especially the writing, was flawless. This was such a beacon of hope in a time when big blockbuster CG films are all the rage. All that matters when you strip that away are characters. If you don't have great characters, no matter how pretty your film looks, it's not worth the time of day - and this film proves that. I hope more directors and writers learn a thing or two from this. And I don't mean to copy: I mean to write better characters and stories.I'll touch on the negative media reviews quickly by just saying: once in a blue moon, a masterful piece of art like this comes around, and of course the media try to create a moral panic around it. I won't deny that aspects and themes of the film are relevant to this day and age. After all, art is a reflection of the society it was created in. There's two levels to art: face value and what the piece itself represents at its core, and then its wider connections to the real world. It's up to us how we interpret it, and that's what art is supposed to do - to get people talking. This film has certainly done that, and it's a good thing. It's one of those films that will be studied and looked back on in a hundred years, for both its cinematic marvels as well as its relevance to today.tl;dr 9999999999999/10 would watch again",0
Joker,Excellent movie,"Everything about this movie was flawless, the music, cinematography, plot and acting.

Joker,A flawless and unique departure from comic book movies.,"Joker; the movie I never knew I needed. A cinematic breakthrough in the comic book movie genre, that despite being overly referred to as a masterpiece, is for sure a masterpiece. Todd Phillips directs Joker, the character study centred around Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix. A mentally ill man shunned by society, who finds himself on a rather dark path of discovery. This is undeniably the breath of fresh air the genre has needed since James Mangold's Logan.Without doubt the films greatest success, is it's ability to have you empathise and sympathise with an antagonist. Todd Phillips took one of the greatest 'villains' in comic history, and made him a relatable character. Utilising the character study format of story telling was key to accomplishing this success, as seeing the events of Arthur Fleck's life through his own eyes feels as engaging as ever. Remaining on the 'dark and gritty' side of comic book movies, the plot consists of many appropriate comments on todays society which add to not only the character of the joker but help shed light on a subject very present in our time. Make no mistake, this is a vastly disturbing film at times, the synergy between Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttin's gripping score and the imagery on screen is like a schizophrenic nightmare in the best way possible. I don't think I've ever endured such range of emotions throughout a film before. Joaquin Phoenix masterfully embodies the role of both Arthur Fleck and Joker, which is putting it lightly.Visuals and production design are a phenomenal display. Gotham City not only feels like an authentic city, but becomes a character in itself. The film is enriched with colour grading and light/shadows that accommodate what tone is being conveyed. This is a film that uses visual storytelling where it can and to it's best advantage, a unique aspect of Joker. The movie in general certainly feels inspired by some of Martin Scorsese's flicks, which only makes sense due to former arrangements for him to produce, if you're a fan of Scorsese you're sure to get a kick out of this film. As I mentioned beforehand this film is a breath of fresh air for the genre. This isn't your typical superhero punch em' up loaded with insane visual effects, action and world-devastating events. This is a charmingly stylised, grounded depiction of a comic book character who could theoretically exist. Again, Pheonix puts everything into this character and embodies his role. Todd Phillips' passion project met with Joaquin Phoenix's immaculate performance creates something really special that seems to have earned itself the title of an instant classic.Whether you're hunting a flawless movie or you're just tired of the loud theme parks comic book movies have become today and are looking for something truly unique, this one exceeds all expectations.",0

Joker,Masterpiece of how the joker was born,"I have to say that what we have here is a one off Masterpiece film directed by Todd Philips. First congrats to him and his team for putting out there one of the best realistic comic films of all time. This is where DC beat marvel because the DC villain Joker and Harvey Dent can actual happen in real life.So first to all comic fans, calm down and remember that this is a very different take on the Joker. this film does not follow any of the comic materials. This film has been made in a realistic way where it shows how society can push someone to their limits and we humans can effect people lives without even notice them.This films is a story about how someone can be pushed because of how society can treat and push someone and when someone has nothing to lose you will start to do things that you have never done. This guy was pushed so much that he started not to care and wanted to just feel good about himself. He started to find himself and his confidence is growing by the end of the film.You can't compare this joker version to any of there other joker version especially Heath's Joker because in the Dark Knight his version of the Joker has already established himself as the clown prince of crime where as Joaquin version of the Joker does not really know who he is, as the film goes on, he is trying to find himself and by the end of the film it looks like he has found himself that he looks set to explore who he is and I hope that if we can get two more films then each of the films will explore how he becomes the clown prince of crime and how he comes the most feared villain of Gotham city and Batman's most hated enemy.So remember when you hardcore comic fans watch this film, you need to remember that this is kinda of like an origins story of how someone in this case, this person becomes the joker who is becoming the someone who later will be known as the Joker or not. we have to many fan theories like this is this first joker and then we have three jokers but whatever, forget about all of the theories and go and enjoy this masterpiece. This film has a amazing soundtrack which strengthen all of the scenes which makes this film even more special. Also its not any other comic film like marvel who use too much CGI and most of their villains are not realistic which makes it sometimes not believe. I say that this film beats Marvel endgame and this has to be my favourite comic film of this year. I hope we get to see more two more films of this version of the Joker.This film does focus on people who suffer mental illness and it shows how we need to help more people in the world who suffer with mental illness and also treat everyone with full respect and help each other.So please to all fans, go and watch this film in the cinema as this is one of those films that you must watch in the cinema not at your home. This film was so emotional for me and it got me up my chair a few times. I will rate this film 5/5 stars and 10/10 rating.",0
Joker,Somehow able to exceed expectations,"Amidst all the hype and controversy, Joaquin Phoenix shines as bright as this film is dark. The score perfectly sets the mood and acts as an eerie backdrop to the film throughout. The plot is revealed from the story and doesn't rely on narration to carry the film. You can tell Joaquin Phoenix did his homework, his portrayal of a mentally ill man struggling to survive in a time of economic hardship is masterful. He is supported by a well selected cast, including the best depiction of Bruce Wayne seen on screen. They didn't reduce Dante Pereira-Olson's Bruce into a whining bratty child as many incarnations usually do. The movie mixes the plight of our down on his luck protagonist and provides an in depth look into the current sociologic climate, without weighing down the film. An excellent blend of comic accuracy and realism is used to create something comic fans and movie fans without knowledge of the character can both enjoy.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,The greatest piece of cinematography I have ever seen,"This film will go down in history. Simply amazing. The whole team behind this film should be commended, as well as proud of what they have produced. Throughout the years there are many films which simply come from Hollywood and satisfy viewers but are predictable with limited long lasting impact. This is not one of those films, you will walk out of Joker with your head in the stars, unable to Express what you have just seen. Joaquin delivers the best character portrayal I have ever seen, displaying the transition from Arthur Fleck to the Joker right the way through the film. I found myself smiling at his ability to deliver a perfect personality and mannerisms which we saw from Ledger, and although Heath gave us an amazing foundation when creating his Joker, I honestly believe Joaquin has made Heath proud. I don't believe I will see a film of this capacity for a very long time, and it is almost certain the film will win best actor and best director come the Oscar's in 2020.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Outstanding Movie; Very Realistic Story Line,"This movie opens up what goes into the mind of a troubled person. Scenes and circumstances is very relatable for the viewers and you can really feel how messed up Joker's life was prior to being Joker. In real life, these things happen behind the scene. While everyone thought everyone should be happy, there are times that life will not allow you to be. To be honest, the story line itself could trigger a lot of things. It could encourage people to stand up for themselves but the ""how"" of it will depend on the people. Truly, Joker set a high bar for other super hero movies. It showed the dark side of reality and the selfishness of humanity.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Deeply moving. Phoenix's performance is otherworldly,"The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular, the cinematography is beautiful, and the music is embedded in the film as I've never seen or heard before. The film indeed makes you feel unpleasant, scared and anxious, but why some people think that's a bad thing? It just demonstrates how good this movie is, immersing you in the story from begging to end. The fact that you sympathize with a mistreated person only makes you human, It has nothing to do with agreeing with violence. On the contrary, it makes you realize how we should be more compassionate, and care about other people.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Surreal experience....,"I don't write reviews too often for films I see however as much as I didn't expect much coming into this movie I left with a profound sense of awareness of society around us and just what may set off certain people in such a violent manner after years of taking abuse from others and often for no other reason than careless spite and taking pleasure in someone else's misery.
The movie is truly a social statement more than anything else that many may find odious or hard to swallow but one doesn't have to look far to see how the film speaks to a lot of truths we'd rather ignore and make excuses for.
As for Joaquin Phoenix I never had much of an opinion of his acting abilities but this movie has certainly heightened his standing in my view and rivals if not surpasses Heath Ledger's portrayal in 2008.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A Masterpiece.,"Many reviews here describe the movie as being: amazing, brilliant, a masterpiece and a work of art. None of those descriptions are wrong. The Joker is an extremely dark, powerful look into the mind of a man quickly descending into his own madness and inability to cope with the harsh, cruel world that surrounds him. In a cinematic world that's currently dominated by comic book movies laced with humour and CGI FX, it's ironic that a movie about The Joker provides none of that, but instead is the most serious and real of them all.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Absolutely BLOWN. AWAY.,"I never write reviews but this film has been ingrained in my head ever since I watched it that I was compelled to do so. It blew past my expectations, to say the least and my expectations were already sky high. Everything was so perfect! I'll try to keep it short as I break down what stood out for me.First, the film's score. It was so well made I cannot stress this enough. It fit every single scene and made them that much more powerful. It establishes a connection between you and the character. I felt what he was going through to the point where i was rooting for him.The cinematography was beautiful! Whether it was a close shot focusing on the joker or simply a wide shot showcasing the environment around him, it was astonishing.The acting was phenomenal and that is an understatement in my opinion. Joaquin immensely knocked it out of the park. He embodied the character so well. I truly believe this is one of the best if not the BEST adaptation of the joker.I will say 1 thing for those who are hesitant towards comic book movies, it did not feel like such. Even if you're not a fan of comic books, you can still enjoy it as much as anyone else. It has such a deep meaning which will leave you thinking for days. This film will truly, without a doubt, leave a huge mark in cinematic history.",0
Joker,So much better than I thought it was going to be!!,"I don't understand why people walked out of this film as it was a masterpiece!!
The violence was not over the top and very much in keeping with the Joker character, and what a performance by Phoenix it was! Never thought I would say this but it is on the same level as Heath Ledger's portrayal!! He must get the Oscar!!

Joker,Great standalone movie,"First of all, I'm not good with Comics and anything Marvel/DC related. I don't know any stories, or any facts whatsoever. I went to watch Joker as a standalone movie, like any other movie; and it was great.It is a slow paced movie. Methodical; you pretty much get to sympathize with Arthur Fleck; you get his pain and his delusions. Joaquin's performance is top notch!I liked this portrait of the Joker. A delusional maniac, hysterical, insane. When you see the Joker's' development into a satyrical killer, his descent into madness, it's fantastic.Overall, good movie! Not sure if it breaks any paradigm over what's in the books/comics, but, as a standalone movie, it is good.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

And today, where mental illness is relevant in our society, this is the perfect adaptation of the Joker in our time.You cannot compare Heath Ledger's joker with Joaquin Phoenix's. Both had incredible performances, but Phoenix's joker is different. This is not the criminal mastermind we are used to. This Joker is broken and shattered.Overall, this is the best movie of the year. I wouldn't be surprised of this movie got nominated, as well as Phoenix's performance",0

Joker,Outstanding.,"Joker delivers what it promises and more. A twisted tale of a sick man corrupted by a decadent society. It's clear the script was carefully written, and Phillips directed the hell out of it. Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's work also stands out, the music is as ominous and dark as the film itself. Finally Phoenix's performance as Arthur is something else, absolutely remarkable and Oscar-worthy. He carries the whole film on his shoulders with his performance, totally different from Ledger's but as riveting and astonishing.
Joker shows us more about the man behind the makeup, still it doesn't make anything entirely clear, forcing you doubt and rethink to everything you see.

Joker,Thank you Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix,"This is a masterpiece.
A bold statement but a true statement,
Ok this movie is getting a lot of hate And a lot of praise at the same time as it is like marmite you will either love it or not understand and fear and hate it, stating that it's promoting ill deads... it's not you need to understand it and remember it's most importantly art in the form of a film/movie.Always keep in mind it's a fictional story with fictional characters, which is difficult to do as the direction and acting are so good.
Now imagine your very darkest thought's and feeling the one's you never tell anyone,the one's that make you feel physically ill and the one's you would never act on because of your ethics your integrity and your morals,now take them time's them by 10 . That's the feeling you get from this extremely dark and thought provoking story of a man who has past the limit of sanity due to ill health and the toll of a negative outside world.
It's upsetting and moving to see such atrocities, the cruelty of man against his fellow man..
But this is true to Life,if you treat someone so badly you will break them,if life is so bad to you it will effect you, the portrayal of this side of man's inhumanity to Man is superbly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix he pulls you into the suffering in a way that you don't want to be pulled in.The violence that insues is an equal and opposite reaction to the original actions in Arthur fleck mind, a man that suffers from mental health issues and is then bullied, beaten and mentally abused by every one around him.
During the film you feel sorry for him you feel sickened by him and you feel hate for him, the sign of a truly good performance.
I don't want to Go into any further details as I'm not the type of person to spoil it for others.
The lighting the camera work and music are a perfect backdrop for this truly disturbing glips into a comic book villians backstory...a true testiment to a great director.
My leaving comments would be looking back at the real world and some of it's band wagon hopping on statements...
This is a movie,a piece of art, and an excellent movie it is.
If you as a person can't handle how dark and disturbing it is then that's okay just walk out, it's perfectly fine to do so
But please don't trash it cause it wasn't for you.
Its not promoting gun crime
It's not demoting mental health issues
It's not promoting violence.

Joker,Out of the darkness the joker is born,"First off I have to say this is one of my favourite films of the year.
Joaquin Phoenix plays a great portrayal as Arthur Fleck the man who in turn becomes the Joker, trying to fit into society and let down by society and Joaquin should win an Oscar for his performance in the film.Other reviews giving low scores saying it's not a joker film and not like Leto or Ledger. Each actor adds their stamp to a role as this isn't what Joaquin has done plus this movie is set before Arthur becomes the joker so it's all the back story leading up to the finale and the birth of the joker.People giving this film poor votes must not appreciate the film and yes it's a dark film but it portrays life and life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.I'd certainly go back to the cinema for a second viewing",0
Joker,THE Joker and more !!!,"Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe-in for Best Actor at next year's Oscars unless Daniel Day Lewis comes out of retirement and does something truly extraordinary. This film will bridge the gap between comic book geeks and serious cineastes because of his performance and the direction of Todd Philips. Never has Gotham looked so exhausted as it does here. No surprise that it is Joker's breeding ground. Helpless and hopeless, no wonder that he turns against the ""haves"".
The Joker has proved an iconic role. Just as we talk about Olivier's Henry V or Karloff's Monster or Chaney's Lenny, in the future we will be looking at Phoenix and saying ""yes,it's his defining role"". His speech, his body shape, his eyes - all come together to chill you to the bone. Yet there is poignancy there and inevitability and anarchy. The best film of 2019 with nothing to beat it unless Abrams pulls something out of the hat with ""The Rise of Skywalker"".3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Not a movie for everyone but a masterpiece nonetheless.,"Going into this film, I was unsure on what to think. I didn't wanna go in believing all the hype this movie had gotten but, I knew Joaquin Phoenix was one the best actors alive so I went into the movie with high expectations.Now, this movie might not be for everyone. It shifts in tone and pace a lot, there are political messages not everyone may get or enjoy. You mustn't go into this movie thinking it's your run-of-the-mill hero/villain flick', because it is anything but. This movie takes its viewers on a ride through many emotions present in the film. The script is beautifully written and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing in this rendition of the Joker character. He brings a different side of the Joker out for this film. Something I dont believe any of the former actors to have portrayed the Joker brought which is a sense of vulnerability. A sense of pain and sadness.I recommend you see the movie for yourself. It may not be a movie everyone will enjoy, but I believe it was perfectly executed and a downright masterpiece.",0
Joker,A stunning artistic achievement - DC at its peak,"JOKER (2019) directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Pheonix in the role of a lifetime as the titular character, is a film that explores the complexity, stigma and volatility of severe mental illness. Set in the fictional DC metropolis, Gotham City, Joker paints a nasty portrait of a damaged city, struggling with rising crime, disillusionment and 'super rats'.Arthur Fleck is barely existing as a clown for hire, living with his elderly mother in their tiny apartment; their only relief from the tragedy of their lives is watching America's favourite late-night host, Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) on their old television. Arthur has delusions of grandeur, imagining himself as a successful stand-up comedian, which is ironic based on his 'condition' that elicits unprovoked and uncontrollable laughter in stressful situations. A journal contains all his dark thoughts and is littered with disturbing images and expressions of suicidal ideation.The film depicts Arthur's descent into psychopathy, through revelations and events that call into the question the reality he was brought up with. The film may be deeply disturbing for some, particularly the scenes of graphic violence, that play out with the same level of overt intensity and clarity as the rest of the film - nothing is held back. In fact, the audience is left in a confusing state between horror and humour, since many of these disturbing scenes include brilliant moments of levity.That's right, it's not all psychological horror, there are moments of humour that is the result of Pheonix's mannerisms and his diabolical laugh. It's a physical performance, while director Todd Phillips maintains a consistently gloomy colour palette that is broken only by the clown paint and the clown masks that show up at various points in the film.Speaking of Pheonix, he is incredible, fully inhabiting this character and creating a genuine debate as to which Joker performance was better: him or Heath Ledger. Although such a discussion is unnecessary since they are both transcendent in their own way.JOKER is a truly incredible artistic statement that will be remembered, revered and talked about as much as the last great DC film, The Dark Knight (2008). While I am hesitant to pump out a review immediately after seeing it once, there is no doubt I will watch it again and again and wait impatiently for the next one.Highly, highly recommended

Joker,Best origin story in the DCEU,"I don't understand what movie the ""real"" critics watched. Reviews like the ones I've read online for blogs, newspapers and other news sites continue to make me lose faith in the supposed movie critics. After seeing their reviews and then going to see this movie, I am pretty much convinced that majority of them are just a bunch of hacks and their reviews are written prior to them actually seeing a movie. I can only hope that this Joker movie isn't just the origin for the Joker, but the origin story for the next Batman. Well done Joaquin Phoenix.What happens if you had just the absolute worst day of your life? Or worst week? That's what happens to the Joker in the comics. And this portrayal of this unfortunate man who, coupled with a city facing civil unrest and growing resentment of upper classes and disdain for lower ones ends with something that could actually happen. Is it right? Is the character one to be empathized? No. He makes bad decisions. He does terrible things. But that is the JOKER. Go for the story, go for the drama. Not for action. And not if you're one of these holier than though critics that write negative reviews just to bolster their own credibility but lack an attention span to actually watch an entire movie.",0

Joker,A masterpiece.,"This movie is a masterpiece. I just saw it in the theater today and I will go see it again. This is an amazing origin story for Joker and his minions. It is also a commentary about how far left ideology (Antifa), the media terrorizing people with exaggeration and lies, cities run by corrupt people until they are filled with trash, rats, sickness, and homeless, and turning our back on the mentally ill can lead some people to total desperation and violence. It doesn't endorse violence, but I do think it explains how some people end up there. It should be a warning. Don't let negative news take your hope and make you apathetic. Choose kindness. Don't wait for corrupt leaders to fix cities they have let go to ruin - make the city better yourself (like Scott Presler)! After doing what you can for your community, make sure to expose the people who are corrupt and taking in millions, or billions of dollars and somehow never fixing the problems in the cities that they run. Last but not least, we do need to have a better support system for the severely mentally ill, and not the waste of money NY city is doing right now. We need to help the millions of severely mentally ill people currently on the streets, not just have ""feel good"" programs that may prevent more.God Bless America.",0

Joker,Joaquin Phoenix for the win!,"I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize..... it's a comedyWOW. Now that's what I call an agent of chaos. Best actor goes to Joaquin Phoenix for his incredible intense mind blowing performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker. This is the origin story to beat all origin stories. I was thoroughly entranced for 2 hours watching his painful transition from a beaten down sad sack to the famous insane maniacal narcissist we all know & love. I will have to see this on the big screen again soon, it was a brilliantly laid out psychological character study that gave me a lot to think about when it comes to the DC world of the caped crusader's nemesis I've always known. This story has a major shift to how I've perceived the crazed, hapless, clownfaced criminal, since I first saw him portrayed by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, & of course, fairly different than the outstanding portrayal by Heath in TDK. Arthur just keeps having one bad day after another, so I felt sorry for him in this story as I never had before.The score by Icelandic composer Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir that was heavily powered by her dramatic cello was a perfect match to show how this story unfolds, & the classic Sinatra songs, ""Send in the Clowns"" & ""That's Life"" along with ""Jimmy Durante's ""Smile"" were a natural choice for the soundtrack as well as several old rock songs like Cream's ""White Room"", The Guess Who's ""Laughing"", The Doors ""People Are Strange"", Pink Floyd's ""Brain Damage"", & The Bee Gees ""I Started A Joke"" (just to name a few) went so well with the character development.If you're expecting a comic book super villain story similar to the previous versions of Joker on the big screen, you might be disappointed. However, go see this with an open mind & watch the goddamn genius that is Joaquin play Joker as he's never been played before & maybe you'll love it like I did.",0
Joker,Haunting and wonderful.,"This is not an easy watch, but it sure as Hell is a rewarding one.Phoenix hits it out of the park as Arthur Fletch and his descent into madness is a display like no other. The supporting cast are superb, the soundtrack is phenomenal, I really can't find a bad word to say about this film. It's a masterpiece.It's a slow burn, but that works really well for the tale the movie tells. When it does ramp up, it really ramps up, with the final act being a terrifying thrill ride.The feeling I got watching this film was reminiscent of watching Breaking Bad through for the first time. It was uncomfortable, but extraordinary, and I couldn't look away from start to finish.10/10, outstanding.",0

Joker,One of the best films I've ever seen,"This was honestly one of the best films I've ever seen. I have NEVER wrote a review about a movie before, but I absolutely had to for this. The acting was impeccable. To turn a bad guy into such a well liked character is such a hard thing to do. The twists and turns had me gasping in my seat.

Joker,Absolutely BREATHTAKING movie and role play by Joaquin Phoenix,"First of all, let me say that I cannot emphasize enough how mind blowing this movie is. I don't know how I am supposed to enjoy a movie after this, it just won't be as good.
But let's get into it. It has been a long time since I hadn't watched a DC movie in which the scenario and the role play took over the actions and the commercial frills. This movie is realistic. It reflects the reality of a society that we might live in someday in the near future. I was also iBut the real asset of this masterpiece is Joaquin Phoenix. I don't want to fall into unfair comparisons with Heath Ledger, for the latter has had the chance to have a whole movie centered on his character. However, I just cannot imagine a more genuine, breathtaking performance as Joaquin's. I was in total admiration on each of his scenes and Joker laughs. He nailed them all. Also, the evolution of his character all along makes each segment of the movie more intense and more mind blowing than the previous.
If you're not a comic fan, this movie can easily lead you to it. It gives you chills. It's an absolute masterpiece that's not ready to be topped.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,DC's Dark Game Changer,"This film was everything I wanted it to be and more. DC should stop trying to do what Marvel has and capitalise on this realistic R-rated style and tone for their films. Not many people could pull off a convincing Joker for an entire film, and neither did Phoenix. This film is about Arthur's transformation, he doesn't fully become Joker until the very end of the film.
This is the story of a man's descent into madness done in the most realistic way possible, taking little inspiration from source material and focusing on what makes the character at his core so polarising.
Aside from the incredible acting, the cinematography, score and pacing of the film married perfectly with Phoenix's take. No screen time was wasted, everything that happened had a purpose or a meaning.
The inclusion of the Waynes in the story was a surprise but a welcome one.
Laying the groundwork for the upcoming Matt Reeves Batman film potentially.
I truly do hope we get to see Phoenix do Joker properly in a future film, but for now I hope this is the catalyst to start the DC Dark series with more films in this realistic R-rated style and tone made for adults and not kids.",0

Joker,IM DA JOKA BABY!,"From all of the kinos Joaquin Phoenix has been apart of, he can still give performances that secedes and compliments each role by unlocking the human experience. You're not supposed to feel empathy towards an autistic psychopath (incel), but Phoenix's adaptation of The Joker gives a nuanced perspective towards the cliched archetype. Critics who fear that this film will incite violence and inspiration towards the incel community are right.

Joker,Best comic book film of all time.,"Not only is the Joker the best comic book adaptation on film I have ever seen, it is by far the best film of 2019 I've seen. The moments that gave me chills were the scene when Arthur is holding little Bruce's face and then when he is in the stairwell with his mother's medical chart and verifies everything Tom Wayne told me was true about his mother. Learning everything he thought he knew was a lie and the anger that grew within him that bought him to such disillusionment with his world it made him kill the one person he most loved in his world and turn him into the psychopathic killer. Her death killed Arthur Fleck and reincarnated him into the Joker. The twist with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz ) was brilliant and totally unexpected.Wow. This film was like a Greek Tragedy play. This is the film I wish all other comic book movies were modeled after. Nothing is over the top, everything is plausible in this realistic world. No super powers or grandiose schemes. Arthur Fleck is just a regular man like the Waynes, but without the fortunes of the Waynes. Just a man who beleaguered with abuse, lies, manipulation and misfortune that snaps into the killer he becomes.I did not want the movie to end because I loved it so much. My bladder was at the point of bursting but I did not want to leave my seat and miss a thing. This is a titanium scribed A++. It is rare I think of any movie as a perfect 10 out of 10, but this movie hit that score. I was left thinking about this film hours after I left the theater. DC Black finally blew away everything Marvel had out of the water with this film. All thanks to a super talented film director and one of the best actors of our era Joaquin Phoenix. If the Oscars don't see it fit to grant him an award, then the Oscars have no redeeming value.",0
Joker,Absolute masterpiece.,"Well, where do I start. This movie is phenomenal and if Phoenix does not get an Oscar, I really do not know who should. I have seen numerous way worse Oscar winners and performance of this man was not only very good or convincing - it was hypnotic.However, I have a one huge advice for everyone willing to see this movie - DO NOT watch is as a superhero movie (do not try to compare him to previous Jokers, do not try to follow the lore, etc.). You will be disappointed. It is an utterly different genre and experience.Watch it from the point of view that every single one of us may be in Joker's place. We just need one bad (good) day. And only then this movie will reveal its brightest colors.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,ART,"An extraordinary movie, the message is strong and we must all be kind to all people and respect them! An accumulation of extreme situations, which I can say may even be realistic and quite possible at that period of time, because there was not as much information as there is today, although there is a lot of bullying these days and can sometimes be an unfortunate cause of some dramatic situations that happen, but as a fictional movie (that's what it is), I think overall the movie is almost perfect! I don't know if will be considered for Best Picture due to the hypocrisy that exists in the United States, but Phoenix deserves to win any awards that appear, it is the best role of his career! From the beginning to the end of the movie it's a brutal character transformation and he drove it to the limit to embody a Fiction character who was always been an psychopath and let's say he already deserves it for a long time! And a casting that fits the story very well, although they rarely appear, are crucial to the development of this character. I'm sorry it's just this movie made by Todd Phillips and Phoenix ... But I have a little hope that Phoenix will be able to reconsider returning to the role in Matt Reeves's batman movie, as a older joker, if not I think Dc (Dc Black) could advance with more mature movies like this one! 9.5",0
Joker,Pure cinematic bliss,"Now THIS is a comic book movie worthy of oscar attention. There's a lot going on here. We see the inside of a troubled man as he goes through the transformation of turning into DC's finest villain. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix have created an emotional, brutal and almost painful film to watch (in a good way). The film follows Arthur Fleck's character throughout the entire run-time and the audience is pulled into this sad man's life as everything just seems to be tumbling around him. The way people treat him and the way his behavior unintentionally makes others uncomfortable is tough to watch but it is a brutal reminder of the hardships faced by people like him. Watching him turn into this downward spiral into the villainous Joker is entertaining, rewarding and disturbing. The film is about the evolution of this broken down man trying to find a place in society and then taking another path instead. This is a tragic tale done excellently. The cinematography and score is stunning, the directing is extremely good as well. The use of songs in the film are very well done. Every character really sells their role in the film, from the bullies, to the ones that try to help, to the extras in the talk show. Everyone brings their A-game into this film and nothing feels out of place. Joker is destined to be a cult classic and it's a hopeful change in direction for comic based films. This is a movie that will be remembered for a long time.",0

Joker,"Brilliance That'll Send Chills, and clowns","One of the most anticipated films of the year, and one of the most unwanted, at first. Following Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto, and (the best) Health Ledger, was not easy but they got another renowned actor, Joaquin Phoenix, to play his take on the notorious villain. On top of the actor, the direction was up in the air and the choice of giving the reins over to Hangover director Todd Phillips was more worrisome. However, knowing Phoenix takes choosing his roles very seriously-only picking up the good ones-made having confidence in Phillips easier. Having a director suddenly switch genres and go in a totally different direction has been seen before and with Phillips, we get the surprise, and laugh, that we wanted.
Joker delivers exactly what you'd expect and want and then gives you more than you ever could have imagined. This film pushes the boundaries, it gives the gritty realism of the world's cruel moments their spotlight. It may receive backlash for it's brutally honest portrayals, it has already even before it was released. Though, it will definitely leave you thinking about it's many messages as you sit and watch the credits roll with Sinatra's perfectly themed song.
The controversies are created by the stirring up of the thoughts in the audiences' minds after witnessing Arthur Fleck's character development. This buzz does good in making this film more popular but more importantly gets the public to think more about the lessons to be learned about how to treat others. Sure, the main takeaways can easily be focused on the violence depicted and how striking it is, but it's the journey leading up to the acts that should be pondered on more. It's this very character arc that makes this movie so powerful and moving. It's brutal but it's real, that's what hits home the most.
Phoenix's performance is lived-up to and yes, Oscar-worthy. He clearly has taken preparation for the role seriously since he's lost over 50 pounds and nailed the sinister, contagious laugh, making his own twist on it by making it a condition of an uncontrollable laughter that Fleck has. You are glued to every scene he is in, waiting to see what unpredictable thing he'll do next, which is exactly who the Joker is at his core. Chaos.
There's also beautiful cinematography that complements with the subtle, yet terrifying, score. The clear and present Scorsese influence and nods-to are seen and invited, Robert freakin' De Niro is in this, come on people. Phillips also really brings us into this grimy urban 80's setting of Gotham perfectly. The cold harsh streets littered with trash and the poverty-stricken rundown housing.
Since there has been so much worrisome talk about this film, before it even was released to the world, you have to get the hint that it is not one to miss. However, when you do see it, go in as open-minded as possible or just go with premeditated ideas, the Joker is sure to rattle you anyways by the end of it. Either way, the messages and thought-provoking questions that this film instills into the audience is what truly sets this film apart. It's a masterful work of original filmmaking and we get to witness it, so please, sit back and just smile.

Joker,Visceral tension throughout,"A jaw dropping masterpiece of filmmaking. I kept waiting for it to get violent as the media hyped this to be something that would trigger would-be psychopaths. And though it had a few intense scenes, what made Joker a film that put me on the edge of my seat and caused me to forget to breathe was those moments when Arthur Fleck was so alone with his thoughts and fantasies; that he allowed himself to dive headlong into, making the audience question of what they were seeing was really happening to the character. I often found myself empathizing with the pain Phoenix placed inside of the character. And I could almost never anticipate what he was going to do next.

Joaquin Phoenix is a god and this is right up there with his best work in The Master, You Were Never Really Here, Her, Two Lovers, Inherent Vice and more. Todd Phillips deserves so much praise for bringing this beautifully twisted portrait to life. Everything from the cinematography to the score to screenplay was just perfect.

Joker,What makes the perfect villain?,"Heath Ledger showed us that a truly terrifying antagonist can't be reasoned with. Joaquin Phoenix now shows us how anyone can even reach such a point. Joker is a character study of the clinically insane and wildly unfortunate comedian/clown looking for a break in Gotham.The film's primary strength is the first-rate performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it is further bolstered by a number of interesting creative choices and sound fundamentals. Sound is putting it modestly. The prodigious score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir marches the plot forward as cinematographer Lawrence Sher always seems to find the perfect shot. This all comes together into a fantastic whirlwind of surprise and jaw-dropping disbelief as director Todd Phillips plays with audience and character perception like puppets on a string.Joker is relentless in its character building and storytelling. It is without a doubt, film of the year.",0
Joker,Brutal piece of art!,"Man, it blew my mind!As a Joker fan, I was eager to see Joaquim Phoenix's portrait of the Mad Clown. I was really excited, but the flick was beyond my expectations.It made me CRINGE, it made me CARE for the character. I felt for him many times, even knowing that the evil was there, lurking inside. It's a descent into madness, and it also makes us think about our place in a society. Are we paying enough attention? Are we caring enough for people who really need us?The Joker is a villain, of course, but he's also a victim. Or better: he's first the victim and THEN the (wicked) villain.The scene when he's ""turned"" into the psychotic and dangerous clown we all love to fear, is EPIC. The soundtrack, the score... DAMN, that was amazing!Phoenix delivers an IMPRESSIVE work and deserves all the recognition! What an actor, my friends, what an actor...",0
Joker,Must see!,It's a work of art. Everything from the music choices to the acting to cinematography and story progression is absolutely astounding.

Joker,"Hard to watch, hard to look away.","By the time the roll credits started to show up, I was still not prepared to properly rate this movie. I would say it's one of the most overwhelming experience I've had in the cinema. After letting it simmer for a while, I'm definitely confident to say that it's one of the best movies this year thus far.The story of ""Joker"" shows us the downward spiral of Arthur Fleck, a down-on-his-luck comedian and a mentally unstable man with a disorder that prompts him to laugh uncontrollably at any situation that causes stress.That's enough of a plot description, because what you are about to see is a harrowing journey that at some point will make you so uncomfortable you almost can't bear it. Not saying that it went too far, violence-wise, but it's almost too depressing to be entertaining.Joaquin Phoenix embodies the character so well and convincing that you can't help but be in awe of what he has achieved here. It's almost a one-man show, to be honest. The side characters are sidelined (pun intended) just so we could witness his transformation from this meek, nice guy to the titular Joker. Still, Robert DeNiro as the talk show host also served as a highlight.I'd also say that I was never bored throughout the 2-hour runtime, given the grim and oppressive nature of the story. The slow-burn pacing is top notch and contrasted with some gruesome violence. Yes, it has visual cues from Scorcese classics (the aforementioned ""Taxi Driver"" is one of them) but there's nothing to distract me as unoriginal or something of a copy and paste. Some developments are really surprising and managed to bring some intrigue that will bring viewers to question what's really true or not, most importantly how it ties with a particular character (you could guess who it is).I gotta say that this has the best third act any movie could offer. My jaw dropped right at the climax for how audacious and sharp the way things were handled in it. There are powerful messages on how society works and how we should treat people with mental illness, especially to people like Arthur in this day and age that will resonate with me long after I watched it.Overall, I do think it has a staying power to be an essential movie or a classic outside the comic-book genre. Despite the controversy and the polarizing reviews, I'd recommend seeing it for how it pushes the boundary in commercial and mainstream filmmaking.",0
Joker,Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?,"I went back from the movie yesterday. Phoenix definitely deserve an Oscar for this performance.Don't believe the critics, this film was one of the best films I had watched in my life. The critics dislike the film due to political correctness and moral highground. Come on we all know what is happening in the world right now.Yes, the film was definitely disturbing, dark and violence but point to the core problems of our societies. The emptiness of our cultures, the ever widening income gap and the hypocritical of human nature will still be there with or without this movie. At least the director has the guts to point out the problems and let us have the chance to rethink and rebuild our world before it is too late.We don't listen, do we?",0

Joker,MASTERPIECE!,"It's dark, bold, and harsh portrayal of the mentally ill person who got beaten down by the apathetic society to the point where he left feeling having no choice than to ""fight back"" in a brutal, deranged way as his mind is.
The movie makes you feel emphatic for the character, but not justify the things he did or labeled it as good things. it's showing us what ignorance, lack of decency, and a broken system can cause in the most extreme way possible.

Joker,Thank you todd phillips.,"Its very hard to analyze whats going on in this movie, or maybe my head is flooding with words i cant write, since i was a kid i have always been a fan of dc and joker
Seeing him in batman the animated series(1992) or tim burtons take on the character or even reading comics that involved him made me realize not only how complex this particular character is but also how he can be written in so many different ways.
Today im 22 years old, i walked into the theatre thinking that the hype might be coming from fans missing the joker on screen, but hold on a minute, todd wrote and joaquin delivered!.
Legendary performance, great writing, moving score, great use of color pallets and a mesmerizing study/deep look on both the joker and society, thats not all, expressing to you how the joker made me feel throughout the movie is a hard thing to do, so i leave the rest to you.

Joker,MASTERPIECE,"#FinalVerdictJoker movie is a thunderous masterpiece! Can easily compete with the best comic book films of all time. The best movie of 2019 which belongs more in the Joaquin Phoenix Universe than the DC Universe.In the media, director Todd Phillips's Joker movie has been frenetically celebrated and a possible Oscars 2020 blessing (otherwise unthinkable for a comic-based film) is speculated violently. Let me say it loud and clear: there is not a word of it exaggerated.Joker movie is an ""origin story"", which tells how poor Arthur, nicknamed Happy by his mother, will become one of the most famous enemies of Batman. However, here there is no question of the Dark Knight, the story unfolds when Bruce Wayne is still a child.Surprisingly, Joker movie is totally a drama. A hard drama, rough, bitter, in a sticky environment. An environment that does not help Arthur to adapt. Director/writer Todd Phillips & cowriter Scott Silver take time to present the characters, places and situations.Joker movie is a work closer to auteur cinema. It's important to note that there's nothing wrong with this movie. Director Todd Phillips manages to infuse a very stylized colorful theme with the dark at the same time. It's bold, devastating & utterly beautiful.The sombre staging tackles you from the first second, shaking you through for two hours and never letting go until the last second. Joker movie is a horror story, not the celebratory tale of an antihero. Joker is a game changer and plays in a league of his own.The great soundtrack consists mainly of classics of the swing era (Frank Sinatra et al) and is an integral part of the plot. The congenial score of Hildur Gudnadottir amplifies the power of the images many times, so that every scene penetrates deep into the bone marrow.Director Todd Phillips is a revelation at the helm and does the best directing job of his career with the twisted material, able to strike a tone that straddles stabs of bleak darkness, gasps of hope and pangs of inevitability. I doff my hat to you sir!DOP Lawrence Sher's no-frills work to emphasize twisted, dark cityscapes, streets & nightmarish forms deserves a huge shout-out. With picture-perfect contrasts & color, sublime compositions, the rich and complex mise-en-sc√®ne succeeds in elevating the movie.But all of this impressive, stylish construction wouldn't have worked without Joaquin Phoenix. He inhabits his role with a commitment that's magnetic in its unpredictability. His unbelievable performance will leave the most lasting impression on the audience. Robert De Niro - one of his best roles for a long time! Zazie Beetz is remarkable.I left the cinema with lasting impressions & my mouth open. Beneath this gripping, bold, revisionist psychological thriller, Joker is the comic book villain we deserve right now.Joker movie is a masterpiece! Its understanding doesn't cross the line into sympathy, as we're left watching a man who becomes less & less human as his tragedy unfolds. We repeatedly see him burst into laughter, but can never rule out whether he's actually crying.",0

Joker,Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history,"People criticising this film for being 'dark and disturbing' is purely hypocritical, in my opinion. When you're making a film about the world's most twisted mind, the end result is bound to be dark and disturbing. If not, then the movie clearly hasn't captured what it means to be turned into the Joker. It doesn't matter whether this film has derived inspiration from a few previous films or any other source for that matter; by itself, this film is unique, classy and a sheer masterpiece.7 out of 17 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Literally the best piece of art made in the 21st century,"This movie perfectly encapsulates every feeling I have experienced in my entire life and made it all worth it. This picture is white people's ""Black Panther"", and men's ""The Notebook"". If you don't fall into both of these categories you probably will not understand the beautiful essence of this movie. This is not merely a movie, it's a message, it's a mirror to society and its a masterpiece. It is unfair to only give this a 10/10 rating because it should not be limited to a numerical confinement. Anyone who does not love this movie has not understood it. What we see in this movie is a cruel assault on Arthur by everyone around him. Society chews him up, completely ignoring what makes him different, and he is left with no choice but to force people to acknowledge his illness. If you think this movie might not be for you then you're right.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,It's About a Man,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,It's not about Joker and Gotham but about You and your City,"I USED TO THINK MY WHOLE LIFE IS A TRAGEDY BUT NOW I THINK IT IS A COMEDY....The Film which every person can relate to , JOKER is a must watch for all masses. Directed and co-written by Todd Philips , the film deals with the journey of one of the most infamous villains of the DC Universe. The Journey of Arthur Flek to JOKER and the reasons behind him to become Joker.
CAST :
Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Flek was really a great choice as he perfectly fits into the character. His commandable harwork and mental preperations to get approach to the character would make you fall in love with the actor and the character as well. This was his film. As viewers we never felt that Arthur did anything suddenly. His mannerisms and acts slowly developed through his experiences. Joaquin's nervous laughter referencing it to a psychological condition (Pseudobulbular effect) , his uncontrollable run which portrays his loneliness in the society
Robert De Niro as a late night talk show host, Murray Franklin was brilliant in his performances. It was so refreshing to see sucha legendary actor actually putting a work in a commercially driven film. Although his role was small but it was effective.
STORY:
The film showcases the origin story of one of the infamous villains of the DC Universe. The first look of the film made it clear that it is going to be a masterpiece. Based on the late 1970s in Gotham City when there is extreme social and civil unrest due to high unemployment. The film has been shown through the eyes of Arthur Fleck- working as a clown in Gotham City. The film takes us on a absolute journey of him losing his control over himself , his loneliness , lack of guidance and companionship turns him into the manic state of Joker. AND ONE THING ABOUT THE MASSES WHO HAS NO IDEA ABOUT DC UNIVERSE. This film doesn't glorify the acts of Joker , neither does it has any relation with the Batman series. It simply showcases the USA in 1970s and how the common masses felt oppressed and angry towards the prieveged. How people gravitates anyone who takes a stand. Absolute anarchy can lead a man to do many things and Joker portrays one of them. The fim ends on a note leaving a fine connection between child Bruce and Joker which might even lead to a sequel of the DC series
Reasons why you should watch the film
1. Todd Phillips Direction - It was really praise worthy for the director of Hangover to pull off such a humanistic approach of the Joker.
2. Joaquin's Phoenix acting, as previously said - the man's hardwork can surely bag him an Oscar. His hard work such as loosing his physical and mental health just to fit into the character. His absolute loneliness , sadness and madness have been excellently portrayed by the man.
3. Location and music. The background music was so apt that the masses could easily co-relate Athur's journey of sadness and madness
4. Dialogues. The story has been designed beautifully with the dialogues. The film has few of the greatest quotes that has not been used in films for decades.
5. Character development. I think this film is one of the very few films is DCU where a character has been built properly. It clearly portrays that a villain isn't always a superhero. It is an ordinary man who has been made villain by the oppression and loneliness of the society",0

Joker,Amazing! Saw this 3 times,"Believe the 10 stars. It's that good. I really did go and see it 3 times (wouldn't it be great to have to upload your tickets to comment haha). So anyway, it's that good it proves that if something is that good you will spill money into it.The writing and performance is spectacular. The colours, camera work (so much beautiful art and passion went into this and you can tell). Joaquin puts in such an amazing performance that it doesn't feel like a performance, it feels like someone passionately believing in what He is starring in and not just here for the paycheck.The director, god bless you. You are a God among men, as the recent dross of the last decade you have reset the clock in movies and vindicated us the fans that Hollyweird is capable (when they stay hands off) of great art. So God bless you Todd Philips for fighting the industry for 2 years to bring this to screen and give us something so heartfelt.Everything about this movie is so spot on I really hope (if you havent) give it a chance. The 1 star shills should be ashamed. As should the Lame Stream MSM who were so wrong. I payed, yes PAYED to see this beautifull work of art 3 times, have bought the wonderfull vinyl soundtrack on (limited to 750 purple vinyl) & am awaiting the release of 4k steel book blu ray so I can watch this many more times.Hollywood take notice. People will invest money into things they LOVE.",0

Joker,What a relevant end to an absolutley horrifying decade (2010's).,"I rarely go to movies anymore because I think modern movies are hollow and nothing but reboots, sequels that are done to death, etc, but after I saw how much hate the ppl#x27;s and people were giving it and how it was apparently going to trigger an ""incel rebellion"" I just needed to check it out. The media HATED this movie and wanted it to fail, which is why this is one of the best movies in a long time. You know somethings amazing when the right people hate it.Arthur Fleck is a man who is disabled, bullied, and constantly shat on by society. Out of a job and taking care of his mother things take a turn for the worse. After seeing how crazy America is getting with wealth inequality, the militarization of police, super-rats, he has taken the black pill and realizes that nothing else matters in such a cruel and insane society. Arthur has had enough and becomes a celebrity that modern America deserves.This movie and it's themes of mental illness and childhood abuse reminded me a lot of Natural Born Killers which was released 25 years ago in 1994. In that movie, Bonny and Clyde characters Mickey & Mallory Knox have both been abused by their parents as well as having mental issues, decide to go on killing spree that makes headlines.I wasn't expecting this movie to have a lot of action but it didn't need it. Every minute is just as grungy, morose, and depressing as the one that comes after it. The atmosphere is so incredibly dark and hopeless which meshes perfectly with the gritty subject matter. This is in total contrast to 2008's Joker which was packed with action and was more of a good vs evil tale.The dialog is amazing. The acting is amazing. The music is amazing. Everything about this movie is top-tier.I never even knew Todd Phillips directed it until I saw his name on it and then the realization hit me. This is the same man who started off his career with a documentary movie on legendary shock-punk rocker GG Allin called ""Hated"". If anyone hasn't seen that I recommend you do as well as it shows the making of a legend.In conclusion, I think this movie perfectly encapsulates the state of modern western society. That on which is decaying and on it's last legs. Arthur becomes the norm.",0

Joker,"Rewrote my review after the 4th watch of Joker - I've liked jokers before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved... a Joker! Here is why:","Someone said to me that Arthur Fleck chooses to burn the world he's not adapted to, and I answered her: it wasn't a choice. It was an escape, his only true option towards earning some satisfaction, opposed to endless misery he was constantly living in. Arthur never had any joy, or at least some degree of vindication of any kind in ""the normal world"", as this normal world battered and beleaguered him at every turn, putting him down repeatedly as that would be his place. Did he lash out? No, he got up like a good boy, over and over again, dozens of times just to be thrown down again. Until one day, he fought back, surprising himself he could do it! And what do you know? It worked! Shocked by the outcome, he tried again the worlds way, the kind and tolerant way, and the world has again made fun of him, and thus leaving him with the only option that makes him feel something besides it, the only option that works: to fight back, realizing that ultimately the only way you could have some satisfaction in this up world if you are Arthur Fleck, is to rebel against it! And that's funny, especially when you've been such a good boy, trying to do good by everyone! This is the true final paradox, the realization that the answer hit you in the face and you didn't see it all along, and this fact makes him think his life is an actual comedy rather than a tragedy. As I said in my few words of my previous review, the only way The Joker could be the hero is if he would somehow be able to make everyone else seem like the villains! And for the very 1st time, in this majestic masterpiece called Joker, he vilifies the whole society, and from a certain point of view arising the need for it to burn!Of course his life is one of tragedy, one of the cruelest imaginable. The very distance between perpetual humiliation and the choice to fight back being so tiny, but in the same time his inability to see it for so long is what constitutes the final paradox, almost making it sound like a comedy. Throughout the movie he cries while laughing or laughs while crying, but that's not the initial paradox. The initial paradox (reason) is easily spotted by anyone with deep enough empathy: when our human nature isn't able to handle the troubles anymore, pain seems unstoppable and the overflow of negative emotions is handled in opposing fashion. When the more you try, the worse it gets, you have 2 options: either you give up completely and kill yourself or although it hurts, you just laugh it out, you spit fate right in it's face! Arthur has lived this particular emotional paradox way before the action in the movie begins, because living it so many times before, by the time the movie starts the paradox is already part of his conscience, it's already a pathology, that's why when he's feeling unexpectedly sad or edgy, he's sent back in his mind to the paradox, to the uncontrolled laughter. That being the former reason for his behavior, the later being his whole life was a lie, from his detrimental mother to his submissive behavior; once cured from both, he could free himself from the decades of suffering also. The final paradox being the inconceivable: the fight against society bringing him vindication, instead of obvious defeat! Here is where our Joker differs from all of the villains of literature or classical culture, you can't pick a fight with society and win! Well, as it turns out... you can, if you're Joaquin Phoenix! Even his name is somewhat predestined for this, he was a good actor with an accomplished career but nobody had the nerve to call him genius before. And when everyone has forgotten about him, expecting him to die and be buried as an actor that will never know greatness, he arises and slams the door over your face with this Joker! And now, nobody can call him less than a genius, not even those who's brains aren't skilled enough to appreciate the movie.So this is the initial paradox described in detail: you try to do right by your workplace - you're rewarded with laughter and abuse, you try to do a good thing in a buss - you're rewarded with insult and affront, you take good care of your mother, you go to (the super fun) work to provide for her, you wash her, you cook for her, you speak nice to her and listen to her - you find out she abused you when you were a boy without even knowing, that she's crazy, and the ultimate buffer reward of all: she's not even your mother! Notwithstanding the fact you're having a romance with the attractive colored neighbor that lives down the hall, that supposedly can carry you through the rough times, just to be again rewarded with the stupefyingly truth: SUPRISE, IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD! (I lost it there.) There's no way that you wouldn't ultimately laugh at the merit that's completely at odds with the reward given, without fu.king exception! It's way over the stage of complete sadness, it's complete madness, it doesn't make sense, and what do you do when something intense felt doesn't make sense? You laugh. You go back and forth between tragedy and comedy like it's a roller coaster, a confusion trip from which there's no escape! It's no rational confusion, there's nothing wrong with Arthur's reason, it's an emotional confusion, 2 opposite feelings experienced in the same time! If we accept as common practice that we can cry out of sadness, sometimes even out of joy, Arthur teaches us that under extraordinary duress, prolonged indefinitely, one can laugh out of sadness. Moreover so, you can develop a pathology in this regard. What he feels in the moment he realizes everything is a lie is the most choking emotion possible, when you're at your utmost end of your mental supplies, fallen past the edge. I have never quite seen that so well described as in this movie! Arthur's reason is never impaired, no matter how strong negative emotions, they never quite conquer his reason but flow in sink with it, as such, the radical difference between those who kill themselves and him is that he realizes that he still has value, even if nobody notices it, not even his own mother ""Aren't you supposed to be funny, to be a comedian?"". But real or not, he believes ""People are starting to notice!"", even though he is contradicted by the gross reality of his failed stand up comedy. Oddly enough, he's not completely wrong as that sentence starts becoming reality just after he's left without anything more to lose, and forced to act as much as he can in his own defence, as nobody else does! Masterpiece. Need I say more? No problem.Just because he's left better off at the end of this movie than at it's beginning, doesn't mean we're gonna see a happy Joker in Joker 2! Not by a long shot, but strictly comparing him with his Joker one torment, I think he will be considerably better. I am surprised the creator of this movie, being one and the same, has actually decided to make a sequel! No matter how much money you receive from the producer company, to my mind, I can't possibly imagine how you could write a continuation, without tarnishing Arthur's personality shown in Joker 1. You can't turn him directly 150 degrees (considering 30 degrees he's already turned at the end of the 1st movie), a proper solid turn must be made, time and character consuming, because as we should know by now, Arthur cares a lot about ""nobody's people"" that have decency and compassion, even if he doesn't realize it, like he was until just recently, like the dwarf guy is and Arthur kissed him fatherly over his baldness showing his emotions of appreciation ""You're the only one who's ever been kind to me!"", making it blatantly obvious he does not ignore kindness in people. As opposite to what he shots his gun at! Occasionally dips his scissors in. (I like that Jackie Chan moment there, you can use any household item as a weapon - Kung Fu, right?) Joking aside, Arthur's morals are strong and the most obvious when he shouts his heart out on Gotham television ""Nobody thinks how it's to be the other guy!"", motto that in my opinion is the very center of his character! But that doesn't fit one bit with the classic Joker of the comic books or Nolan's Joker from The Dark Knight, it's a totally new approach of a Joker! That's why I love him. And those who think that motto is a joke, deserve more than just a bullet through their infectious thoughts, they would get off too easy! Because they are left way behind on the chapter of emotional inferno and need to be compensated accordingly, in order to understand what's it like! One of them being the rich mayor to be as he calls all of those trapped in this inferno as ""Nothing but clowns!"". But he gets what's coming to him, although a bit more pain wouldn't have hurt rather than complete oblivion that doesn't do him any good, aside from rising later on The Dark Knight. Back to Arthur and his live performance, nobody would have even cared what he shouted on that podium with all his might, if he wouldn't have made a clear point at the end, pointing out who's mean, why and what's coming to them mean ones, exemplified plenty and without any doubt! If he wouldn't have, they would have just thrown him out in the street like a piece of garbage and his words with him.I want to say that another impressive feature is that this movie despite it's visceral drama also has cool comedy in it, some obvious, some noticed at later viewing and exemplify them but I'm running out of character space(..) In conclusion, in my 1st review I said that the scenery is just good enough, but after seeing the movie 4 times I realized just how brilliant it is! Combined with one of the best performances of an actor in the history of cinematography and a sound theme that make your eyes fall off right between your tears, it can't be denied as one of humanity's all time masterpieces. When or if alien races will ever contact us, there's ample reason we are a worthy race, just like Arthur and this movie is my proof towards our humanity's worth.",0
Joker,Am I a joker sympathiser? Yes.,"This is a standalone film for The Joker, to understand his character and really identify with his personality! welcome to the beginning of the end! The film compells you to believe the joker can justify his crimes! That one man does have the power to take down those who abuse their so called "" higher social status""A man whose childhood has been subjected to acts of Evil, and has continued to suffer more subtly throughout his adult life, we as the audience must believe he is out to force that evil upon the world! So that they too, know for a moment, what's it's like to be the victim! This is his reasoning! A coming of age depicts a character created out of pure Evil. A society which has failed to recognise and listen, a society where everything is seen as a product. A society which divides people and forces entertainment to be at the heart of people's lives, sacrificing the expense of another's misery along the way. Anyone with a heart will feel empathy and understanding towards the Joker.Batman is one of my favourite characters, becuase his abilities are not overly far-fetched, and the sense of what could be real is far more believable than having the ability to fly! But truthfully their would be NO BATMAN without the joker.And here you have Joaquin Phoenix portraying the joker in a light never seen before! His performance is remarkable, diverse, captivating and emotional!Honestly, this is the best acting performance I have ever seen, regardless of genre, since solo performances from the likes of Kevin Spacey.I am grateful to be one of the first to have witnessed such a powerful performance in the cinema on it's initial release date! And will continue to discuss this film, whenever the topic of greatest movies/ acting performances arise!Generations after generations after generations, this film should be considered as framework for Drama/Media/ filming students and people whom want to pursue an acting career.Joaquin Phoenix you are a legend! This was a masterclass performance and you deserve all the fame and glory at all the award ceremonies!",0

Joker,The Irishman is less Scorsese than The Joker?,"Picture a world where Taxi Driver meets DC. Honestly, this movie is the closest I've seen to a 10/10 in recent years.WARNING: Do not watch this expecting to see another Dark Knight or Batman Vs Sup! This film is closer to a Scorsese/OldNolan film than a blockbuster film. This is an entirely new take on the Joker so quit comparing it to Ledgers Joker.With a budget of 50 Million dollars, Phillips manages to pull off a phsyc-thriller film set in the 70s with actor Joequin Phoenix as the lead role of Arthur Fleck, the Joker.Phoenix in this movie is truly convincing. The music puts the audience in Arthurs head and the cinematography is superb! Costume design is great with everything in this movie being convincing and complex, yet not complicated enough to lose the audience.This is a must watch movie with many twists and turns, being in the head of Arthur Fleck is an incredibly unique take on mental illness. With scenes questioning and evaluating your own choices in life against other people , which is what every legendary film has managed to achieve.You will definitely not leave the theatres glistening with a joyful smile as if you watched the sun rise, but you will still be satesfied like every reviewer so far. The lowest of ratings will at least say ""You won't regret it""P.s' people giving this movie bad reviews have:Compared it to The Dark KnightA Slow attention span (prefer movies with Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson, and transformers, Shaw and Hobbs)Come in the theatres Super hyped (Sorry)Been paid to give bad reviews",0

Joker,Phoenix is phenomenal,"As an avid DC fan, I have been waiting so long to see this film and last night, I finally did. After all the hype, I was sceptical as to whether or not it would actually meet its potential.
It's safe to say that it scored well above and beyond anything I imagined.
Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. His acting feels very raw; such a troubled character who's played so beautifully. Whilst you will always get the comparative question of ""who's better? Ledger or Phoenix?"" I argue that the two explore completely different stages in the Joker's life and thus are utterly incomparable. Phoenix's performance did not feel like a performance, more-so an observation into the life of a man who I truly felt devastatingly sorry for. His actions of violence seemed like the right thing to do and I almost agreed with the murderous actions he inflicted. Marvel, eat your heart out. You've met your match!4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Went in 4 Weeks after its release day.,"At the moment WB announce Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker I was smiling cause I knew this can't flop. Joaquin is a fabulous actor. I was keen to see him portraying my favorite villain and I think The Joker is the most known and impressive villain ever made.Notes to the people that telling you it's not worth it: Well that's the same people that believes 96 Hours is the best movie they ever seen. They have a limit in taste of movies. Jokes aside don't let them distract you when they say there is no action and clear storyline. It's a drama movie not a highflying stunt movie.I love the atmosphere and the motions Todd Phillips created. This feels so authentic and convincing. As a Batman fan I knew how the Joker the character itself was buildup and the movie catches more viewers who never had watched a Batman movie or read a comic book. Several brillant actor played Joker in their own way and I really don't like people saying: Every Joker portraying was trash, but Heath Ledgers was perfect. The thing is the other Jokers we've seen in the Batman movies were the character already became the movie doesn't show how things made him become The Joker. An advantage for this movie of course !The movie has a strong message for people with mental disease and how much impact humanity and respect for each other has on a person. The movie wouldn't be successful if it wasn't about a DC character.My review might be awful but I'm speechless to go more in detail.Joaquins acting was outstanding. He really made me think he's a psycho. Such a good acting. I wonder what his secrets are for preparing for this role. I wonder how he acted off screen at the set.I really hope this movie gets an Oscar since this is the only top movie of the year I have seen I think the chance is very high.",0

Joker,Finally. Beautiful film is back.,"The most empathetic spiral into a rage fuelled desire to belong in a realistic, cruel but not-so-dissimilar to reality kind of way. Almost a psychological expose on how home grown terrorists feel and are made; how kids end up shooting up schools. This is how. Bullying, ostracism, falling through the cracks of society and extreme disparities in class and privilege lead to the breakdown of society. Brilliantly told and acted, it was reminiscent of Hong Kong's demonstrations (masks and rebellion against power authorities), Escobar-like villainous anti-establishment virtue with a V-for-Vendetta flavour. The best film I've seen in a long time. Didn't think Heath could be outdone but it was. Here's to hoping the Batman franchise is reborn with the same realism and darkness thats always been a tad missing, even under Nolan's direction. This is adult, gritty, real comic which has deeper comments on society and needs to be the new standard in comic based film. Logan (Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine) comes a distant second after Joker.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Never judge a book by its cover!,"I was seriously not interested in that movie after watching some clowns roaming about in the trailer - I'm getting tired of the redundant Purge movies' characters, you know ; and I'm not enjoying the new trend of blurring the lines between good and evil (e.g. Maleficent, 2019). I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when some friends opted for watching it, and I was baffled!The movie was nothing I had expected it to be. It is actually what a Joker backstory should be like. It is believable, intriguing and down to earth. It is really what you can call an adaptation. Todd Phillips manages to make you feel the darkness in Gotham and how it roves through the city in search of the next victim. The whole Batman universe is thus successfully explained. And Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in the role of the Joker.This movie is not really for the usual Batman fan in search of fantasy, fight scenes and high-tech accessories, but for the pragmatic moviegoers who can enjoy watching a masterpiece just like others enjoy French cuisine in a 5-starred restaurant - I'm not kidding!

Joker,"A Unforgettable, Profound, Deeply Moving Masterpiece","This movie was simply beautiful, a masterpiece for all time. I think the reason why so many of us feel pity and - yes - sympathy for Arthur is because to one extent or another we have all experienced tragic moments and sorrow like he has, but we were able to pull out of our dark moments. Unfortunately, he never did.It is a truly realistic portrayal of how a cruel society can send essentially good person into the darkest depths of madness. The movie will not once let your mind drift into distraction as it is mesmerizing and fascinating from the very beginning to the very last moment. Despite the violence, you cannot help but feel for Arthur Fleck - Joaquin Phoenix's character - and may actually root for him, cheering him on in the hope that somehow everything will eventually lead to some form of happy ending for him. You'll have to see the movie to find out if it does.As for the movie reviews, some have been entirely unfair and biased for some strange reason I cannot fathom. One critic from a well known New York publication (btw, I'm from NY, too) criticized it for not being ""fun,"" which makes it absolutely clear that guy has no idea what this movie is about and should probably dedicate himself to something else. If someone is out to see a ""fun"" movie, this masterpiece is not for you. As someone said in another review below, other movies are like going to eat a hamburger; this is more like a $1,000 steak. Fortunately, the success of movies by and large do not depend on film critics but rather on the general public and what we think about them.Regarding the references to Heath Ledger, with all due respect, it's like comparing apples and oranges. I saw his performance, and it was decent for entertainment purposes. But Joaquin Phoenix's performance is simply breathtaking and perhaps unlike anything ever seen before in movie history; Joaquin Phoenix descends into actual madness before our very eyes. He takes us an a journey through the human mind, with moments of light and moments of sad and disconcerting darkness, all while winning over the audience and getting it on his side. It's a depiction of life that we can all relate to in one way or another, which is why his performance is so unique.In terms of movie directing, Todd Phillips needs to be given credit, as he should be for offering us such a masterpiece. I'm sure it will mark and change his directing career.Finally, this is a movie I will see again, and again, and again to the end of my days. My former favorite movie of all time was Planet of the Apes (1968) because it had a deep message about the world and society, one I could relate to even though I was born years later. I think 'Joker' will replace it because it has touched me so deeply. I will simply say it had such an impact on me that I couldn't help but get emotional more than once.",0

Joker,"Masterful, dark, shocking, and strong. An incomparable work, the film of the year.","Joker is a unique, raw and special movie. It is a violent story that shows us the slow descent into madness of our protagonist, Arthur. The movie was incredibly hyped to what runs the year, however, unlike what usually happens with many movies that cause such excitement, this achievement exceed any expectation. This is a movie that definitely deserves any possible ovation to her. An incredible job. It seems fantastic to me to know that the director was able to carry out a work of such quality that it will simply become a milestone in the years to come; it is a unique story, without censorship which shows us the development of a protagonist in such a fluid, effective and fascinating way that we can come to sympathize with such madness, a violent madness, raw and emotional. These words can describe the essence of this film, capable of transmitting ideas and sensations of extreme power and power that nothing can equal.Much has been said about Joaquin's performance, and here I come to repeat the same thing, because he simply deserves it: It's incredible, it's perfect. This is the Joker that is capable of existing in this world, a performance as strong as human, a cruel and realistic touch gives enough support for us to understand the motivations of the character, who is not only a villain with a goal, or an idea, it is the explosion caused by the spark of madness. The acting is just sublime, and I'll say it at once; it's time for his Oscar.Incredible, fantastically dark, every minute of this film is a work of pure passion, effort and attention to detail, you can more than notice the incredible work that has been put into it. Everything is simply fascinating, the direction, the incredible script, the beautiful cinematography, the masterful performance, the deep soundtrack, the emotional scenes, the fluid development, and so on.Joker is a masterpiece.

Joker,Phoenix=Brilliant,"Went into this movie not knowing what to expect. The hype surrounding it was overwhelming but it lived up to it. Brilliant case study surrounding Arthur Fleck's transition into the joker. What separates this from other superhero/villain movies is there is no suspension of disbelief. Every event and action could have plausibly taken place and that's what's so chilling about the movie. It really causes one to sit back and reflect on the nature of our society in creating the situations in the movie. Acting was brilliant, on par with Ledger.

Joker,"Awesome, mesmerising, masterclass in acting.","Wow, in the words of the song, I wasn't expecting that!I thought it would be like Batman but there is nothing comic book about this!I'm a mental health crisis nurse with 21 years experience and I'm sad to say that this is a true reflection of community care as a result of years of the Tory regime.We used to have case study videos at Uni but this tops them all.It is the perfect portrayal of a man with antisocial personality disorder who is consistently let down by the system and slips through the net with disastrous consequences.Everything about this film is genius.Mr Phoenix, words fail me, apart from he is one magnificently gifted individual. A breathtaking performance.The film is very very dark, very very depressing but so gripping and engaging.Ignore the hype about people walking out and the glorification of violence, it's nonsense. Watch the average horror movie and that will be much more bloody and violent than this and if anyone were to wear a clown's mask and try to copy then they are seriously in need of help.Don't watch this if you're expecting a typical comic book film, but if you're after an adult, mature and true to life character depiction, then watch this.Awesome.",0
Joker,Joker is gonna mess with your mind!,"Easily became my favorite film of all time. When it was first announced that Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Joker a was a bit sceptical. But his performance was the best ever! Suited him perfectly with a great origin story movie for a villain. This is a story of how a man goes completely mad so if you expect to see full on savage Joker early on try to focus on Arthur Fleck and how his psychology changes with every punch he takes from society which is actually affects you as well. Todd Philips did a brilliant job, every shot of the film was breathtaking for me. Especially that first scene of Arthur with clown make up in the bathroom dancing.

Joaquin was responsible for making this character.. so believably believable! His ability, to become the Joker, left me in awe of his acting.

Joker,Why you should absolutely see this movie,"I Was not expecting this movie to be such a masterpiece at every single level. It is truly what a movie should be: transporting you in the psyche of someone that is not you and make you relate to this person in some strange way. I'm speechless by how incredible it was, how I was taken by surprise...
We knew Phoenix to be a great actor for twisted vilain since Gladiator , but now it is going to be impossible to imagine the Joker without him playing it.
There is such depth in his acting, such a raw interpretation of mental illness. I'm just baffled how he is able to carry the movie and this level of intensity from the first minute to the last one on -almost- a stand alone performance. Very impressive performance that make some A list actors look like amateur who can only play themselves.
As an origin story for the joker, it brings so much depth to this DC character and thinking of the Joker now in previous Batman movie, make him become such an interesting vilain.As a final note, I loved how they twisted the birth of Batman and kept the previous work done with Batman begins coherent but slightly different.I thought before that DC was doing a poor job transposing their universe and character to the big screen (except for Batman Begins) but man, this movie changed my mind!
Congrats to all the team who work on making this move a reality, and a standing ovation to Mr Phoenix for granting us of such an acting performance.

Joker,"Critics, give me a break please.","Lately, most movies have been adapted to be ""friendly"" for most viewers, lacking of depth, darkness and other ingredients. People and critics specified that movies (specially Disney-action movies) had to sacrifice some darkness and/or reality in order to make them user friendly for most audiences.
Then comes The Joker. It ignores any aspect of the ""audience friendly"" scheme and jumps into reality, darkness and all these aspects that we were so desperetely waiting for in other movies. This movie is graphic and crude in a lot of senses but thats what makes it so perfect. Todd Phillips didnt try to make it fit for all audiences. However, I've sene a lot of critics out there ripping into this film for being fuel for other things and for the strong content shown. Please decide what is it that you want because if you are looking for movies that ""fit"" most audiences, then you should be looking at a different franchise.

It made the Joker more than a character but a believable being that could live down the street, ride your bus, or work in your city. You travel with him down a dark hole until he reaches the point you'd expect in this scenario, yet still I found it unpredictable. This is a must see for any fan and truly the best Joker there has ever been.

Joker,"Dark, Deep, Moving, and a Psychological Masterpiece","As a student of psychology, Joker has found a way to see the slow decay of a individual suffering from psychosis, psychotic tendencies, narcissism, the need to belong, and finding pleasure in the darkest of places.
This movie isn't for everyone. It is very dark. There isn't a happy ending. Yet the acting and story-line can be appreciated for the moving story it portrays. As the Joker portrays one with a severe mental illness, this movie at least offers insight on the real struggles that exist in those with mental health problems, while still offering a masterful way to depict the origin story of the world's greatest super villain.

One half terrifying, one half sympathy-evoking, and 100% believable, Phoenix delivers more than the audience could have ever asked for.

Joker,IT'S NO JOKE.,"The best thing about this movie is how we see the world through Arther Fleck's eyes (who will transform psychologically to become Joker) and not through a narrator's perspective. That alone makes this movie so unique coz it's the first time that is done with a character that is so villainous and so popular like Joker.
No need to speak about how great Joaquin Phoenix's performance is. It's an Oscar worthy in my opinion. It's so hard - if not impossible to top him this year.
The director did a tremendous job to deliver the darkness and grittiness of Gotham City in a deep touching way. That makes you get sucked into that world. Photography is another spectacular aspect of this movie.

Joker,Joker is a masterpiece,"Intense, unnerving film that caused real dialogue between myself and the person I saw the film with. Don't quite understand the controversy surrounding it and I admit it won't be a film that everyone will love (has a pace that some may consider slow). Really interesting character study that Phoenix absolutely nails. I understand it won't happen, but would love to see more Gotham villains get this type of standalone origin film treatment. Love that Gotham was utilized as more than just the backdrop.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Joker - The honest human review,"I will attempt to provide a spoiler free opinion.. here it is.Joker is for all intents and purposea a masterpiece. I went in with very high expectations but I was not prepared for this.
In the past years I saw msnu PC movies, superhero movies and overall movies without soul that were vrry highly regarded, but this one here has all I was missing.
Cinematography is exceptional, I saw at least 4-5 scenes that were absolutly suberb, in acting and imaging. Those type of scenes that you rembember and have goosebumps over.
Sound, while not the best or memorable (at least not at first watch) as were The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream and others, it is still top notch and more important were perfectly match with what I was seeing.
Last and clearly not least, Joaquin Pheonix....I read and seen quite a bit before going in ""ohhh people are walking out of the movie or it is bad...not PC enough, apolitical. ...etc"" all those messages are from critics that honestly follow a crooked agenda. My truth is I saw acting like I did not see for a loooong time. The descent inyo madness is palpable, relatable and real. Mr. Pheonix is incredible, suberb, breathtaking! An Oscar performance and while I gave it a 10 to counter this lowlifes agenda spewers the movie is a strong 9.Go watch this, I am sure you will have a great experience. One of the few movies that deserves your money and time",0
Joker,It's not the Joker you know but the movie is brilliant,"Hold right there. And drop all your superheroes preconceptions. This is not a summer dumb fun action super villain movie. It's something else.A reinterpretation of Joker. And it's harrowing in its grittiness and potential. You will be there in the streets of Gotham, a Gotham that feels more real than any other fictional city on screen. Because little does it matter where the events happen on screen. This Joker can be anyone, anywhere.A perfect score in movie means more than just a great story. For me it means the character, the performance, the build-up. And all of them are beautifully done. Especially the build-up. Maybe some will think it's too slow, but I was glued to the screen the whole time.Of course, I still have some complaints, but most of them are because of my view on the Joker. As the classic Joker, I think Heath Ledger is still the best but he was helped by the script. The Joker's background should not be known, that's what makes the character so unpredictable.But Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is the people's hero, a deranged hero for a deranged society.",0
Joker,"Joker Is Impactful: Dark, Tense and Profoundly Sad","Joker was one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time: dark, tense and profoundly sad. I spent the bulk of my time while watching this film either on the edge of tears or in a state of pre-panic. The cinematography was gorgeous, the soundtrack amazing, and the acting was award-worthy.

Joker,The Taxi Driver of Comicbook Movies,"Joker is a Taxi Driver type moment for the Comicbook movie genre its just as nuanced just as controversial and just as dark, violent and dirty as Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece, it also has deep deep threads linking it to a whole host of other mid to late 70's and early 80's classics like Friedkins The French Connection or another Scorsese classic The King Of Comedy its abit on the nose with some of its influences but it never takes away from the overall originality of Phoenix's performance or the movie in general it feels more like Todd Phillips paying respects to a wonderfully provocative and risky era in filmmaking, Todd Phillips is really masterful and mature with the camera here his direction is steady when needed and slightly more chaotic in chase sequences like William Friedkin with his chase scenes in The French Connection, Phillip's use of the close up here is much appreciated to so you can see and feel every facset of what is an absolutely riveting performance from Joaquin Phoenix he channels so much energy into Arthur so much so Phoenix vanishes for 2 hours and it's only when the credits role you realise he was acting its astonishing work well worthy of an Oscar nomination if not a win although knowing the hacks over at the Academy they will no doubt buckle under the pressure of media outrage and deny him. From the powerful score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir to the wonderfully framed and gorgeous Cinematography by Lawrence Sher Joker is a rare treat not often seen in cinema today yet alone in the Comicbook movie genre it's a fantastic movie and it should be seen by as many people as possible so we can get more challenging and nuanced films in what is such a rich and deep universe. Joker is The Taxi Driver of the Comicbook Movie its bold, dark and controversial and we need more movies like it. 10/10 A Masterpiece.",0

Joker,Best Movie of the Year,"There are many things that can be said about this movie, and going in there was a lot of talk about social commentary and how the movie will spark a violent event, but not one thing came across as something trying to trigger someone into acting out against society. It's just a movie, and a great one at that. I don't need people deciding my morals and movies don't either, it's just for entertainment, and this just that, but in a very uncomfortable way. I have never seen someone carry a movie in such a way that Joaquin Phoenix did. The way he moved, the way he held himself, to the way he contorts his body in an visibly painful way. It just screams commitment and pure talent. I just wish it wasn't a standalone film. The violence and gore in the movie is only in like 4 scenes but with such surprise and effect that those few scenes are burned into your memory. Robert Dinero gave a wonderful take on being a daily night time show host, and really is the best performance in a long time for him. This movie was truly uncomfortable, emotional, and really showed every layer of joker that really was never shown before. Every part of the movie slowly progressed Arthur Fleck into the joker, and if any part was removed, then the joker wouldn't have made any sense. It just shows how perfectly done the character arch of Joker was. I don't think there will ever be a movie with such respect to detail to the chain of events that led to his final form as Joker.",0
Joker,"A Chilling Ballet of Mental Illness, That Dances Between Life's Tragedies","The Joker is not a comic book movie, but rather a master class in character study. The film follows your lead Arthur Fleck or ""The Joker"". You're told the story through his eyes, and through this lens it is easy to find Arthur extremely sympathetic. Jaoquin Phoenix's portrayal, coupled with Todd Phillip's writing had made for a character who holds onto your attention the whole film. There wasn't a moment of the film I wasn't in awe, when the score would slowly creep in to give you chills over a scene that was previously completely silent, or still shots of hallways, and stair cases as Arthur is alone in frame, just to give you a gripping sense of loneliness throughout the film. Though the plot can be fairly predictable, it's how those moments play out that are surprising. You feel like you know something will happen one way and it does happen never in the way you feel it will though. The script can often times be dull for some, but to me I saw these moments as cold, hard bits that look into Arthur's psychy. Like a scene in which Arthur is in a comedy club and doesn't get what's funny and what's not so he just laughs, none of the jokes are really funny, but they're supposed to be things we know are supposed to be funny so we see that Arthur doesn't understand. There are other jokes that aren't laugh out loud hilarious, but are just funny enough to get you to think they are, and then immediately, a like of dialogue comes in to make you feel bad about laughing about that.The best things I can say about this film can't be said without spoiling it, all I can say is that it is a cold, gritty horror film about the horrors of the human psyche that'll leave you uncomfortable towards the end, with many questions about yourself left in your head after just one viewing.",0

Joker,A MASTERPIECE,"This is the movie of the year if not the decade! A masterful directing from Todd Phillips, the photography, the music are also outstanding.
But what is breathtaking, is Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. He has been an outstanding actor worth at least an Oscar already (for The Gladiator, The Master, Inherent Vice and so on). But his Joker will be taught in film schools. You don't see such a performance too often or never see one.
On the other hand, about the film, it's a standalone movie but if you know the Batman Universe you understand small details better.

Joker,Send in the clowns.,"Thanks to it premiering on the festival circuit and all of the recent discourse surrounding its content, Joker is a film that feels as if it has been out for ages when in fact it's only just been released this weekend. My anticipation for its release was already sky-high but had only been heightened by the media claiming it to be a dangerous film to release to the public and the rise in security presence at recent premiere screenings in America however, does the film even deserve all the discourse it's seen before its release?Having been disregarded by society, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown-for-hire, descends into a life of crime and infamy.There's a deeply unsettling sense of impending violence that flows throughout Joker from start to finish, Arthur's descent towards a life of crime depicted in incredibly visceral fashion. It's a ticking time-bomb of a film that hones in on the mental state of its titular character and how he's viewed by society, Todd Phillips and Scott Silver not holding back in making Gotham a horrible place for Arthur to reside.The production design ensures Gotham feels very much a character playing a part in Arthur's downward spiral, as does Lawrence Sher's glum cinematography and Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's minimal yet rather haunting score.Joker is elevated to great heights by a mesmerisingly magnetic lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who yet again showcases why he is arguably the best actor working today with a performance for the ages. It's such a devastatingly beautiful performance that's both hard to watch at times yet hard to take your eyes off, Phoenix surely the man to beat come awards season.He's certainly the main attraction on show in Joker but he's dealt some stellar support from the likes of Robert De Niro, embracing the cheesy flair of his character, and Zazie Beetz, offering Arthur a glimmer of hope in his otherwise downbeat life.Joker really is a stunning character study from Todd Phillips, unflinching in its approach and deeply unsettling in its execution, the performance from Joaquin Phoenix in particular making it a film that will certainly leave a lasting impression.",0

Joker,Masterpiece!!!,"First of all, please do not compare Joaquin Phoenix's Joker with Heath Ledger's Joker. We are lucky to see two actors playing a very difficult character of Joker brilliantly in their own ways. They are both so good, they are both legends!In terms of movie, Joker origin story is something very new and very much needed. It has always been emphasized in the DC world that Gotham was irredeemable, that the people were so corrupted that the city was beyond saving. But the reason behind it was never shown. The story has always been told from Batman's point of view. This storytelling is so brilliant, you really sympathize and understand why Joker is what it is. If you see Dark Knight just after this, Joker's love for chaos will make total sense.It's good to see such a realistic cinema with characters having so much depth. The level of acting and movie making is legendary. Hats off!Yes the hype is real. Do not miss this masterpiece.",0

Joker,My Quick review over the movie,"I watched Joker on IMAX yesterday sitting on the the best seats which means that I already known that this movie is gonna be amazing. How? Well, I watched the Master months ago which the only thing that in my eyes was well to watch, it was the Phoenix's acting in this movie.
This ensured me about his acting skills and his integrity as an actor that this movie is gonna be amazing. I was expecting something as good as this Joker, which it has honestly gone over my expectations. Firstly, Todd Phillips has done a masterpiece. Congratulations to him. He can boast anyone with this perfect directing of his. It is clear enough from the movie that he did not consent to any bad impression, any bad part that could be showing this movie as an ordinary film throughout the world. He targeted his efforts to create a perfect movie, to be a part of history. I believe he has achieved it already.
Secondly, the music of this movie just fits the mood and angles of the movie. This is one of the most important and common parts of any amazing movie. For Example, Interception would never be The Interception without Hans Zimmer making the music. Well in this movie, also I have seen great moves from a composer, which it definitely helped me to feel the emotions of such complex character (Joker), plot and the mood of each scene of the film. It is a well done composing by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir. She deserves some great awards for her art in this film.Thirdly, the script and plot of the story which makes the audience to be fully concentrated on the character of Joker and his feelings. It is more dramatic than a ""DC"" or a ""comic"" movie. This plot answers many questions about Joker's originality. The plot is amazing as well in which it keeps you guessing about the future scenes. Also, the fact that even after the film, it keeps you thinking about the theory after the ending and the moral of the story, makes this work of art, a special work of art.Fourthly, the coloring of the movie, the filmmaking, the screen display, the camera shots, the sounds, the special effect, the lighting and etc. All of them has don't the best they could do and make a stunning result. There is nothing say about them else than admiring the whole crew for bringing such an art to our eyes.
Lastly, The ACTING. For me, personally, I don't like a slow going plot. A smooth story telling plot is super boring for me. But, for this movie, the only and only thing that keeps me watching the movie without blinking is Joaquin Phoenix. His acting is just WOW! The most impressive thing about this movie, the most significant thing that make the movie, looks realistic is his indubitable, indisputably acting. His acting is phenomenal. For me it's just a question, HOW DID HE DO THAT??!! I can never act like that. It is super difficult to even understand the Joker's character. How did he act like that?! I believe This is his best roll ever, and one of the best actings ever. (At least in top 5) He deserves to get the best awards for his roll in this movie, and he is definitely comparable with Heath Ledger. His acting is full of emotions, filled with unreleased anger, full of simplicity and humanity, filled with oppression, his laughs are with meaning, his eyes are full of un dropped tears and his chest is full of unspoken words. He doesn't understand the people. He relies on their humanity, he trusts them and yet, he gets beaten by them, he gets betrayed and he gets suffocated. He has never found Love he always wanted. Everyone, disrespected him and manipulated him through his life. He has seen insincerity hurting him to his bones. And, when he gets to the top, when he finds his way to feel better, to be recognized, you can still see that he is confused and new to this stage of life. This is just perfect. One of the best actors of all time, I would name him.The moral of the movie is so deep and it is full of unfortunate and painful truths. It's an unreal but at the same time real tragedy.This movie can change a lot of people's mindset in different countries. If you have seen this film, please stop judging and discriminating other people. If you have not, you are missing a great masterpiece! Enjoy!",0
Joker,One of the most gripping cinema experiences in years,"I was never overly hyped for this movie, though the expectations after seeing the first trailer were high. After seeing it at the opening day, it definitely surpassed any expectations I had. Yes, the title might be read and experienced as the Taxi Driver of 21st century. But at the same time it is much, much more. The best Joker movie that could have been made, dark, enthralling, moody, making you constantly uncomfortable. Great acting from Joaquin Phoenix, total embodiment of the loneliness, fragmentation and psychosis of the character and its slow turning into the clown prince of crime. By far the best movie based on comic book material and characters that has been ever made, surpassing what Nolan did in his trilogy. Though Ledger was great in the Dark Knight, the one that truly captures the essence and psychology of the Joker is this performance of Phoenix. A must seen movie, whereas the controversy around the themes of violence, anarchy and disputing of the existing order and paradigm in society should not be something that stops any true cinema lover from seeing this - go and experience for yourself a new landmark in the transfer of the comic books material to the medium of the 7th art. A true masterpiece of modern cinema.",0

Joker,Joaquin Deserves An Oscar For His Brilliant Performance,"Heath Ledger raised the bar with his Joker performance, but I knew that if anyone could nail this role it would be Joaquin Phoenix.
I saw Joker and I absolutely loved it! This movie does not have all the action packed scenes we are use to seeing, it focuses more on character and the genesis of the Joker.
Don't walk into the theater expecting and comparing him to Heath Ledger's performance, expect to see Joaquin Phoenix giving an Oscar worthy performance with his masterful take on it.
In yo face Marvel! As much as I enjoy the Marvel universe, in my personal opinion none of those actors can pull off a performance like Joaquin in Joker.
This movie proves that you don't need all the syfy and special effects to make a movie great, it has solid acting by a brilliant actor.
Doesn't look like he would do another one but it would be awesome if he did.

Joker,Favourite film of all time!,"It is the perfect combination between Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"", however ""Joker"" is a unique and original character study masterpiece! Todd Phillips did a marvelous job with the character, origin story, and film!
About Joaquin's interpretation i can't say it is the best or my favourite of all time, because that would mean to compare it to other interpretations, and that would be a huge insult for Joaquin Phoenix! What he did in this film is absolutely uncomparable!! No award can express the real value of this interpretation!4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,The reality is what's terrifying... I think,"It was heavy, spent most of the time with my hand over my mouth, and thinking about what I think about this movie. Seen so many disturbing stuff in films, people getting eaten alive in the worst ways by zombies, cannibalism, skinning, etc. yet this movie made someone getting shot and someone getting stabbed the maybe most disturbing thing I've ever witnessed. I have deduced because it was so real. The insanity expressed was so real, it left me so uncomfortable. Felt like DC let out their pent up rage towards Marvel... kinda kidding. But basically this movie deserves the revolutionary hype it's getting, and this is coming from someone who was skeptical of all the praise.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Just....wow!!!!,"Just came back from seeing this film and feel that my high expectations were exceeded. Joker is a rarity I feel. It is a commercial film that is taken from a comic book character but actually has something to say. It is by far the best DC film since Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy but it feels less like a comic book film than a character study. And it is. And yes I have read that it has been said that it borrows heavily from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy and it does in that it presents the Arthur Fleck character as a loner, outsider, mostly shunned by people around him just like Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin. It is definitely a film that follows that slow burn into insanity and violence like those films but it's not a bad thing.By now everyone knows that this film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur, and through the film we see his transformation into The Joker. It is an origin story. He plays Arthur as a thin, weak disturbed person who is treated badly by those around him. And he slowly grows to have truly disturbing thoughts and actions. The film is a comic book film in that it is about s character that comes from that medium but it is in no way a light film. Avengers Endgame this is not. And I revere that film but i think that it is great that they decided to not sugar coat this story and tried to go deeper and make it more about the psychology of the character as opposed to his criminal antics. That Todd Phillip's a comedy director took this on and did it with such success is stunning. I will avoid all.of thr controversy that has come from this film saying that it condones violence. It is violent and disturbing but in no way compares to other films that are much worse. I like that it went for an adult theme and is rated R. My kid will.not be seeing this anytime soon. Great film, great performance. Period.One last thing. I know that Phoenix's Joker is inevitably going to be pit against Heath Ledger's interpretation of the character. Some saying that this is better. I think that it is different, not better. Ledger was THE JOKER. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck becoming THE JOKER. The performances stand on their own as great but I still favor Ledger just a bit more. But not by alot.",0

Joker,Interesting how the mainstream media has had such a negative response to this,"I thought this was an incredible movie, and I'm shocked that mainstream reviews have been so negative. I personally think it's because of the social commentary that's so pervasive throughout it. I read one review from NBC I think that said this movie had no point or substance, which of course anyone who's watched it would know is total b.s. They aren't stupid; they know that this was a critique of the elite (among other things). You had sympathy for him, while still being incredibly uncomfortable watching it.
This movie was very intense and disturbing. There was nothing entertaining about it. It kept me up most of the night. Everything about it was well-done, and it's unfortunate it isn't getting the response it should from film critics, but again, I think we all know why that is.
Also, I thought the emphasis on mental illness was very profound. I liked the part where he wrote down something like ""Why is it that when you have a mental illness people expect you to behave as if you don't?""4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,People need to stop comparing to Heath Ledger. Joaquin gave a fantastic performance. Period.,"I dont understand why do people have this urge to compare the 2 jokers. Todd phillips shows us the slow descent of a loner into madness, whereas Nolan's Joker show the level of menace Joker could go to. Both are fantastic, but when the fools start to compare, they are not comparing apples to apples. Ofcourse Joaquin's role as Joker wont be as crazy, menacing & fear inducing as Heath Ledger's coz he is still coming to terms with being Joker. Anyways, with almost 95% of the screentime for one character alone, this movie was fantastic & lived up to my expectation of Joker. Some people would also be cheesed about the fact that there is a hugeee departure from the comic book, but i respect Todd's vision.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Complicated, DEEP, different, unusual and thought provoking!","Let me start by saying that when I left the cinema, I felt that I liked the movie a lot, and at the same time I felt disgusted by it. Maybe it's the portrayal of a broken man that has been put over the edge and gets really violent and crazy that left me feel that way.This movie offers a LOT of things to think about about our society, about our life in general and the way we treat the weak among us. I think this movie TRULY depicts how a psychopath is formed and the consequences this brings.The Joker is not ""likeable"" character but in many cases I think the public can explain his actions as being reasonable and logic.The movie is very, very, very deep and it's not just for entertainment purposes. I advise the public watching it have the mindset that they will be watching something truly different and not think of it as the latest Hollywood flick, because it is not.The movie is so deep I believe you have to watch it 2-3 times to grasp it.The acting is not great - it's UNBELIEVABLE! Joaquin MUST win Oscar with this. Movies like this are very rare and far in between. I hope more people can understand it because this is a complicated movie and I fear the broad audience won't grasp it's meaning.",0

Joker,Joaquin has achieved the seemingly impossible!,"I've seen every cinematic portrayal of the Joker so far and never thought I'd find myself saying anyone played the character better than Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix's version of the clown villian has matched and in my opinion exceeded that of The Dark Knight's. Phoenix keeps you mesmerised from start to finish, and you become totally enveloped in his story and character development.
Although Joker links in the Batman/Wayne storyline, do NOT go to the cinema expecting a comic book movie - this is a character driven drama and not one for the kids, with some pretty brutal scenes. Joaquin Phoenix is a tour de force in this movie, if he doesn't receive an Oscar for Joker it will be a travesty.

Joker,JOKER,"This movie was fantastic in my opinion. Plenty of critics hated on the way this movie was blandly reimagined from films like Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy, two films I thoroughly enjoyed. I thought the film had its own piece of uniqueness especially with Phoenix's amazing performance. From the first minute I was captivated and I loved what Joaquin and Todd were able to do with this character. The soundtrack and score for this movie was also very impressive. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir did a fantastic job and the score never felt over the top to me. Did I like Taxi Driver better, yes, but from a technical and film perspective. I do think, however, that this film manages to capture something that Taxi Driver doesn't and that is the unique saneness and personality of the character we know of as the JOKER.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,A Cinematic Masterpiece. An Outstanding Performance By Joaquin.,"10/out of MF 10. Forget the media fear mongering. This was a relatable film because I am a female with some mental health issues and it covered that aspect with respect and the troubles that go along with being cut off of medication & services. Joaquin's performance is indeed Oscar worthy (not that it even matters to him) and it is on par with Ledger's. It also comes together nicely with a twist I didn't expect in the Batman universe. Anyone who has an issue with this cinematic masterpiece should stick to PG fluffy bunny Marvel films because this Alan Moore material is for us big kids. Go see this film.
Also on a side note I attended the movie with 3 other female friends who all LOVED it so this media outrage about it being only for a certain demographic is completely ridiculous.

When Joaquin phoenix was cast as joker I was a sceptical but after watching this film I can confidently say, he has full justice to this iconic character. His Maniac laugh, his mood swings, his dancing, makeup everything is perfect.
Now, joker is not a superhero movie it's more like a psychological thriller. It's dark and haunting and at times very disturbing. The background music is great and even though the story is slow paced, it has some surprises.
If you are a joker fan like me you will love it, if you love great cinema, you will love it.

Joker,Irresistible content!!!!,"Joker who tries to spread happiness and joy to everyone, faced the harsh cruelties of life and lack of empathy from everyone. This movie basically shows the 1980s' America, when CCTV Cameras were not there and the grotesque and hideous act took place every now and then. He, who has mental disorder and uncontrollable-hysterical laughter, when pushed on the brink, comes out to be a sociopath and sadist. This movie basically show the harsh reality of today's world, where everyone is looking for their own benefit. No one is ready to see others' condition or show empathy. The plot of the movie is intriguing, strong and practical. Camera angles are totally perfect -like they even show the hand and legs movements of The Joker, whenever he feel excruciating, the ending of the movie is wonderfully captured- I mean the ending of the movie will make an impact on you even after the movie. Eventually, every single second of this movie is totally worth watching. Don't want to spoil anything because this is the irresistible content.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,This is my favourite Joker.,"If you haven't watched this movie then your missing out big time.Heath Ledger done a amazing job as the Joker in the Dark Knight.
In this Movie Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker and he done a excellent job, he starved himself so that he could play the part and that deserves mad props. In this film the Joker is way more dark
and creepy. The movie at first can be a little confusing for some people but a second watch will fix that.Thank you for reading my review.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,This may be one of the most important works of mainstream art in our time.,"The only emotion I was able to understand after watching this film for the first time was disturbed. It invoked one of the longest and thought-provoking conversations I've had after watching a film. One of the biggest being its portrayal of mental illness, which may have been the most realistic I've seen, and the graphic violence. Only after watching it a second time did I realize how little violence there is in the film. The way Todd Phillips was able to make the viewer feel so strongly about the protagonist's journey throughout is a testament to him, Joaquin Phoenix and anyone involved in the film, especially the way the cinematographer used colors. It balanced an original story and comic book origin story flawlessly and after the second viewing, was able to look past it's 'not so' graphic nature and understand everything Arthur was going through and was somehow able to empathize and disagree with a character at the same time as they slipped into madness. This may be one of the most important works of mainstream art in our time.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

How can it score lesser than a ""trashy"" movie like Last Jedi?Are the critics the only ones with the brains or artistic appreciation to rate movies?

Joker,The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't,"First of all I'd like to say ""HATS OFF TO TODD PHILIPS AND JOAQUIN PHOENIX"". If you're a cinephile and haven't seen this movie on the bug screen, you're missing something!
The movie explores the life of Arthur Fleck and shows us how an ordinary man becomes the JOKER.
Daringly dark, this movie left me and many others speechless! No one was clapping when it ended, because the movie itself is a slap on the face of society! Everyone EVERYONE is a result of circumstances. This movie doesn't care about anything, it doesn't sugarcoat lies, it doesn't confuse reality with fiction, it takes the reality and puts a fictous yet amazingly real-like story in it! Do we take mental illness seriously? NO. Does this movie warns us of the consequences? YES. Should we relate to this movie and feel sympathy for Joker? NO. You know what ignorance and suppression leads to? It leads to JOKER!
Coming to the cinematic aspects of the movie, believe me when I say this, ""Joaquins acting was TOP TIER""! Credit goes to Todd Philips too for creating an amazing yet dark environment and daring to implement this story! Cinematography was on point and in fact one of the best that I've seen! I'm saying this again because no matter how many tines I say this it won't be enough, Joaquin acted as if he WAS Joker! This performance tops that of ""Her"" and will always live in cinematic history as one of the best EVER!
It would be needless to say that you should see this because YOU SHOULD SEE THIS!
Talking about my experience in cinema, I was shocked and SHAKING when the movie ended! The last 15 mins of the movie were one of the finest and intense piece of cinema ever made!
Joker shakes the society, slaps it's face, and puts forward a question, ""Where are we going as a society?""",0
Joker,"This movie is beautiful, Joaquin Phoenix Would Make Heath Ledger Proud","This movie is beautiful. The message they deliver is immediately felt: it's portraying our society as a whole in the movie. This shows us exactly how some people are treated with disrespect, and being completely isolated as if they're not even a human being.Not only that, but Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal as Arthur Flex is astounding. You can see the high amount of time, and effort he's put on to being this character. He really hits home in the laughing, shows Arthur's struggles immensely with society in every scene. Phoenix also does an amazing job showing the descent into madness slowly, which just makes you feel even more terrible for the character Arthur Fleck, and what society had done to him. He really might've made Heath Ledger smiling down at him, saying: ""you've restored my Joker legacy"".Speaking of the descent into Joker, that was also handled very well. We first start off seeing Arthur as a weak, willed character. He slowly walks up the stairs in a weird, almost saddened way. He has a shaky voice, and almost zero confidence in himself. Arthur was pretty much broken down: a human that society treated as non-existent.However, when he becomes Joker, we immediately see he's happy as can be, dancing to his own music in his head down the steps as shown in the trailer and the movie. He actually feels more confident, not scared to express himself, albeit in a twisted way of course.I suggest you give this masterpiece a watch, you won't regret it.",0

Joker,Open up your empathy and you will be hurt deeply,"One of the best, maybe even the best, movies I have seen in the last and in this year so far. A misunderstood movie if you read the reviews on the news. Is it brutal? Yes. Is it shocking? Yes. Does it cheer people up to become violent? No. This movie asks the audience to look behind the obvious. It asks us to reflect ourselves, as the person we are on our own and the society we builded up. As an empath I was deeply touched and hurt by the suffering of Arthur Fleck, the main character. His development is relatable and performed brilliantly by a Joaquin Phoenix in best form. JP is transforming in both characters, Arthur and then becoming more and more the Joker, so very commiting that it will take your breath. The score underlines perfectly the feelings of the main character and if you open up, this movie will get under your skin. It is an emotional ride with social criticism at it's realest.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Excellent example of mental health portrayal in film!,"Aside from the storytelling of how the Joker came to be, this film beautifully captured the true essence of what it means to be living with a mental illness in a society that struggles to accept and understand it. The inaccuracies and exaggerations that come with the portrayal of mental illness in movies are all things we are prone to see and unfortunately fuel the stigma surrounding mental illness. It's refreshing to see a movie that tackles that stigma at its core by showing problems with society itself and how society treats individuals struggling with mental illness. It's very possible to merge entertainment with education and this movie exceeded that. While addressing issues like societal judgement and unhelpful medical staff, we were able to see it conveyed in a way that was also interesting and entertaining to see. The aspect that resonated with me the most was when Arthur called his therapist out for not listening and asking the same questions every week. Another aspect I found particularly interesting was how even though Arthur made efforts to get help and treatment, he wasn't given help when his therapist informed him that funding cuts were being made and he wouldn't be able to continue seeing her. Keeping the momentum of going to treatments and trying to get better is a long struggle that takes a lot of effort and work. Not being given the proper resources or support to keep that treatment can also be extremely detrimental and many are unfortunately put in this position. There are many individuals struggling with mental illness that do not have the resources to get help. I'm glad this point was reinforced in this film because there are individuals that want and seek help but simply do not have the resources to continue or find it. What made this movie unique was its ability to speak to a large audience, not only those struggling with mental illness but also those seeking to understand those that do. One of the ways Joaquin Phoenix prepared for his role was he studied up on how to portray Arthur's mental health struggles in the most accurate ways possible. One of the best ways we can tackle the stigma is to show more accurate portrayals and working alongside mental health professionals or psychologists so actors can portray those characters in the most accurate ways possible. While there are no justifications for Arthur's crimes, we did see how lack of empathy and support influenced the way he saw the world. The world can be a very cruel place, but the most important thing we can do is extend a helping hand to a stranger to spread a little joy in the world.",0

Joker,Disturbingly Realistic and Intense,"Wow. Joker is easily the best movie I've seen in a long time. I started watching it on my TV yesterday and was so disturbed by it I turned it off, not sure whether I'd finish watching it. Of course I did, today.What made it so intense for me, besides what makes it so intense for everyone, is that I worked in state mental hospitals for many years and personally knew criminally insane people. Also, I lived in Manhattan during the 70's and the mood, background and vibe portrayed in the film was spot on. When I read afterward that it was supposed to be '81, I was surprised because it appeared and felt so much like the 70's. Besides the shabby condition of the city back then, the whole political thread replete with looting and rioting suggested the great blackout of '77 and its aftermath, not to mention that iconic 70's film, Taxi Driver.As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance well, there's nothing original to say here. His portrayal of a psychotic man was phenomenal. In fact, I had a boyfriend in the '70's who looked like Arthur and while he was crazy, he was the picture of sanity compared to Arthur/Joker.Joaquin had a great script to work with. As a would-be screenplay writer myself, I have a great deal of admiration for Todd Phillips and Scott Silver. In particular the pacing of the script was fantastic, especially the way the details of the past were revealed well into the film. I experienced a sense of ah, now I understand, learning that Arthur's compulsive laughing arose from brain damage sustained during a beating from mom's boyfriend, also that he had a very painful and abusive childhood which explained a lot. There was an amazing sense of development and growing intensity of the character and his madness. Yes, it was somewhat predictable that something big and violent would happen at the end, but who cared? Even the ending was perfect, in my opinion.There were two things that I questioned: one was that Arthur did not use drugs or alcohol. That was certainly different, for the times and for a person with his extreme problems. The other was that the actress who plays Sophie I thought might have been too pretty and ""clean"" looking, meaning also not into drinking or drugs; her skin and eyes too clear, her weight just right, neither too thin nor too fat. It was a little difficult to buy that she would have been involved with Arthur and I was relieved when her attitude toward him changed.Joker is an awesome film and I think it will be days before I can stop thinking about it. It deserves every possible award it can get.",0

It haunts me. That character haunts me.This is definitely one of the greatest performances, if not the greatest performance by an actor in film history.",0

Joker,Insert any Buzzword Here,"I have never been a superhero fan, I like Superman as a kid and that's it. New Superman films had zero interest for me. I wasn't surprised when they all turned out badly. I didn't expect much from Batman Begins but I remember being very impressed when I watched it. However nothing compares to the feeling upon watching Joker!Wow they nailed it. Goosebumps and can't stop thinking about how perfect the film is.This is how you do a gritty realistic comic book origin story. The film is Dark, Tense, Frightening and Relevant. The plot is completely believable, it's impossible not to feel for Arthur Fleck.Film critics have been hurting the film industry for a long time with their less than honest reviews, but recently in the age of Wokeness, its gone to a whole different level. See the Tomatoes Review from critics versus the audience score for example. This is a film that actually lives up to the buzzwords.This is the best film I have seen in years by far.",0
Joker,Outstanding.,"I know the name Todd Phillips from his first feature as a student film maker, the 1993 cult documentary on extreme punk rocker, GG Allin, 'Hated: GG Allin and The Murder Junkies.

Joker,"Beautiful film, outstanding performance","**BACKSTORY**
If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would simply be ""beautiful"". From the cinematography, to the acting & improvising, to the outstanding score, Joker is by far my favorite film ever made.If you knew me before this review, you'd know that I used to always choke up when asked what my favorite film was. I could not answer, and any answer I gave was not sincere in the slightest. This one however, is.**IS IT A COMIC FILM?**
I will say this; it's not really a comic book film at all, it is *loosely* based off of the character ""Joker"", so you shouldn't go into this film expecting it to be 1:1 lore, but in my opinion that plays a key in making it so good. If this movie (in my opinion,) went with a more comic-like approach, I would not have enjoyed it as much as I do and I am certain about this. Take my advice, when you watch this movie, don't go in with the mindset that you're gonna see ""Joker"" the comic villain, go in knowing this is a film about a guy who just wants to make people laugh & smile, and is challenged by the harshness of the world he lives in. With this mindset, I can guarantee you will enjoy this film much more, just keep the DC lore to a minimal.I know what you're thinking, ""Well then, why is it called Joker?""
Like I said, it's *loosely* based off of the villain, and just a creative take on his backstory. Other than that, I don't really have any great explanations for you other than I simply enjoyed the film better by looking at it from a real world stand-point.**REVIEW**
Joaquin's portrayal of Arthur Fleck was phenomenal! He reportedly lost ~52 pounds for the part, and it really shows during the film. The performance is INCREDIBLE. His uncontrollable laugh comes to mind, as in every scene it happens you can just feel the suffering Arthur is going through, there's a particular scene that I won't go into details about, but let's just say finally catches a break, and it's all ruined from his nervous laughter. These moments really show just how great Joaquin is as portraying emotion, you can feel every bit of the character's emotions through this film. Everything from his uncontrollable laughter, to his adorable kid-like nature, everything about this character seems real and genuine like he lost himself in the part.Joker would not be what it is without the collaboration of Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips. Had Phillips not given Phoenix so much freedom, I don't believe this film would have been as successful and Todd know's this, he's acknowledged it in an interview with (I forgot who) by saying something along the lines of ""You wouldn't be a great director if you had an actor like Joaquin Phoenix on and NOT allow him such freedom."" Not word-for-word, but you get the drift.When you watch this film, pay attention the colors. The colors beautifully match the feeling of every scene, with the orange and cyan blue light's it really makes for a beautiful film, you can pretty much find a great still in every single scene that is filmed.**OVERALL**
I give this movie a 10/10 and I've never felt so sure about a rating in my life. I think it is perfect, and honestly I do *not* want a sequel, this film is perfect as a one-off and I HIGHLY recommend you see it in theatre's before it is too late, this is not a film you want to miss the experience of seeing on the big screen.",0

I was actually blown away by this work of art .This movie was beautifully recorded, acted, and scripted from the opening scene to the ending credits .this movie gave us a new version of the joker that we've never seen before .. it gave the character the backstory he deserved .. and DC gave us the Joker solo movie we deserve... it's an origins story that will make you sympathize with joker,feel pity for him,laugh with him,like him, and of course fear him. This masterpiece was almost 2 hours long packed with a load of emotions .....I cant remember a single minute where i wasn't on the edge of my seat following every movement,every scene and every detail in this performance... and what a performance it was !!!!
Joaquin Phoenix nailed this role to no end, he was brilliant ! when the casting was revealed and we knew that Phoenix was getting the role I thought ""yeah this guy could deliver "" but I never expected this level of awesomeness and genius!
This film is a must see it will be remembered for a very long time ,I think it's by far the movie of the year and i guess both Phoenix and Todd Phillips deserve an academy award for this magnificent masterpiece !!",0

Joker,"What he did was wrong, but was it the right thing to do at the moment ?","The creative liberty given to the director/writers has given a new blend on the way you look at the joker. You don't need to be a fan of DC and/or the joker to engulf in to this epic saga of the journey of a transformation of a character. Every moment you have sympathy with the protagonist, he outsmarts you and surprises with the next move. The cringe it creates what happens next and results in another fiasco.All the time you ask yourself what he did was wrong, but was it the right thing to do at the moment ?
The so cleverly written movie was very well crafted and Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the respect on impersonating the soul of the character, Todd Phillip from his history of making movies has totally changed, He has become joined the big boys league now.
It would be a sin here not to mention clockwork orange and how someone is forcefully made into something, although joker here was more forced by the society.
And finally, Heath Ledger, the joker from the dark Knight, this was how a psychotic mind like him will become after few years past. Saying which one was better is a bad comparison to make. But with all respects to heath ledger, Joaquin Phoenix faced the gradient of character, which gives him the lead.",0

Joker,Heath ledger must be smiling from heaven,"Wowww, wowwww , wowwww the hype is real ,One of the best movies i have watched in years. when DC first announced that they are making a new joker movie , I couldn't imagine someone else portraying the joker role rather than Heath , but now after watching the movie , i must say that Joaquin was good as Heath , he was epic , his voice , dance moves , and his lough , omg how did he lough like this , he made it feel so real , you could feel pain and emotions through this lough , just wow , it is an oscar performance.
Now lets talk about the movie , where can i start , first , it is the movie of the year for sure, the score , script , cinematography and ofcourse the acting was perfect , you could clearly see an amazing and well written character development .

Joker,Phoenix does it again..,"I was initially sold on on its very first trailer, where I instantly realised that Phoenix's portrayal of Joker's humble beginnings would be another exemplary performance to add to his already prestigious filmography.
Now after seeing the movie in full, my assumptions are confirmed.This was a perfect example of how villains are made. How a history of abuse, trauma and neglect has resulted in a mental illness that has left our protagonist to function as a lonely awkward outsider on the fringes of society.
Most people in such a state are but a shadow of themselves, yet for men like Arthur, having hit rock bottom and awakening to the conclusion of having nothing left to lose, they set themselves free, allowing their alter ego to come out and play. And there's nothing quite as dangerous as a sharp and calculating man who has a few screws loose; loose enough to twist that moral code that most of us keep firmly intact.Although pure perfection, for me, would have it ending 5mins earlier, as he stood on the bonnet of that cop car, amidst the rioting, practically praised as the prince of anarchy. Had the credits rolled right then, in my mind, figuratively speaking, I would have stood up and given an applause consisting of five full-blown claps (that's three claps more than I'm accustomed to giving).I'm happy that this was the movie that the wife and I chose as our date-night outing. Last time we went to the cinema together was 7 months ago and were pretty disappointed with what we watched. But not this time. This time, we praised it all the way back home.",0

Joker,Bucket list viewing.,"I'd been resisting seeing this film for weeks watching others and admittedly not really enjoying any of them. Finally there was nothing else of interest to watch so off we went.
The opening scene of laughter triggered a painfully visceral sense of discomfort. Like being hit with a 2X4 I was awake and focused. Like many others I did not expect this and I did not expect this from Todd Phillips so my bad on both counts. Powerful, moving and brilliant in many respects this seemed like a curtain going up to reveal a whole new form of film making. I couldn't help think of Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot"" and how it could be re-imagined so that today's audiences would flock to it. Using veils such as ""the Joker"" might just be the vehicle to make it work.
I'm also bemused at peoples comparisons to Heath Ledgers Joker. While the connection seems obvious, I'd suggest Ledger and Phoenix's joker should be judged independently as standalone works of creative brilliance.
Strangely I'm suddenly not interested in watching other comic book stories after seeing the Joker be they DC or Marvel.
If you like myself had/have any preconceived ideas, set them aside and see The Joker.",0

Joker,A very deeping movie.,"Joker"" is a 2019 film directed by Todd Phillips.
It is nothing but a message in favor of suffering people, forgotten and marginalized by the rest of society.
Today many people are just a mass of suppressants, selfish, cruel and exploiters towards the weakest needy. The reason why an individual behaves in a certain way does not matter. Only what others have seen count, I learned from third parties without making sure or investigating why he did it.
I hope the world changes.
May everyone realize that we are human beings who tend to do good but unfortunately we should move away from suppressors or those who represent antisocials. I hope everyone can realize how much we can do our best for ourselves and for the welfare of others.

Joker,Let's dive deep!,"I heard a lot of people complaining about the fact that this Joker got nothing to do with Batman's Joker that we all know and love. Well, you're missing many points here!1-This movie is supposed to be a non-canon one, meaning it's more of else world story than it's a continuity.
2-The movie is made to tell the story of how society can drive a man into madness and they nailed it.
3-Up till this very moment, The Joker never had an origin story. In the comics you gonna have the vet accident, the failing comedian, the three jokers, the lazuras pit joker, etc. So why all the madness about a story that suggest a different background and taking a page from the comics as well while they do it resulting in the most believable and humane story ever!
4-The acting was great, the movie was meh! Seriously guys you're missing it all over again, if you think the acting is solid then the movie is solid cause this is a one man show, it tells the story from Arthur's perspective.Pay a good second watch to the movie and enjoy a masterpiece that we'll have to wait a while till we learn how to praise it.",0
Joker,Horribly awesome,"For me I call tell, this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life in term of acting, sound effects, story,..... despite of having very dark depressing moments in this movie, you still sense the feeling of greatness after finish watching the movie.
First time ever to watch a realistic comic movie which made him a one of a kind.
The problem is this movie might encourage some evil things in our real world to whose see themselves in this movie in a way or another, the fact that the moments and situations you experienced in the joker might happened to you through your life, how many times you got a depressing situations where someone enjoys making fun of you or mocking your life, character, origin, religion, skin color. Ideology or even just bullying you in school. Let's think about that.

Joker,More than expected,Buzz created by joker before the release is extraordinary. From trailer it's obvious that Joaquin phoenix did a Oscar worthy performance.

Joker,Worthy of all the praise it can get,"What is there to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Joker is a meticulous, expertly crafted piece of art, in terms of writing, direction, cinematography, and especially performance. Every element of this film is a solid piece of the framework and each lends their strengths to each other in a way that hasn't been seen in a comic book movie before.From Pheonix's heart-wrenching, mesmerizing, and terrifying performance, to the tension building, tragic score, to the harsh depth of field that leaves the viewer in a dream-land, as if everything in the world is an illusion. There isn't a single element of Joker that isn't filled with passion and careful consideration. A week after seeing it and I've done nothing but think about each element more and more - it's a story that begs for repeat viewings, filled to the brim with detail, leaving space for theorizing and conspiring, the perfect way to do a Joker origin movie:""If I'm going to have a past, I'd rather it be multiple choice""The only slight downfalls of this near masterpiece is that in some parts it can feel a little repetitive, and it does heavily borrow from Scorcese films such as Taxi Driver & King of Comedy, but ultimately these are minor nitpicks in an unforgettable, unsettling, and thought-provoking narrative that will continue to be discussed and theorised for years.Filled with quotables, memorable moments, shocking moments, shocking moments with hints of Joker comedy, this is definitely the perfect Joker origin story, as well as an important message/warning to society regarding the 1%.",0
Joker,One of the best character breakdown,"The character grows beautifully and the acting skills were perfection, I know you probably seen some reviews criticising the violence but this movie shows that when you don't recognise mental health problems and on top you get bullied on a daily basis then it can only lead to two things.. one you end up dead through suicide or you become suicidal and others end up dead.

Joker,Cinematic Genius,"It's been 12 hours since I saw Joker at my local cinema and my head is still spinning.
I didn't get much sleep and I'm still trying to process what happened.
It was nothing short of a feast for the senses and I just wanted more.Make no mistake - this is cinematic brilliance at its highest level.
A masterpiece.
Hauntingly beautiful, magnificent, mesmerizing.
Stunning.
Chilling.
I honestly don't think I blinked during the two hours in fear of missing something.The onscreen world immediately captures you and pulls you in to an 80's Gotham City.
The thunderous Dolby Atmos soundtrack is beautiful, chilling and at times downright terrifying.If you are expecting a non-stop gore fest then you will be bitterly disappointed.
There are a handful of shootings.
What you will experience is a classic film of unprecedented genius, both artistically and technically.I must admit I went into the theatre with a bias towards Joaquin Phoenix.
Everyone has read the stories of his whacky antics and frequent meltdowns.
I'd seen his on set rant on talk show Jimmy Kimmel a few weeks back and thought him to be just another pretentious actor.
All is forgiven.
His performance in this film is truly breathtaking.Joker is not just another DC superhero film, it's a journey into the mind of a twisted psychopath who needed help but didn't get it.
For some reason, actors who have previously played this character (Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, Romero, etc.) have all turned in both sterling and mesmerizing performances.
But it's Phoenix who now wears the crown as The Clown Prince Of Crime.Here is my rather modest prediction come Oscar season.Best picture.
Best screenplay.
Best director.
Best cinematography.
Best actor in a leading role.
Best musical score.
Best sound editing.What I'm trying to say is this is undoubtably the best piece of modern cinema I have ever seen.P.S. For those uneasy about Gary Glitter coining in the royalties for his track in the film, his catalogue was bought out years ago by a UK based publishing company so he will not be receiving a dime for the tracks inclusion.",0

Fact of the matter, we witnessed a little more than we signed up for. Joaquin phoenix delivered a new standard for acting, embracing a complex dramatic ascension of the Joker character throughout the movie, shedding focus on the horrendous truth of the society we live in.

Joaquin Phoenix found his destiny in this role.After watching this movie I saw an imaginary line in the end credits ""This movie is dedicated to all the lost and tortured souls out there"".

Joker,Joker is a victim of an uncaring society,"This movie is a story of mentally ill person being pushed out of society, abused by people around him and broken by people he idolize.
This isn't a some fictional story filled with CGI, and to some this isn't even a fictional story. There are lots of people who are treated just like Joker. They suffer in silence, their existence is treated as nuisance, their calls for help are called ""toxic"" or ""privileged"". Society so happily mistreat people, but then act in shock and horror when those people break.
Joker is a movie about pain and irony of the world. It shows how society treat those who are different and how it repays those who have dreams. This movie forces abusers to see the life of their victims, it shows the consequences of careless evil. That is why abusers and generally evil people can't stand this movie - because it shows them who the true villain is. Joker isn't the villain of this movie. He does lots of horrid things, the character should rot in jail for his actions, but shouldn't the people who made him suffer the same fate? Joker is a product of torture, so he lashes out against his torturers. Nothing more.By the way, it also have great comedic moments, but as Joker says himself: ""Humor is subjective"".",0

This is the story of one man's journey into darkness and that is why Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is easily the best Joker that has ever graced the big screen in my opinion.Will Phoenix win the oscar? Probably not. I can't see that spineless (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) politically correct tool of an organization giving out any major awards to a film this good.Joker is the best movie I've watched in the past 10 years.

Joker,A very uplifting movie !,"This movie was a bit different from what I had expected yo see, in that, for a movie about a joker there are very few jokes, and very little humor. It is still very worth seeing, though. It does address the very real and pressing issue of income inequality, and the feelings of isolation and futility that many people feel today. These are really the most moving scenes of the movie, and the ones that really cast Arthur in the role of the every man we can all relate to. The way that he becomes an icon to all of his ""clown"" admirers, especially toward the end of the movie, was the most uplifting part of the movie. The fact that there is a scene that is very similair to the one shown in the original 1989 Batman film makes this film both a Batman and Joker origin story.

Joker,Put on a happy face!,"You won't actually be putting on a happy face while watching Joker, what you'll be doing instead is witness the greatest film of the year and the Oscar-worthy performance of Joaquin Phoenix. His performance is extraordinary, every single time you hear him laugh, you know something is wrong and you start to feel uncomfortable, add all that to his facial expressions and acting skills and you've got yourself a perfect performance that will be talked about for years to come. What this movie does to its viewers is fantastic, you're on the edge of your seat through all of its runtime which is about 2 hours. Joker is full of shocking scenes and so many surprises and it utilizes its R-rating very well. As we know this movie talks about mental illness and what it does to people and how it affects them specially when those people get abused or be made fun of, and Joker portrays this so perfectly that you even tend to sympathize with the main character, not that he is a good guy, he's not, he's the Joker after all, but by the way of how they portrayed this, you will be able to relate to this character and understand what he's going through so that by the time his story comes full circle and you see his character evolve to the clown prince of crime we all love to hate and hate to love, you'll be very satisfied and upset at the same time by how he becomes the Joker and it's all in a good way. Joker has quite the Easter eggs and references to other movies like the King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as the director Todd Phillips said that those two movies inspired him to do Joker, so you'll definitely feel some elements of those movies in here too. Talking about this movie without spoiling it is so difficult, but all i'll say is this: Joker is a drama masterpiece and it's not like any other comic book movie that's been made before, this is an original story that is based on the character ""Joker"" from DC comics but with a new and a deep origin story that is basically a character study that'll leave you wondering and thinking about how devastating it is by the time the credits start rolling.Verdict: Joker is one of those movies that after viewing, you will need to sit down and try to take it all in because it dives deep into what mental illness is and how it can affect people and how society can be a part of that transformation.",0

Joker,What A Performance,"I was skeptical at first about this movie when I first heard that they were going to be producing a solo Joker film. But after viewing the trailer numerous times, I realized this could be one of those hit or miss films. This film for me was a hit, everything from the acting to the cinematography. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and is a fine representation of why the film industry in America is known as the best. Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job as the joker. Truly a gut wrenching performance, which could be argued by many as a Oscar worthy performance. Truly this film is one of the greatest films produced in 2019.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Surprisingly Excellent...HONESTLY,"Joker Review, No spoilers
My rating for Joker: 9.5 !
LOVED the movie!!! Had me thinking the whole time. Had its aha moments, moments of sadness and laughter. I am almost positive that we ALL laughed out loud at the same scenes...especially that one scene in the apartment near the end of the movie. Bringing up the 2 father figures and an ill mother really helped develop Arthur along with the tragedies that happened in his life.
His condition was believable based off of his excellent performance and animated laugh. Loved that Zazie Beetz was in this movie. Adored her character. Appreciated how a Joker movie was not all about Batman or Bruce Wayne. I couldn't have done the ending any better because the implication was perfect and they didn't have to spell it out for us. I'm convinced that Todd Phillips, the main producer, is an absolute genius. After watching this emotional rollercoaster, this movie deserves AT LEAST an Golden Globe nomination, if not a victory.
My only criticism is on some of the camera shots, although I understand how hard it is to make sure the main subject of the shots are always in the limelight. For instance, the train and bank scene . Also, depending on what kind of a movie watcher you are, you may not enjoy the layout of the music. For me, it was enjoyable.Do you think this joker movie will tie into Robert Pattinson's Batman movie?",0

Joker,A work of art,"I rarely give a perfect note but this movie deserves 100%. An origin story like you have never seen before. It seems so real that it could easily happen in the real world.
It points a finger to real life problems like desinstitutinalisation and the lack of help and follow up for people who suffer from psychiatric problems.
Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible. He is not playing the Joker... he IS the Joker. His performance deserves an Academy Award. He is a method actor who transforms his body and his soul for his roles.
The cinematography (Lawrence Sher) is breathtaking. He is able to create a very heavy and dark ambiance that keeps us hooked. It's visually stunning. As the transformation of Arthur into the Joker advances, the camera makes the character seem bigger and just with that we can feel the confidence that he develops.
Todd Phillips has written, produced and directed was is, in my opinion, a work of art. The movie is heavy and difficult to watch at times. There are some very graphic and violent scenes but they are all necessary to the character development. I very rarely feel a deep internal unease as I watch a movie but I did as I watched how sad and tragic Arthur's life was.
The fact that they are able to make the watchers feel compassion for a psychopath is not an easy task.
The character development makes sense for once.
This is not a comic book movie. It's a character study.
Wow.",0
Joker,Don't Smile,"In a time where super hero movies dominate the circuit, it is so refreshing to get to see the other side i.e. the ""villains"" perspective. This was done so beautifully that i actually felt sorry for the Joker. Jared Leto's performance for me was horrible. JP has really come to the fore, i even got chills, from when he laughed profusely to his whole body structure. Really impressed with this movie and the story line. A must watch.

Joker,Send in the clowns.,"One of the best aspects about DC's iconic Clown Prince of Crime, The Joker, is the ambiguity of his origins. Alan Moore's phenomenal graphic novel The Killing Joke (1988) provides us with one of the many possible origins for the character, but even Moore's renowned interpretation isn't considered to be the definitive backstory. Making his debut in Batman #1 in 1940, The Joker remains one of the most recognisable villains in the history of comics. Each appearance of The Joker, from The Dark Knight Returns (1986) to The Killing Joke, to Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on a Series Earth (1989) to Batman R.I.P (2008), and many, many more, stands as a uniquely different portrayal of the character, while still maintaining the core essence of his psychotic persona. Todd Philips' stand-alone origin story Joker is no exception. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a party clown pursuing a career (unsuccessfully) as a stand up comedian in Gotham City. He lives in a rundown apartment with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and suffers from a condition which causes him to laugh uncontrollably in inappropriate situations. Disregarded by society, Arthur slowly spirals into a life of crime, paving the way for the creation of his maniacal alter-ego, Joker.When it was announced Warner Bros. Pictures were developing a stand-alone Joker film, I was one of the many sceptics who claimed (with absolute confidence) that such an idea was unnecessary. Heath Ledger delivered an outstanding performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), and his portrayal has been long regarded as the highwater mark for those daring enough to adopt the role. Jared Leto's odd, over-the-top portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime wasn't embraced by neither fans nor critics in 2016's terrible Suicide Squad, which led many to believe the Joker role had become untouchable since Ledger's critically acclaimed portrayal. However, in Joker, Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the titular character. Phoenix embodies the role perfectly; his performance doesn't mimic Ledgers (and rightfully steers clear of all Leto's shortcomings), and instead crafts a whole new take on the character while still maintaining the core essence of what makes The Joker so renowned. Phoenix brings a damaged realness to the role and embraces the sinister undercurrents of Fleck's mentally disturbed psyche. At times, he's downright unnerving. On occasion, I was reminded of Matt Dillon's performance as Jack in Lars von Trier's serial killer epic The House That Jack Built (2018). Both Arthur and Jack are mentally disturbed loners who harbour sinister urges, but what distinguishes Arthur Fleck from Trier's Jack (who, by all accounts, is a killer who isn't fumbling for validation in his crimes) is how he finds justification for enacting his own immoral sense of justice onto a society that has wrongfully disregarded him. It is important to note that you aren't coerced into rooting for Arthur as he descends further into madness. By no means is Joker portrayed as an antihero; you sympathise with him when the film begins, but this sympathy is short-lived once Fleck ultimately falls victim to his own heinous choices. From his maniacal laugh to his off-kilter, deranged mannerisms, Phoenix delivers a masterclass performance that would certainly make Ledger proud.Make no mistake, Joker is not what you've come to expect from the modern day comic book film. Philips and Silver have crafted a script that is grounded in reality and, at its core, it is a focused, psychological character study that trades in CGI spectacle (something that largely dominates comic book blockbusters these days) for mean-spirited, gritty nihilism. It's brilliantly constructed and certainly benefits from repeat viewings, as there is much of the film that is left open to interpretation. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir provides the film with a terrific score; it's brooding and eerily atmospheric, and stands as one of the best film scores of recent memory. It is a film dripping with atmosphere and tension that gradually elevates towards a finale that embraces the anarchy that Joker is known for. Joker has certainly garnered its fair share of controversy on the road towards its highly anticipated release, largely due to its violence and perceived influence it may inflict on audiences. While the film certainly has its violent moments, the violence never once overshadows the central narrative, nor is it as violent as the detractors would have you believe. What Joker ultimately serves as is a cautionary tale, while shining a light on how corruption can manifest within society.Joker is everything one could want from a Joker origin story. Dark, tense and fiercely gripping, it stands as one of the all time great Joker stories with a career best performance from Phoenix at the heart of it all. Destined to become a celebrated classic, Joker is this years must see film.",0

Joker,That's Life- Fits in like a glove,"Joker is not a movie of pretense. It is about the truth.I think most people who disliked this movie disliked it because they were expecting some fairy tale, like they always do. But that's not the reality, is it? It hardly ever is. This movie portrays how much society can break you from within. This movie shows the struggle of a common man. It doesn't need any universe to follow, because it is a masterpiece on it's own.I went in to see a movie about this DC villain, but what did I get? I got exposed to the truth. It was certainly clever how the writers mixed a fictional character with someone who's living in this world and gave us something we kept thinking about hours after we came back from the theater.And Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Joker was as moving as the script. It was dark, it was bone-chilling and most importantly, it was brave. To portray a character like that, it takes guts. And he did justice.In all, it was worth it. Making this film was worth it. Received by many as a cold-hearted comedy, well you have it. That's life.",0

Joker,Best Joker's body language thus far.,"Uniqueness of this production, when compared with Batman comic books, games and other movies, is undeniable. Joker's identity and his plans are very much the opposite of a mystery in here. This shift in perspective may just be what ""Joker"" needed to be the best movie based on a character from DC.For some reason, Joker is always taken very seriously by actors playing his role. Jack Nicolson's and Heath Ledger's Jokers were definitely phenomenal yet mostly acted by voice and facial expressions. It's fair to say that Joaquin Phoenix raised the bar by an order of magnitude. In his version of the Joker, voice acting and facial expressions are just minor parts of a bigger picture. His Joker moves like Joker. His Joker laughs and dances like Joker. It's very apparent how his Joker thinks, and he thinks like the Joker. He just feels like him. The level of immersion is unprecedented.Artistically, ""Joker"" is just beautiful. Music is perfect, Gotham feels enchanting but depressing, character costumes are very appealing. Whole experience is hypnotic, almost like in a comic book.Besides a true Joker and good Gotham, the movie contains some less important themes which aren't bad but may be distracting. It felt like they put two rather irrelevant scenes featuring young Bruce Wayne just for the sake of using the franchise. I also think that yet another version of Batman origins scene is the last thing a DC fan would like to see. All easily forgivable as everyone leaves their yaw on cinema floor anyway.",0

Joker,Absolute Masterpiece.,One of the few movies that comes around that you will remember forever. An absolute masterclass. Phoenix has brought to life some brilliant characters and I've been a fan but the way he built and portrayed this character is on another level. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the all time great method actors and deserved triple Oscar winner but Phoenix for me takes this crown. Two of the best hours ever. If he does not get an Oscar for this film (and Todd Phillips for Directing) - how can the Oscars ever be considered credible.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0

Joker,A Masterpiece which would have worked as great even if it had not relation with the BATMAN Universe,"JOKER is a psychological study of the character, Not your regular comic book Movie. The movie forces audience to think deeply about issues regarding morality, mental health, bullying, the rich and the society as a whole. The main focus of the movie is the mind of Arthur and how it fragments apart under the many inhumane but impactful acts of the society which when pile up brings out the Joker in Arthur. What makes this hit the core of masses, is its relatability. He's a relatable kind of villain, bullied and sad. It also depicts how mental health issues are ignored by the corporates and the suffering people become even more isolated. Joaquin Phoenix has done a phenomenal job, even just looking at his laugh in which he has masterfully depicted the hidden sorrow behind the character, makes you realize that the man has worked hours and hours just to make this perfect. Cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack suited the storyline perfectly. Even if the movie had no relation to the Batman universe at all, it would still have worked just as great. In the end, although you can't justify the acts of Arthur, but you definitely understand them.",0

Joker,"Believe the hype, disregard bad reviews","The controversy surrounding this film definitely lured me into the theater last night to watch it. I have to say it is a dark and gritty movie.

I live outside of Annapolis, MD where a mass shooting took place not even 2 years ago and this movie is relevant to our social climate now more than ever.

Joker,Wow. Just wow.,"I am beyond words. This movie is phenomenal. It is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix definitely is my favorite live action Joker. Yes more than Heath and Jack (although i really HATE comparing them). This is not your typical comic book movie. It is a character study about a man who becomes the Joker. About what it took to drive him this far. The film is dark, disturbing and masterful work of art. Its one of the most beautiful movie i've ever seen. This movie deserves an Oscar. Not just beat actor, but best score, best cinema photography, best film and of course, best director, which definitely goes to the man Todd Philips. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an oscar i'll riot. Believe the hype and screw the haters. Its truly beautiful. But dont just take my word for it, take all of the other 100's of positive reviews that say the same thing. I seriously wish there was a higher number than 10. This is like a 101/10. Just check it out. You won't regret it.

Joker,Finally someone's on par with Heath Ledger,"Heath Ledger's Joker was total chaos. Very smart, spontaneous and stupendously brave.
But Joaquin Phoenix's joker is a man oppressed by the heartless, careless society and broken financial system. He's born in poverty that has deprived him of his social rights.
Joaquin Phoenix has out done himself and justified the extremely high acting bar set by Heath Ledger.

Joker,"Sometimes i remember it one way, sometimes i remember it another.","The Joker has many origin stories, in comics, in movies or even series.
What this movie essentially does, is amplifies the best qualities that Joker offers.
It is a raw, sickening, intriguing and unsettling movie that understands what Joker is supposed to be, unpredictable, chaotic, the ebb which flows.I have so many good things to say, and literally no negativity towards this movie.
Amazing visuals, spectacular actor who portrays Joker, good music, stylish and memorable scenes.As a fan, this is everything i ever wanted. If this is your first Joker movie,
expect to be shocked, repulsed, disgusted, intrigued.
This is what Joker is, this is what joker has always been and should always be.A solid 10/10, i can't believe we live in a world where movies from DC can be this good.",0

Joker,"Big Holes That Society Has, And Are Covered","I can resiliently say that Joker is a movie the world needed. Most critics get carried away by political, personal and sometimes illicit influences as they review it. In this way it presents a disturbed view of masterful works. Joker touches delicate subjects in a way that is rarely seen in today's theaters. If the world can't handle a profound work like, then it means the world needs to change. And change the way we view complex social issues, which we prefer to isolate it from debate because of the high diversity of opinion. Very well built and set, Joker brings big holes that society has, and are covered.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Speechless.. Stunned !!,"My review is incomplete as there is so much to discuss but i am speechless.. This is by far one of the most ""well done"" movie based on the life of a mentally ill person. You are very much instilled in the shoe of a person who has mental illness and has to face the modern day society who expect him to behave.. as if he doesn't !! For me this move is 1 step beyond another master piece called ""Memento (2000)"" which was also based on a mentally ill character. But Joker is an extensively Dark movie for a main-stream Cinema specially when he is dancing he is sending a layered message to the audience. Most of the times this movie gives you the feel of an Art Movie (more than just an action flick or superhero flick). The dark and disturbing part of this movie is sheer work of Art that too performed with utter brilliance. And last but not least, Phoenix is by far the best and most Realistic Joker ever.. for me he did a PERFECT job of not only Joker but also a mentally ill person.. Perfect expression, laughter and dialogue delivery .. In the End Please NOTE: that when i said 'mentally ill' i meant a person Not Fit for modern day hypocrite Society : )",0

Joker,-A dark masterpiece-,"Don't go into this movie thinking that it's going to carry the same tone as the dark knight.

Joker,All I have are positive thougts,"One more masterpiece for the DC movies. Joaquin Phoenix deserves for sure his oscar and Todd Philips did an amazing job not only as a director but also as a writer. I fully recommend this movie to all the fans of the dark knight and to those who love character development and interesting dialogues and quotes and generally movies that keep you thinking hard for weeks. So it is important to remember that this Joker is a different version of the character and so you should not hope for another 2008-Joker. Moreover, it is not a Nolan movie and so its main theme and focus are different from the Dark Knight since Joker is a drama-thriller movie. And this is the reason why it is such an unique film-masterpiece. Finally, it is one of the most interesting movies I have ever watched.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,It's so much more than a character study.,"There is a danger to this film.An origin story, sure. But a warning about how society, friends and family can slowly wear away at a person - and how there's no time taken by anyone to understand anyone who is struggling, is different, who's 'failing'.Like driving and parenting, those who are poor at these things, seldom realise just how bad they are. With social responsibility and awareness, people are just the same. Everyone thinks they're good. Posted that suicide awareness meme? Tick. I'm a solid human being. Then post a video of that weirdo on the bus.The film has divided many. I suspect that those who've not enjoyed it are those with little empathy or those lucky enough not to have an ignored struggle to cope with. Certainly not adrift from society, or failing to 'achieve' (urgh). It's quite likely the film's closing line was a predictor of those reactions. I was the only one laughing at this and a few other moments.Phoenix cuts through his character's psyche here more than Joker does any victim. He breathes and cries loneliness. There are several moments which openly show his struggle to join in with a world he doesn't fit into. He waltzes through these and more, pulling you on-side and deeper and deeper. And I felt it. Very much.And that's where it could be dangerous. A potential call to arms.But above all, it's a remarkably engrossing piece, linking as much with King Of Comedy as with the Batman story. Drawing the links between the two worlds into focus too, and forcing us to question our ignorance and to challenge known truths.Phoenix will win Best Actor for this. Rightly so.",0

Joker,"Incredible dark gritty movie, forget rich powerful superheros, this is the time of the underdog.","After falling out of love with the Marvel & DC universes and now pretty much giving up on all super hero movies altogether, I was apathetic when the ads for Joker first appeared in my local cinema. I looked at my 16 year old son, who loves watching movies too, and we both shared the same thought: ""yeah whatever""....But as the trailer rolled, it started to look interesting. Then I checked facebook, and friends who had seen the trailer too were talking excitedly. Someone said ""in Marvel they take a human and give him superpowers, here we have the opposite, a man who has everything taken away from him"" and that really resonated with me.This is one of the most important movies of our time, starring one of the most important actors of our time, the incredible Joaquin Phoenix, who has blazed a trail of cinematic excellence for many years and who's career, I think, culminates to huge climax here in this film.It's dark, dark, dark. So damn gritty and real the camera work gives us this filthy downtrodden vision of Gotham and city on the brink of self destruction. No one flys or has a special suit there are no superpowers, or laser beams, there is just a man being spat out by the system, which is run by the rich for the rich and is becoming increasingly greedy and selfish. Included in this system is the Wayne family, who despite whatever their intentions actually are, are presented here as little more than white over privileged rich people who live in a huge gated house with private security. Yeah whatever Bruce but did you ever really spend time in the ghetto?This is the commentary and Joker is trying, he's really trying to absorb the hate and the crap and the downright hardship that life is throwing at him, but he lacks the presence of mind to do it quite literally, struggles with an insane urge to laugh all the time even when things are absolutely not funny and of course the rest is history.I hope this doesn't spoil it for you, go and watch it, that's 2 hours of your life you will want to repeat.",0

Joker,Perhaps the most human villain I've ever seen,"If watching this film was a game of chess, you'd be playing against an opponent who won the game before it even started.

Other directors should take notes because this is character study drama at its finest.While some will say it moved too slowly, I personally feel it was paced perfectly given the content; a slow-bleeding, 'death by a thousand cuts' delivery, which gradually ramps up over the course of the entire film. The juxtaposition of humor and despair had my emotions on a tilt-a-whirl throughout, and was accompanied by a soundtrack that complemented the themes very well.I highly recommend watching this one at least once, but steel yourself because it packs quite a punch.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,An experience one must have!!,"Let me just say that no, the praise everyone has heard about this before it released was not the usual overhyping of a movie from critics at festivals, it was 100% deserved, I completely understand why it got an 8 minute standing ovation at Venice and yes, I did clap when this movie ended, and so did the packed audience at the theatre I went to.I mean, can you blame me? From the minute ""Joker"" starts you are glued to the screen, I literally did not avert my gaze for a second. Joaquin Phoenix gives probably the best performance of his life (and that's saying something) and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.The story, even though a tad predictable, is amazingly written, full of great moments, both funny and dramatic and really shows
us why Arthur Fleck decides to turn into the homicidal maniac that is the Joker.Overall this is probably my favourite comic-book movie of all time, if not just my favourite movie of all time, the way Todd Philips directed his feature is astonishing, I mean this movie looks sooooo good and I, for one, cannot wait to see what he does in the future.A+",0

The cinematography is purely superb and finally I have seen a new colour palette that wasn't repeated a thousand times. There were so many potentially iconic scenes that will become memes and film history, that on its own makes this movie worthy of appraisal. I'd love to see how Joaquin Phoenix went inside the head of the Joker, because he definitely studied symptoms of insanity in depth. So many great things been already said about this film, I won't repeat those. The last 20 minutes of the film is freaking intense and when the Joker finally let all his will to pretend to be sane go, you will witness an unparalleled transformation that's not going to be forgotten or topped by anyone in our lifetime. There were so many moments in Fleck's life when he could have been helped or stopped, but society just didn't care for him. Hunted, bullied, despised, ridiculed and ultimately lied to by everyone including his closest relatives...no wonder he became the Joker. I am so happy this movie could happen in this time and age of ultra sensitivity and its reception is so overwhelming. In the diarrhoea of degenerate Disney flicks here we have a movie that will make people think and talk about it for hours on end. And finally f..k the Oscar for Best Movie, this movie already won the most significant award in Venice where real cinematic art is awarded not the best money making scheme. Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for Best Actor of 2019. Nothing I have seen this year touches his performance...not a thing! Oh, the soundtrack. How could I not mention the heart wrenching score by the Icelandic cello artist and composer Hildur Gudnadottir?! Anyone remembers the subway scene and then the following impromptu dance in the toilet with that amazing score in the background? That's called perfection!üëçüèª",0

Great performance from phenix to joker character development from a regular mentally unstable person to the most famous criminal in the world which is completely different story from what ledger gave us as you can consider joker movie is the answer of the question: how could any human be the joker ?
And the very first moment of this human as the joker then you watch ledger present the joker in his prime after mastering criminal methods and have his followers
Joker along side batman begins and the dark knight gave us a great saga and if DC want more glory thy can make one or two more movie to complete what could happen in the future of the dark knight between batman and joker to make historical saga can compete with infinity saga and Star Wars2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

He was the perfect actor for this role and without him the movie would not be the same. The story is very good and well-written, and a lot of people seem to agree with me. Everyone should definitely take the chance to go watch it while it's still in theaters. Don't listen to the bad reviews, most of them expected this movie to just be another superhero vs villain movie where the Joker is just a boring old villain with a clown's face. No, this is not one of those films. This is a much darker, more original villain movie that focuses on the problems in our society.

Joker,"I've seen sociopathy up close, this is the real deal!","This movie made me create an account to review it.
I've watched it twice in the cinema in 12 hours.
Here's the thing, I studied sociopathy for a few months after seeing it up close in a close person. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just deliver what may be the best performance an actor ever gifted the world (perhaps tied with Branston Cranston's Walter White in Breaking Bad).
But he behaves exactly like a sociopath does, with an origin story that perfectly maps that of many sociopaths - which I won't spoil you with.
He should get one Oscar for best actor, and one for accuracy and realism.
This is not just a movie, it a scientific achievement and it will be used by psychologists and psychiatrists for Aeons to come.
This movie is currently rated 9.2 despite Marvel fans voting it 1 star just to make Endgame higher.
Do the math and you'll see, that means that Joker is right now the highest rated movie in history. Anyone who criticizes Joaquin's perfomance is simply a fortunate person, who never actually met a sociopath and can't understand what they're seeing.
This movie will still be remembered a century from now.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

But joker in the second half is a person who shows that innocence and sacrifice do not actually mean anything to people. people's approach to us affects us. arthur has also transform Joker in a corrupt system.

Joker,In your face call for justice that upsets the corrupt elite,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypo crites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.",0
Joker,Wow!,"Can't even believe the basic and stupid bad critics to this masterpiece. You know nothing about acting, directing and post production work if you don't like this movie. From the beginning to the end it's a delicious journey into this perturbed mind and how every act is introduced is incredible surprising. I think the people don't like it is because they were looking for big explosions, stupid CGI and poor acting as they are used to in MCU movies.

In fact, it matches the tone def blame Gotham has in the movie for the first act, anger at a vigilante clown, and not the state of society and lack of social services that got them there. Excellent cast, wonderful performance, and shame on all the people who vilified it for personal gain. While it might not be for everyone, especially those not interested in delving into the origins of a mad killer character, there are even more gruesome origin stories out there, this one doesn't deserve all this solo negative attention.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Phoenix and Phillips craft a masterpiece,"This is the greatest depiction of a comic book charachter in a movie of all time. Phoenix inhabits this man outcast by society and destined to be the greatest villain Gotham has ever known, and puts his all into it. His performance of a man who's been persecuted his whole life for his mental conditions was immaculate. He brings this charachter to life like no one ever has (Ledger included). Another aspect that can't be swept under the rug is how Impressive of a directing job Phillips did. The fact that he is able to move from directing some of the most renound comedies of all time, to crafting this intense character piece is a credit to his unbelievable skill. The Joker has always been depicted as existing in a world outside of ours, but in this dark drama it's accuratley shown what it would be like if this villain actually existed in the real world. An aspect of this film that's likely not going to get as much attention as it should from general audiences is the score. It's brilliant, and elevates this movie to a whole other level. Don't even hesitate if thinking about watching this movie, do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this expertly conceived world.",0

The last bits that crumbled Jokers hopes in society was shattering for me to.

Joker,Best movie EVER,"This movie has everything that your heart desires. Great background score, great camera angle and an amazing storyline. I can't find words to describe the performance by Joaquin Phoenix so I won't even try but that man has set the standards SO high that even he won't be able to cross them.

Joker,"A character study of a broken man who finally decides to embrace his insanity, that just so happens to be based on a popular comic book character.","'Joker' is not a comic book movie about the origin of a supervillain. Instead, it is a character study of a broken man who finally decides to embrace his insanity, that just so happens to be produced by a recognisable brand. And oh man, how I wish more mainstream films were like this.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a career-defining powerhouse performance as the lead that also arguably redefines the Joker. Whereas the character has previously been portrayed as a criminal mastermind that poses an unstoppable foil to Batman, or in Jared Leto's case, just a joke, Phoenix achieves something I previously thought unfathomable; he makes the character sympathetic.
This Joker, or more precisely, Arthur Fleck, is just an ordinary individual you could easily encounter in the street, who's constantly laughing from the pain of his mere existence. This guy can't catch a break, as he is continuously pushed around and mentally tormented by the world around him, and I could not help but feel pity and remorse for the guy. Even the most subtle nuances Phoenix imposes, such as his changing tone of voice or the way he walks makes his portrayal feel all the more real. When Fleck finally snaps back at the world, I didn't necessarily barrack for him, as his actions are violent and gruesome. However, I was deeply fascinated by how Fleck finally accepts himself as a sociopathic maniac and seeks his own personal justice through the persona of the Joker.
The rest of the supporting cast does a serviceable job, especially Robert De Niro, who hasn't given a performance this lively in years. But Phoenix is the main attraction, and rightfully so. To make the comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker and argue who's better would be pointless. This is a very different portrayal, and I believe the best of both worlds should be embraced.Apart from my ravings about Phoenix, I was very impressed with Todd Phillips' direction, especially considering his previous filmography comprises of sex comedies. Without going too far into spoiler territory, I found the way Phillips chose to tell this story pleasantly surprising. It takes a similar route to something like 'Fight Club' or 'American Psycho', wherein you're unsure whether all the events unfolding on-screen are actually happening in reality or merely the character's imagination. I believe it could be an entirely plausible origin for the Joker in the comics.
Under Phillips' guidance, the majority of the stylistic features are efficiently executed. The muted colour palette and handheld cinematography compliment the film's gritty, realistic tone very well. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's score, which is mainly comprised of cellos and other stringed instruments, is hauntingly beautiful. It subtly underscores the Joker's deeper delving into crime and insanity until it crescendos into an anxiety-inducing orchestra when full-on chaos unfolds.My only issue with the film is despite its aims to be a standalone character study, it still dares to shoehorn in tributes and references to the comics. This is only done to a minor extent but it just felt jarring because it did not contribute to the story being told whatsoever.Although I had optimistic hopes for this film, I was still blown away by it. Overall, it was just nice to see a comic book movie that isn't part of a greater cinematic universe that has to set up multiple sequels. Despite all the controversy and criticism swirling around the film's release, I have no doubt over time it will be considered one of the great films of this decade. It is not the perfect comic book movie, but it is rather, the most personal comic book movie I've ever seen.",0

Joker,Confronting and masterful,"I did not know what to expect from this film but what I walked away with was an appreciation of the master of his craft that is Joaquin Phoenix. His gradual metamorphosis into a man disconnected and disassociated with society and its norms is quite simply brilliant. No other actor could have performed this role so well. He is mesmerising. The story is riveting and confronting. The city of Gotham, covered in rubbish and rats is a powerful metaphor for the decay of society and its civility. It is represented as cruel, cold, and degenerating into chaos. There is no reprieve, no hero to save the day. We are exposed to our real selves otherwise hidden by the mask worn by Arthur Fleck. The script, cinematography and score are sublime but Phoenix is the star of this film and must win an Oscar for this role. There is no performance in recent times that compares to it.2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

You gonna feel his struggle, his pain, everything he's going through in the entire movie. And you can understand why he did that despite knowing what he's doing is wrong.

Joker,It should have been Commodus (Gladiator) 19 years ago - It'll be Arthur Fleck,"19 years ago, Joaqin Phoenix was robbed of his Oscar but this time it'll be almost impossible to top this performance this year in movies.Phoenix dazzles as this sort of distressed, twisted character that has everything in life going against him. Gotham truly is a cruel city and you end the movie questioning whose side you're on.The links to to Wayne family in this picture also grow the folklore around the Joker-Batman dynamic and you get a greater sense as to why their stories are so intertwined. Really classy touch.Going into this, I felt this 2hour + movie would drag but each and every scene meshes well together, the 1st act makes you grow attached to Arthur as he battles against these demons in his life and the middle & final acts pay your patience with a bunch of twists & turns that you didn't see coming.Worth every second, tightly written script and I can't wait for what DC has in store for us moving forward with these stand alone features. 10/10",0
Joker,Very interesting take of The Joker,"Not like the other Jokers. Not even the same genre.

Joaquin Pheonix is incredible and deserves every bit of the Oscar. You forget Pheonix is even in this film because you are so lost in his character. The score is magnificent, that was actually my first thought after watching this film, I thought it would be a crime if Joker didn't win the Oscar for best score.
The way the story ties into the world of Gotham and Batman is extra bonus. You must not forget the setting this movie takes place. Your brain wants to say it's New York City, but it's not. It's Gotham.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,the revolution,"As usual in a case where people leap to extremes, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Joker may make some people who feel marginalized feel more seen and more powerful, and they may act out in response. There are some ugly, self-serving messages in the movie, which is incongruously bent on creating sympathy for Batman's worst enemy and one of DC Comics' most notoriously callous mass murderers and atrocity architects. But love it or hate it, the film does spin up a tempting fantasy of persecution and relief, of embracing nihilism as a means of complete escape from a terrible world1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A haunting drama about one of the greatest villains ever.,"I now think I could've actually seen it while it was playing in cinemas. It was really a somber, dark and disturbing drama film that only got better with every passing second. Joaquin Phoenix has delivered a really outstanding performance, and now I really believe it, having seen it myself! Also, kudos to Todd Phillips for not only directing it brilliantly but also for keeping it less than 2 hours and focusing on just the important parts.Joker is not a superhero film despite being set in the same universe as Batman. It's a very, very dark film that is just hard to ""enjoy"". It's entertaining and captivating, but not in the way you might think. There are no ""wow"" moments in it, and all I could feel was sad at times for Arthur before he became the Joker.Joker is definitely not for you if you're easily turned off by some graphic gore or afraid of disturbing characters. If Todd intended to show us the human beneath the psychopath, I'd say he won, at least for more than half of the movie's duration. Joker has got a strong performance from Phoenix, intense conversations and also some really gorgeous visuals. This film is like a comic book that turns out to be a pretty good character study.",0
Joker,Great insight...,"This movie is at it's best a great insight on how people can be total jerks to other people and how it can affect the ones they act that way towards. It can send some people off the deep end of the world, to to the fact that you nevermind know who, what, when, how, or why the one being bullied, picked on, or shamed by other people in society. I as a parent recommend this movie and I recommend you show it to your children so they can see what can happen to people that are being bullied, or picked on even though this is just one example of what can happen in real life because you never know what effect your actions or words have on others.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,A true masterpiece!,"I have notice a lot of people try to draw comprising which (in my view) are completely missed.
This is not a typical DC/superhero type movie. It has nothing to do with Heath Ledger. Would he be proud? Probably. He was brilliant in his own way; however he stared in a DC movie and was your typical Joker (having said that he executed it brilliantly).Now, this movie is different - it is a case study of mental illness. Very deep and heavy going, nonetheless accurate and beautiful in a way. It may as well be considered a movie on its own, without any connections with Gotham, the Joker character, the comic books etc etc. If anything - Taxi Driver (1976) and the King of Comedy (1982) are closer to it than any of the Batman or other DC shows you have seen in the past.Joaquin Phoenix is the best actor of his generation. By far and undoubtedly.
What he did in this film is remarkable. I left the cinema absolutely speechless and moved at the same time.
It is a masterpiece!",0
Joker,Brilliant and Grim Masterpiece,"In recent years, superhero movies have filled the theaters. This film is unlike any of them. Gritty and realistic it's label as dangerous by the media is well-deserved. This is not because of excessive violence but rather, it is because Arthur Fleck is such a relatable and sympathetic character for so many people.He's not a full-blown psychotic nor is he a calculated psychopath. He is a generally polite, lonely and isolated guy who is in that in between. He's healthy enough to work a job but not healthy enough to thrive or excel. His head is just barely above water, so to speak. His unraveling throughout the movie has less to do with a worsening illness like schizophrenia and more to do with the realistic actions of the society around him.By brilliantly using an accurate depiction of society's actions as a mechanism for his development, it creates a story that rings true. It also creates a deeply sympathetic and almost justified character. Unlike Heath Ledger's agent of chaos Joker, this Joker is fighting against a society that has genuinely failed and mistreated him (and so many others, as the ending shows).All in all, I would say this movie was a masterpiece. It explained a realistic and interesting backstory for a character who is really part of the fabric of American culture. It also highlighted a very overlooked segment of society and looked at real issues that they are facing.",0

Joker,Decline and Fall,"Joker has managed to stir up a whirlwind of controversy, centring partly around the level of violence included but also on the use of ""that song"" on the soundtrack. But putting aside that flurry of commentary, what of the film itself?Man, this is a dark film! It's as much of an anti-superhero film as this year's ""Brightburn"". The Batman legacy has addressed the mental state of the protagonists before (both that of the hero and the villains). Here we have a real study of how a mentally unstable no-hoper can be pushed over the edge by bigotry, carelessness and government cut-backs.Indeed, there is something alarmingly prescient about the movie's plot line, watching this as we (in the UK) are in the month of possible (or as Boris Johnson would say, definite) Brexit madness!After reviewing ""Judy"" I wouldn't be the least surprised if I'd just seen the Best Actress award bagged (by Ren√©e Zellweger). Now, with ""Joker"", surely Joachim Phoenix might bag his first (and well overdue in my book) Oscar. Although nominated before (for ""Gladiator"", ""Walk the Line"" and ""The Master"") he's never won. Here Phoenix's physical transformation into Arthur Fleck is SIMPLY EXTRAORDINARY. And the way he captures the (medically) induced fits of helpless laughter, ending in a sort of choking fit, is brilliant and replicated to a 'T' on multiple occasions.I loved ""You Were Never Really Here"", primarily due to Phoenix's pitch-perfect performance. And ""Joker"" reminded me very much of Lynne Ramsey's film: a disturbed loner, looking after his elderly mother; with violence meted out to wrong-doers. Joe is almost the yin to Arthur Fleck's yang: Joe is an invisible man who is very much present; Arthur is a very visible man who thinks he is invisible. There's even comment by Fleck towards the end of the film that sometimes he thinks he's 'not really there at all'! (A deliberate 'in' joke in reference to that film?)After some pretty poor ""pension grabs"" in recent years, culminating in the appalling career- nadir of ""Dirty Grandpa"" in 2016, Robert De Niro comes good with a fine performance as the idolised but thoughtless and cruel talk-show host Murray Franklin. It's very much a supporting role, but delivered with great aplomb.Also great again is ""Deadpool 2""'s Zazie Beetz (a great trivia answer for an actor with three 'z's' in the name). This angle of the story is deviously clever, and Zazie handles the various twists and turns brilliantly.Movie violence needs to be taken in context to both the film's story and to the movie's certificate. For those expecting a light and fluffy ""Avengers"" style of movie, they might be shocked by what they see. True that the film definitely pushes the boundaries of what I think is acceptable in a UK15-certificate film. ... I suspect there were HEATED discussions at the BBFC after this screening! The violence though seems comparable to some other 15's I've seen: a DIY-store drill scene in ""The Equalizer"" comes to mind.A particularly brutal scene is reminiscent of a climactic scene in ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"", such that Quentin Tarantino might have just cause to appeal his 'UK18' certificate.You might argue about the level of violence that SHOULD be shown in a 15 certificate film. But I think the violence portrayed - given this is in the known context an origin story for a psychopathic killer - is appropriate. I personally found the Heath Ledger's Joker's ""pencil trick"" scene in ""The Dark Knight"" more disturbing, given it was a 12 certificate.I have less sympathy for the inclusion of ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" on the soundtrack.Where ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips does recover some of this respect is in the quality of the script (co-written with Scott Silver) and the direction. It's misdirection without mis-direction! Some of the twists in the plot (no spoilers here!) I did not see coming, and certain aspects of the story (again no spoilers!) are left brilliantly (and chillingly) vague.Sure, it borrows heavily in story-line and mood from Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"". And I was also reminded of 1993's Joel Schumacher flick ""Falling Down"" where Michael Douglas is an ordinary man pushed to the edge and beyond by a series of life's trials. But if you want to criticise a film for ""not being 100% original"" then let's start at the top of the 2019 IMDB listings and keep going! I've also seen comment from some that criticises the somewhat clunky overlay of the Batman back-story into the script. I also understand that view but I didn't personally share it.Elsewhere I would not be surprised if the movie gets garlanded with technical Oscar nominations aplenty come January. The cinematography, by Phillips-regular Lawrence Sher, is exquisite in setting the grimy 70's tone. (I loved the retro Warner Brothers logo too). And both video and sound editing is top-notch. Not forgetting a sonorous cello-heavy soundtrack that perfectly suits the mood. Want to put a bet on which film might top the ""number of Oscar nominations"" list? This might not be a bad choice.Final thoughts: Dark and brooding, with a slow-burn start, this is a proper drama that might make action superhero fans fidgety. But I simply loved it, and would love to carve out the time to give it a re-watch. The Phoenix performance is extraordinary. Will this make my Top 10 of the year? Fingers to head, and pull the trigger.... it's a no-brainer.",0

Joker,Oscar-worthy. A very human movie.,"I saw Joker last night at the Studio Movie Grill in Marietta, GA. There were two police officers on hand, but it was a very calm and peaceful evening. The theater was completely full and there were a lot of people who clapped and even cried during the movie. However, not once did I ever fear for my safety or my life. Never once did I feel or sense there was going to be anarchy, chaos, or a riot after the movie. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE. Just like any other action movie with guns, violence, and killing in it (F&F, John Wick, etc., etc.). All in all, I thought 2019's Joker was a great movie. It was a very human movie. It show's a man who's been broken down, beaten, lied to, and mistreated his whole life. A man who feels isolated, alone, unwanted, and unloved in a system and society completely against him. Because of the way the film is portrayed and because of the incredible talent of Joaquin Phoenix, you can empathize and sympathize with his character. You feel sorry for him and all of the incredibly unjust bs he goes through. You may even find yourself wishing you could help him. Because of that, you can understand his descent into madness and the reason behind all of his characters' actions (not that they were wholly just or correct by any means). It gave depth and insight into the Joker's and Batman's (Bruce Wayne's) relationship and their history as a prequel movie. The ONLY things I can think of why certain groups of people might be against this movie are: 1) They don't like DC Comics or Batman. 2) They don't like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. 3) They're afraid that the movie will empower self-righteous people who are fed-up with a corrupt government into taking action and causing Anarchy (like in the movie). 4) They think that grown adults don't have any common sense and/or general reasoning skills, can't distinguish between reality and fiction, and cannot control their own thoughts and actions.",0

Joker,A masterpiece depiction of a dystopian society,"11 years ago I watched The Dark Knight and enthralled by the fact that how a person can act as so naive.. How a person does not suffer any qualms of conscience for the horrible things he has done... How a person sees the cruel and brutal things as a joke... 11 years later I got the answer... Absolute ingenious direction and screenplay... Scorcseseian touches makes it more cinematic... 80's flavours and retro vibes takes us right into the dark alleys of Gotham and the 70's depression... This movie proves that the personality/origin of a character is greatly affected by childhood abuse. Todd Phillips has done quite a nice depiction of it. The highly unsettling tones and real life situation makes one really uncomfortable at times... Sometimes we see ourselves in the big shoes of the clown prince of Crime. The great toxicity, graphic novel easter eggs, really dark background, brutal violence makes it an R-rated without showing any sexually explicit materials.
Last but not the least is the character acting of Joaquin Phoenix. The 4 sets of laughs consisting of Pretentious Laugh , Sarcastic Laugh , Happy laughs and the most unnerving laughs from emotional outbursts originated from his mother's abuse in the childhood gives him a complex personality and adds new depths. Oscar-worthy portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix.... Kudos!!!",0
Joker,Joker's totally worth the hype.,"It's the pictorial representation of how a society makes a serial killer out of a mentally ill person. It shows how some people look at the disabled. Not all of it is exact and after all it's a movie... About the people talking about it affecting mindsets of the audience and leaving a negative impact, it all depends on the interpretation of the viewer. It is really violent and bold. But I never ever think that it will affect people in a bad way. So we should really enjoy it as a film, there have been films that are more violent and they should've not even released...
About the crew, Phoenix is wonderful, scary and really really unpredictable. Todd Phillips has done a great job. Great supporting cast.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"The best film I have ever seen in my entire life, and likely always will be.","I have watched this movie 4 times so far at the theatres. The importance of the message in this film when it comes to mental illness, neglect, and abuse of those who just want happiness and equal-treatment is absolutely paramount and incredibly true to every day life in this struggling world. The performances (all of them, but especially Joaquin's) are perfect all the way through...but the scene that takes place on the Murray late show is the single best scene in cinema history, in my opinion.Rating: Perfection/101 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Instant Classic,"This film deserves every award available. Joaquin for best actor because he is absolutely brilliant. People throw that around, I know, but he really is. The writing/directing/cinematography/music all of it. It's never slow, nothing is ""filler"", everything has purpose, and it cooks along, building and building. I walked out of the theater and wanted to go right back in and watch it again.Joker is in a class of it's own even outside of the superhero genre. This film would completely stand on it's own with the story it tells (change a couple of names). As a part of the Batman legacy it adds a richness and depth to the overall story of Batman, even though specific to this character. It will fit seamlessly for someone who purchases this for their collection.No, it is not a movie for young children. Neither was The Godfather. Some stories are not meant for children, that doesn't mean adults shouldn't see a grown-up explanation with Joker that you actually have to think about. Heaven forbid we have a movie that makes us think about anything. Kids will see enough of Joker in Batman movies.It's not a shallow 'waste a couple hours'. This is a thinking person's cinematic triumph. There is a severity in here that the Batman story deserves, and that this character really does benefit from. This is the Joker movie that needed to be made. When I say severity it's not the violence, there are many violent movies/Tv shows. The severity is in the relationships, the character development, how do we process the things the film forces us to think about and feel. Things are not black and white.As far as violence I've seen worse on TV shows. The Walking Dead, Vikings, Game of Thrones, and more. The violence in Joker is not there without reason, it serves a purpose to the story. I can bring up videos on the internet of things that have shown up on the news. There is nothing wilder in Joker than what you see on tv without the pixels (I'm trying to leave out spoilers). Some of the media regarding this, and reaction (whomever it was that walked out) is ridiculous and overblown. It is R rated. The news should be R rated. So just consider this a documentary and get over it or don't watch.I congratulate the writers/director and Joaquin Phoenix. Anyone who worked on this project too. Bravo and thank you, really.PS
I so admire Heath Ledger's portrayal. I thought nothing would ever touch that. Well don't even try to compare is what I would say now. Heath's film has a different purpose and is in a different time in Joker's life. I don't think they can be compared but they are both powerful. They are complementary rather than competitive. Put Heath's Joker completely out of your head for this. I don't think it's even fair to compare the two now. I'm also pretty sure if Heath Ledger were still alive he would be ecstatic over Joaquin's performance.",0
Joker,Marvellous movie,First of all its a very intense movie. You can hardly take so much in one sitting.They want you to behave normally while having a mental condition you cant. As long as you pretend to be kind in a ruthless society no one gives a damn. The moment you bring your crazy stuff outside they take you as role models.This movie has a talent of brining out the most intense scenes and yet make you laugh. It has all the elements in it. IT IS TOO MUCH TO TAKE IN ONE SITTING.Its the best movie ever!!!!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0
Joker,"Greatest movie in probably 30 years. True art, completely forgoten by modern times.","It is needlessly to list all the reasons this makes Such unbelievable movie.

Joker,JOKER IS A MUST SEE!,"Masterpiece from beginning to end. From the cinematography to the acting.. It's extremely relatable and filled with necessary lessons and messages. The exploration of mental illness forces viewers to have a deeper understanding for not only Arthur Fleck/Joker, but people in OUR society. Joaquin's performance was impeccable as always. This movie was so mesmerizing and had me on an emotional rollercoaster. I didn't want it to end! Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

Joker,"A timely, relevant and powerful film reflecting society's dark side.","WOW! Where do I even begin? Not for such a long time has a film had such a profound affect on me. I can honestly say that ""Joker"" (2019) is perhaps the best film I have ever seen. The commentary on class, politics and mental health has never been more relevant than it is today. The film is an incredible character study in to the psyche and origins of one of comic books' greatest ever villains. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the accompanying score and soundtrack absolutely perfect. I literally couldn't look away from the screen from beginning to end and Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal in the role, and every bit of his performance is Oscar worthy as we watch mental health and unfortunate circumstances propel Arthur Fleck in to the downward spiral that makes him become The Joker. The script is full of powerful moments that director Todd Phillips brings to life perfectly. This is definitely Joker's movie but it also ties in to the Batman mythology perfectly. Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy also offer a great turn in supporting roles. Is the movie as hyper-violent has critics make out. No. Is it a gritty, realistic, and uncomfortable reflection of society? Absolutely.
I can't wait to watch this again. Perfect movie. 10/10.",0
Joker,Absolutely amazing. The best film I've watched in years.,"Honestly, I didn't even want to go see this film. I had no interest in it whatsoever. I've never been a huge fan of the leading man, I wasn't thrilled about seeing any new film since the last three I walked out on. I walked out on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Ad Astra, and Spider-Man: Far from Home, the first two bored the heck out of me. JOKER, on the other hand, was intense.....I-N-T-E-N-S-E!!! Joaquin Phoenix played his role of a lifetime to perfection. Possibly the most impressive acting I've seen by anyone, in any film, ever! There is NO WAY that he isn't going to get the Best Leading Man award at the next Oscar show, no way.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A descent into madness,"This is brilliant, but disturbing film-making.
Joaquin Phoenix gives an amazing performance as a man being beaten into madness, rather than heading there under his own steam. As such, the film treads a delicate line between feeling pity for Arthur Fleck (Joker), being repulsed and disturbed by him and rooting for him to succeed in his twisted ambitions.
When watching this film, pay attention to Fleck's body language. Observe how, in the comedy club, he doesn't laugh when every else does, and laughs when no-one else does. It is this subtle attention to detail which raises the level of this film.
If this wasn't a ""superhero"" based movie, it would be guaranteed awards. But coming from comic book source material, I suspect that it will be largely ignored come awards season.
Go and see this movie. It is definitely getting crazier out there!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Joker - an instant comic book classic,"Joker (2019)
Directed by Todd Phillips
Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Zazie Beets, and Robert De Niro.
5/5I saw this film when it came out in theaters, feels kinda late after all these people saw it at the film festivals. I'm just gonna write this review now. This film was what I came in expecting. A gritty, gory (not that gory tbh) Martin Scorsese style movie (clearly to the likes of classics such as The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver), featuring Joaquin Phoenix as the second best on screen Joker - Heath Ledger is undefeated in my book. Joaquin definitely deserves an Oscar. The film was 2 hours, but my god, what a rollercoaster, it flew FAST! Similar to the Dark Knight trilogy, this was NOT a typical superhero/villain film. In fact it was anything but. You could look at this film and remove any Batman/Wayne/Joker details and it still feels like an intense movie focusing on a deeply depressed man. Wow. Just wow. I was speechless after watching it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Joker is the best movie of 2019,"I was in need for a movie like this and I didn't even know.
The theme is so pertinent and important and to all the people who fear this movie is going to incite violence, I think it's the other way. It teaches us we need to be more empathetic and pay more attention to the person next to us and how we, as a system, fail continuously to protect people.
Everything is perfect since Phoenix's performance (Ledger must be so proud) to the superb job of Todd Phillips, where every detail is thought and well-placed.
I highly recommend you to watch the movie but, most importantly, to think about it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,10/10 for everything,"Oh my....and for years Heath Ledgers version of Joker was my favourite, up until now, I thought Joaquin Phoenix version was as equally if not just about marginally better, a very worthy Oscar winning performance, he was outstandingly brilliant from start to finish, and the story filled in a lot of early story arc for the batman movies, I hope the director Todd Phillips and Joaquin get to continue this story and bring Batman into the fold that would be epic1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,brilliant!!! One of the best movies of this decade!,"I created an imdb account only to give this movie a 10/10 because I really disagree with the negative critics. A brilliant, dark, disturbing and moving masterpiece of a movie that makes you think and question your definitions of good and bad. Unlike the opinion of the critics, the fact that the movie uses the character of the joker to connect a comic personality to the complex development of mental illness and to hold a mirror in front of the problems of today's society is exactly what makes this movie so brilliant to me.
And then there is the outstanding and brilliant acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It feels like he put 200% of himself into this role and he portrays the highly complex levels of mental illness and the character development of Arthur Fleck slowly becoming the Joker in an outstanding way. Brilliant performance that truly felt like art, this is what real acting should be like. Hands down deserves to win the Oscar for this!

Joker,Joker and Joaquin Phoenix justify the need of The Dark Knight,"Joker is the character sketch of Arthur Fleck, a young man aspiring to be a stand up comedian but suffering from multiple psychological and physical disorders. One of his serious shortcomings is that when he is nervous, he laughs uncontrollably, thus giving those around him the impression of ridicule and impunity. His strange mannerisms add to the complexity leading to Arthur becoming the cynosure of social ostracism and wholesome rejection, including physical excesses. He lives with his mother Penny, a debilitated woman also with mental issues. Arthur's life is one of an almost invisible and reclusive existence, something that's not acceptable to him. The social repulsion takes its final toll when the psychologist treats him with utter contempt and cuts off his medication. The situation sends him spiralling down into a psychological spin resulting in a social revolt and unbridled violent crimes that he has no remorse for.That's the birth of Joker for you which will connect with The Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne. Joker is an extremely volatile and complex character for whom your heart may cry out for sympathy in a moment and almost simultaneously look for a social rationale for his return to socially acceptable behaviour. Joaquin Phoenix has gotten under the skin of the character, yearning for sympathy, yet loathsome and abhorrent. Such maniacal is his demonstration of the nadir of his existence that the glorification of which has perhaps no comparison in modern times. Joker justifies the need of a vigilante for the return of control over Gotham, reeling from riotous behaviour of the less fortunate. The intensity of the character, physical nuances, volatility and subterfuge related histrionics of Joaquin Phoenix are in a class seldom witnessed in cinema - he pretty much is the prelude to Heath Ledger's Joker, almost seamlessly justifying the character. This rendition does deserve the standing ovation it got and is worth its weight in gold. Take a bow director Todd Phillips!",0

Joker,"Psychological, Terrifying And...Dark","After I left the movie theater, I was trying to ellaborate a thought about the movie and I finally realized, after a while, that I had so many thoughts about it that I couldn't even choose what to think about and that is the true power of a masterpiece movie!About Todd Phillips... Have mercy, how is it possible passing from a triology of comedy to a very psychological, terrifying, dark and twisted kind of movie? The fact that Todd Phillips embraced the project with open arms, asking for script reviews and trying to define a production model identical as we saw in King of Comedy or Taxi Driver from Martin Scorsese is gratifying! Todd Phillips is a master not just because he did what he did, but because he picked the most loved villain in comic history and he broked all the rules about following the origins story. Instead, he created an alternative character, explored his origins and placed it on a broken society that can actually be seen as the true villain of this story!.Joaquin Phoenix ( and I never get tired out saying this ) is an excellent, genius and a phenomenon actor. After minus fifty-two pound of weight, discouvering is body afterwards ( related to his movements on the movie ) and still play a character like this... It's is something we can not just say ""Eh, good job"", because good job are two killer words, what we need to say is ""You were epic, you did what you did and now... you are a legend!"" Brand new body movements, a brand new laughing is introduced, a great interpretation of the character... what can I say more? He is a legend! He introduced to us a poor man that lived with his mother in a cheap apartement, having a mental disorder that made him laugh in a very uncontrollaby way, full of pain when everything he wanted was...bring joy to the world and put on a happy face, turning Arthur Fleck into a very psychological, terrifying and dark man, known as...Joker!Congrats to everybody that made this film possible!",0
Joker,Best origin film,Great origin story.... Was well worth the watch.... References or easter eggs throughout was good...

Great stand alone film...think people expected the same thing as usual you see in dc or marvel films and follow up to what we all now... But it's not... Expands beyond that...

Joker,A TRIUMPH,"JOKER is an absolute triumph of modern-day cinema. A depressing, exciting, horrifying, morbid, sad and multilayered masterpiece featuring one of the most riveting und heart-wrenching performances by an actor you're ever going to have the pleasure (and honour!) of witnessing on the big screen. Another (and perhaps the very best!) career-defining role by Joaquin Phoenix whose unquestionable talent is only rivaled by his 100% dedication to the craft of being one of the very best in what he does. And what he does in this film could only be described as a deep dive into the depths of one troubled soul and its tense relationship with a violent and uncaring world. Like Arthur's own reality. A reality that could chew and then spit you out like a tasteless fly. It clearly suggests to us that everyone's sanity has his/her limits, so when we pass beyond them and stop pretending that everything's "" ""eventually going to be alright"", breaking the conventional artificial rules becomes the new norm. When everyone denies you love and legitimate care, you hit them back with as much hatred and anger as possible. If we are to live in a jungle, then one should start playing by its crude ancient rules. Or at least that's what the Joker wants us to think, because after all - he's telling us the story... from HIS perspective, right? But does that change the fact that his world, his dark and filthy Gotham City seems so awfully familiar???Todd Phillips' Arthur Fleck/Joker... You will like him. You will sympathize with him. You will cry for him. You will be scared of him. You will hate him. But most importantly - you will... understand him. And that may just as well be one of the most cathartic moments in your life as a moviegoer... and nevertheless as a member of a SOCIETY that unfortunately is still way too effective in creating monsters that no one can control. Monsters that we refuse to take the responsibility for and who may one day force us (in the worst case scenario) to pay the bitter price for our negligence.A DEFINITE MUST-SEE!!! This film is an event and Joaquin's performance is one for the ages. It will definitely go down in history as one worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Brando's Don Vito Corleone, Daniel Day-Lewis' Daniel Plainview, Jack Nicholson's McMurphy and Heath Ledger's own version of that iconic character in every single ""All-Time Greatest Character Portrayals"" list you can get your hands on. Arthur's character arc is absolutely not the only ace that this film has up its sleeve: the mesmerizing soundtrack by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir, the captivating visual storytelling achieved though Lawrence Sher's masterful cinematographic approach, the unexpected re-imagining of Thomas Wayne - there're so many more things to love and contemplate about after seeing that amazing masterpiece. You can be sure of it ;)12 out 10 stars :)",0
Joker,A Masterpiece. A love letter. The truth.,"Have you ever felt that movies of present era are too tasteless? Doesn't appeal to the emotion of an individual? Cannot portray a moral value without cringe? Actors involved do acting which is unrelatable? Then Joker is the movie for you.For me, the Joker is a love letter , a magnumopus art which appeals to the heart of people. It's like the director was in my mind the whole time and gave me exactly what I wanted.The acting is above oscar level. If Phoenix doesn't get an oscar for this then maybe oscars doesn't deserve him. His laugh,his pain,his helplessness is soo real I wonder how can any human act like this! I cried twice while I was in hall just because I couldn't see how selfish we humans are and how certain people have worst day of their lives just because we can't share few kind words them.The reason why it so special is because it doesn't have the same hero,heroine hero wins everything is good ending. Here the actual story is shown. There is no hero but only villains which prey on the innocent. Call me cynical but I was glad Arthur killed those people and brought chaos. I am literally tired of people thinking that there is a happy ending in real world for people who are suffering. There is no happy ending and there is no guy who cares about you.Dialogues like "" What is with you people?"", ""Why is everyone so rude?"", ""Don't call my mother that."", ""I don't want to make you feel awkward."", are soo real it makes you think that many people are living a lonely depressing life just because we can't share few kind words but would rather supress such people to impress our friends who are equally messed up.Joker is the best movie I have ever seen in all my life and I doubt if any other movie will ever surpass it.I know that it doesn't have any CGI fights, superhero,happy ending for society, beautiful heroine or comedy. But what it does have is realistic acting, acknowledging moral values without element of forcing it upon us , the reality of society rather than 'everything is allright' and THIS IS HOW A MOVIE SHOULD BE.What I am trying to say is, if you have a heart then you can't help but agree with the joker.",0
Joker,A Psycologicaly thrilling look on society and the tale of a broken man,"There have been many Joker's, Mark Hammil, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, Jack Nicholson and many more who have all thrown their hat in the ring and tried their hand at portraying the greatest villain in comic history, many were good but none come close to Joaquin Phoenix performance of the classic villain. However, before I get too far ahead of myself I should address the fact there may be a couple spoilers in this review so be warned (I'll do my best to keep them to a minimum).First of all, going back to what I previously stated, Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is nothing but perfection. He truly personifies a villain created by society's greatest failures and shortcomings. However, where his depiction truly shines is the stark contrast between this Joker and almost every other Joker. None have ever come close to this level of pure emotion in the character, even seemingly small things like his physical appearance; the rugged hair, the protruding spine, the inhumanly white skin, all this adds to the effect of pure psychological terror.Slightly straying away from Phoenix, I'd like to focus on the character of Joker in this movie (To reiterate-possible spoilers ahead). As I previously subjected, this Joker is extremely different to any other Joker we've seen before, mainly down to the raw emotions we see from him, of which we've never really seen the likes of. This movie delves deep into his relationship with the waynes, his mother and the rest of Gotham as a whole, he was a man trying to be normal who was utterly betrayed by society.Further continuing my point about Gotham, I'd like to commend the production team for making sure every set was as accurate to what Gotham would look like as they could make it, it really drives home how awful Gotham truly is. From the start we see how much of a wreck Gotham is and how dysfunctional of a society it is. There have been very few pieces of media that relates to this level of 'awfulness', from the top of my head, i'd probably name the Arkham games or maybe the telltale series but neither came close to showing how bad of a situation that Gotham was in, riots on the streets, litter spewed everywhere and poverty run amuck. Prime conditions for festering hatred and birthing psychopaths.There are so few flaws with this film, you could count them with a single hand. However I feel like many may be disappointed by the ending, it's a little anticlimactic but still leaves an interesting possibility to be theorised.But now I think I'll stop myself anymore said and the film would be well and truly spoiled for you, so in conclusion: Go watch this film! It deserves all the praise it gets and more and I hope this is an outlet for us to see more films where we look from the 'bad guy' perspective and delve into their inner thoughts and feelings.Keep being awesome, peace out.",0

It's a masterpiece in character study filled with this beautifully ironic comedy - the kind of comedy that occurs when you are trying so hard and life just smacks you in the face in the worst of ways. It's so much more than just the ""making of a killer"", but more so the perfect storm of mental illness and a failing mental health system, combined with a series of traumatic events, father issues, failure of professional success (thusly the fear that he will always be a failure), and the trials of near daily bullying, simply as a result of being eccentric.There is violence, but I've witnessed 80/90's action movies that make this pale in comparison.You will be glued to the screen.. not a single person got up to go to the restroom or get a refill....well, this maybe an exaggeration as I was so focused on the movie that it was as if I was transported to a time when movies were legit.Please see this movie.",0
Joker,"Absolute must see, regardless of previous movie preferences","This is the first time I have ever taken the time to review a film on IMDB. Joker is an absolute masterpiece. I believe it will be disected and discussed for decades to come.""Having seen joker 3 times now, I have finally concluded that it is one of the best films ever made. All aspects of the film (cinematography, score, acting, script, etc.) have excelled way more than I have ever seen in any film before.I love that I can interpret the movie entirely different than someone else. I love the attention to detail. I love the insane deep intracacies of Arthur's mind.There is so much to talk about, either within the mivie or yourself1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,One of the best films I've ever seen.,I simply do not know how to begin reviewing this masterpiece. It is indeed a cinematic artwork. Not to speak about Phoenix' performance which was simply thrilling and magnetic. I was worried because of the hype of it but this work does justice to every expectation I ever had and even managed to exceed them.

Joker,No Joke .. pure Exelence.,"I dont give 10 often in here, really good film get a 9 - but when i leave the theater with my mouth open, full of feelings and and this .. you know it .. ""What just happend there"" feeling. I give a 10 readily and happily, only regretting there is no 11 in IMDB.But your Mindset must be open, expect not a hero movie.

Joker,Unexpected creative genius!,"I loved it!!!Storyline: A backstory for The Joker has never been done on the big screen before and I can honestly say I was skeptical about it because his story would have to be complex and nearly impossible to tell especially if you don't have an actor who's capable of portraying the complexity of the character, but I was pleasantly surprised with every aspect of this film from the original storyline that gives him a different story from his initial backstory in the comics and his return story when he was reborn in the first Robin. This story incorporates all of the issues of today and today's society that have always existed but is being told during the time of the 70s/80s. It's also very modern and foretelling of a future that everyone should expect if things continue on the current path. The dismissal of mental health being a reality that is usually ignored and handled by overmedicating is a huge issue that's addressed. The crippling economy and the separation of the wealth classes and how it affects us all is also covered. Abuse of almost every form is discussed and the effects of it are clearly seen. His outcome was predictable considering the tragedy of his life.Thomas Wayne was everything I thought the real Thomas Wayne would've been. He's a hero to his young son because he didn't live long enough for Bruce to see who he really was and become corrupted morally by him, but Thomas is an entitled, privileged monster who judges the common man far too harshly and refuses to see that he's a part of the problem.Cast: Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most underrated actors and even though I've always thought that he is one of the few actors who actually becomes the character he's playing, I can also admit that I didn't think he had what it takes to not only play the role of the Joker, but also be the best version of the Joker outside of the animated version voiced by Mark Hamill.No one can play the crazy mother better than Frances Conroy.Overall I gave it a 10. It was a breath of fresh air to see something honest come out of Hollywood. DC comics are dark. All of the movies should be rated R for the most part to capture the true nature of the story of the characters. Hopefully this movie means DC movies are being reborn and retold with more authenticity and accuracy that compliments their darker nature.It's a must see.",0
Joker,Who's laughing now ?,"It's been a while since a real and good movie was released. The last 2-3 years were a succession of 'so so' movies with no depth, PC ones and of course $200 millions budget Avengers and others garbage fest(the 1st iron man and avengers were decent).
Joker is a real movie, entertaining, making you think, and of course creating a wide range of emotions: disgust, fear, empathy, angriness, joy, sadness... I doubt that Phillips voluntarily implanted all these concepts but rather try to describe a story that is real in a sense and so it is relatable.
I saw some critics and I don't get them. Do they know what movies are about ? They just take shortcut, have no clue about societal issues and how assassins and dictators rise. Most of them focus on how the movie tries to make you empathic with psychopaths; it does not and the 4th murder confirms this. It just tells us that society makes us good or bad and than humans are complex and fragile. So ignore these joker of a critic.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,A masterpiece that is created in decades,"From the beginning of the movie, i felt so attached with the character. I could see, it was portraying a lot of people's lives. I would see the violent part as it is, we should address it as reality rather than some fake looking acting. The movie is already 18+. So, talking about the violence doesn't make sense.One of the best pictures of this decade which a lot of people would empathize.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,1 of if not the best comic film in a long time,I've been waiting for this film since it was 1st announced and I'm happy to say that it surpasses all of my expectations. Had to watch it twice to fully process everything. Joaquin Phoenixs' performance was just incredible. I didn't think he could come close to Heath Ledgers performance. Not saying he surpasses Ledgers performance or anything. But this interpretation of the clown prince of crime is an absolute joy to watch as you get to actually see how bad of a day he had to fully lose his mind. Expertly directed by Philips....a must watch.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0
Joker,Not Your Classic Joker,"The title of my review sounds negative, but the stars will show otherwise.
This movie is a stand-alone film, and this joker will not be making an appearance in any other film, it's just simply an origin story. Aside from The Killing Joke, very little is said of the joker's origins in the comic world, so this movie was able to take the stand up comedian + mental breakdown (albeit, a slow one is this case) and begin to show how the joker became The Joker.
Best thing about this character? He's always been vague, so in all the renditions of the Joker they're all specific to the person portraying them. Where all The Batman's watch other Batmen and try to play as closely to that as you can, all the actors that play the Joker BECOME the Joker, making them each so unique. It really is what began the idea that the Joker isnt always the same person, but an idea and a figure that keeps inspiring new ones.
***Back to my review of the actual movie***
Don't go in expecting Nicholson or Ledger (but just be glad it isn't Leto's version), but it's beautifully done. It's not straight out of that comics because they wanted it too feel real, and it did just that. Why do you think people are becoming worried of the negative impacts it may have on some viewers? Because mental health is a real thing, and where the Joker May be an extreme consequence of that, it's still an issue that becomes more prevalent everyday. It blurs the lines on whether Joker is a hero or a villain because it's an ORIGIN story. He spends the movie trying to figure out who he is, and it's at the end that he shows it, and that portrayal is spot on. Joker spends his days reminding Batman of how similar they are, and that similarity really resonates with you in this film.
I'm just going to stop now because surely nobody will read my review all the way through after all the rabbit trailing thing I did.",0

Joker,The most important film of this decade.,"Joker answers a question any Batman fan will inevitably ask:We have Bruce Wayne's history in Batman Begins (which was excellent) but what about his nemesis, the Joker? Here you have it, folks. And it pulls no punches in explaining how a deranged sociopathic serial killer comes to be.Joker has a few laugh out loud moments, but for the most part it's a very dark, tragic tale of odds that are almost impossible to overcome and the inevitable consequences of isolation, loneliness, abuse... The very worst our world has to offer.Joker won't rake in the big bucks at the box office. Rather, 50 years from now it will be talked about as the most culturally important film of this decade.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Joker: A Deeply Unsettling Character Study About Social Isolation and Mental Illness,"Todd Phillip's Joker, a standalone film within the DC Universe, is a tragic and haunting cinematic masterpiece. A deeply unsettling film that belongs to the bygone era of the 70's and 80's. A type of film that Hollywood has since neglected in favour of producing big blockbuster franchises.Joker is not a film that everyone will enjoy and it was not produced for that purpose. Some will be put off by the dark bleak tone and the subject matter under discussion. While others will dislike the film for being extremely unconventional, especially for a character born within a superhero universe.Joker is a complex art house film that is essentially a psychologically driven character study of Arthur Fleck (also eventually known as Joker). It provides an insight into the brutal reality of social isolation, societal fragmentation and mental illness at a time when society lacks basic elements of empathy and humanity for its inhabitants.It is inspired and influenced by late 70's and early 80's art house films like Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Mean Streets, Network and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.In order for it to be widely accessible it has been dressed up in the garb of a mainstream Hollywood film. Yet, make no mistake, Joker is a piece of cinematic art that we have been deprived of for decades. A type of film that has been missing for a generation due to Hollywood's obsession with maintaining the status quo.Without spoiling the film, Joaquin Phoenix plays the titular character Joker, who turns in one of the most astonishing performances ever captured on film. He presents us with a portrayal of a failed stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck in Gotham City during the early 80's, who from the very first moment he is depicted on screen is shown struggling with mental illness. Over the next 2 hours, through no fault of his own, we are provided with a brutally powerful depiction of his apparent descent into madness.The film challenges and forces its audience to face themes they will find extremely uncomfortable. As a society we have made a habit of brushing our problems under the carpet. Joker not only lifts that rug, but it pulls it right from under our feet by showing us the brutal horror of what it means to be broken by society in every way imaginable.It is a film that is essentially about our ability to deal with trauma, our need for compassion and our capacity for destruction borne from the way we are treated by society. It is a story that should resonate with us on a personal level, about our position in society and how we deal with our own fragility and vulnerabilities. This includes our need to be accepted by others around us.The beauty of art house cinema is that it can be interpreted in a number of ways. However, several commentators have attempted to weaponise the film as a piece of political propaganda by interpreting it through the prism of the far right, Brexit, the Me-Too movement and Donald Trump. Sorry to disappoint those who choose to do so, but the film is not about any of those issues. This is something the protagonist makes very clear throughout the film.Rather, it points the camera inwards and presents us with a glimpse of our own insecurities. It highlights a personal and uncomfortable truth that no matter what we choose to identify as we are solitary human beings born on a planet which does not care whether we live or die, because the show must go on.Ever since we were children we have always been taught that if we live decent lives, are good to others then good will be done to us. But as adults, despite how uncomfortable it may be for many to admit, we have come to the painful realisation that in the societies we inhabit this is untrue.For many like Arthur, living in such an immoral and depraved world has led to perverse life changing experiences being inflicted upon them in their childhood that have carried on into adulthood through the manifestation of serious mental illnesses.Some social commentators have expressed how the film mocks mental health issues. It does nothing of the sort. Rather it shines a light on the burden placed on those who suffer from these serious conditions and the indifference in which they are treated by society. Arthur sums it up perfectly in the film when he says ""the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't"".Despite what critics and some who want to use the film as a political tool have said about the visceral and raw violence depicted on screen, Joker is not a film about violence. Rather, it is about our need as a society to be empathetic. One act of kindness could be everything to someone suffering in isolation. The violence we see on screen is essentially a metaphorical response to the brutal feelings of isolation that exist when one is inflicted with serious mental illness. Being trapped by your own mind with no escape can lead many people suffering from mental illness to commit acts of violence on themselves, even in a non literal sense, especially in the way they perceive themselves.If anyone's take away from the film is to highlight the violence we briefly see on screen, then they have failed to understand that the film is screaming at us that violence is not the answer to our problems. In fact, more abuse and violence is inflicted upon Arthur than anyone else in the film and it is through this affliction that we begin to see the world around him for what it truly is.Ever since the film was lauded with the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice Film Festival it has been met with controversy. Some have claimed that Joker leaves the viewer with a morally ambiguous message that will encourage incels, a trait recognised in Arthur, to commit murder.This is a predictable scaremongering media violence trope we have heard for decades about films by politicians and societal leaders to cover up their own failings that have led to the immoral and depraved society we inhabit today.Those reading this review may have been put off watching the Joker due to the subject matters under discussion, but this is why it is imperative that each and every one of us watches this film. By seeing the true depths of how our society can unintentionally or intentionally push ordinary people to the edge of insanity, maybe it will force us to reflect on our own expressions of compassion and empathy.",0
Joker,Absolutely breathtaking,"In short this film is absolutely incredible. Everything from the cinematography to the score is perfect. Phoenix is a revelation and is a definite Oscar contender.

Joker,Watch It!!!,"Alright, so this is my first review but I felt like I had to talk about it. I'm 14 years old and went to see this with my friend. Now, I consider myself quite mature for my age in terms of movies, so I knew that this wasn't gonna be the usual comic book movie but goddamn was this a pleasant surprise. Firstly, the acting in this movie is incredible, especially Joaquin Phoenix. The cinematography is also great and the music is phenomenal. I've read some criticism around the movie surrounding the fact that it borrows stuff from Taxi Driver and King of comedy. I can't comment on king of comedy as I have not seen it yet, but I have seen Taxi Driver so I can comment on that. I can see the influence, but I don't think it borrows that much from it. The basic plot setup is the same, but the execution is so different so I wouldn't compare the two. All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough.10/10 would forget the snacks I brought with me again1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,This movie is a masterpiece really gives an insight into the Jokers mind while remaining very emotional throughout this psychological thriller,"Let's just say Joaquin Phoenix has done a remarkable job as playing the Joker, where he really does make The Joker as disturbing as he is always meant to be. We first start off seeing Arthur Fleck (The Joker) working as a clown for this company that sends people dressed up as clowns to different places in the city to entertain customers. We learn from the start that Arthur has schizophrenia he was placed on a psychiatric mental hospital temporarily in the past, where now he is out trying to fit into society on seven different medications while seeing a councillor in the meantime to try and get better to feel something positive in his life. You feel sorry for his character through his descent into madness as you learn all the hardships that he has been through, like been beaten as a child to still being taken the mick out of and beaten while being disregarded as an adult, which makes me think he wants society, but society does not want him to exist with his horrible condition. You will find yourself on an emotional journey in this film really does bring The Joker into a humane light while also being Psychotic with the reasons behind that. He also reverts to like a mind palace when he is unsure or someone is being horrible to him, which it can be either thinking that he is somewhere or with a particular person when his not or his uncontrollable laughter that calms him down as it is kind on his go to defence mechanism with his schizophrenia to try to make himself feel calmer. When we see him dancing down the stairs it gives him a humane happy side showing that he is still a human not just a mad killing monster that we always have perceived him to be, therefore he really does need help when people just ignore him and cast him off as kind of a waste of space in society. Arthur does not know how to react to everyday situations is a struggle for him, so killing someone in defence to him if they have really wronged or mocked him is fair game, even though we feel anger inside in our everyday lives that can be relatable we know how to make sense of our feelings knowing right from wrong with certain levels, which Arthur with his condition he cannot really comprehend. Even though these rich guys are horrible people and are very mean to him, which we can see Arthur has a point to the fact that if someone like them been killed people would be out for blood, compared to if someone like him had been killed they would just be passed by and ignored like street rubbish, therefore something needs to be changed. Arthur as The Joker he is trying to invoke a movement against people who think less of him and are mean to him even though the way he is going about it is the completely wrong way to go about it. We see people are being killed on the streets as a result of his killings to force change, where a peaceful campaign could have been more a lot effective in the long run instead of just madness and chaos. Overall, I would give this film a ten out of ten I defiantly recommend you watching it really does play with your mind it is a psychological thriller that can be scary to have you on the edge of your seat, therefore well done to the phenomenal acting along with the cinematography that really sets the scene for the film. Just to bear in mind that this is a stand alone film based on DC Characters, so some of the plot of how it fits in does not make sense, however that is how it is meant to be portrayed to give the shocking reality that raises awareness about these issues as they are real life people with these mental problems that they should be helped not ignored by so many people.",0

Joker,Great Movie,"After watching the new Todd Phillip's movie ""Joker"", I think that this is a great movie about society and its aftermath, but as a film about the iconic DC comic book antagonist, it is rather empty because this is no joker pre-history, but rather an arbitrary director's way of attracting viewers to the cinema thanks to its intriguing title. Therefore, it should be viewed as a social drama, not a comic book screening.For those who want to know how this hero came about, I suggest you read ""The Killing Joke"" or at least watch a cartoon showing the birth of Joker.P.S.

He is grotesque, yes, horrible, yes, but soo humane, you really get to see his point of view and at the end..you kinda are glad that through all this bullshit he actually gets to be happy.

Joker,History of joker,"As a person who has watched almost all Hollywood, Bollywood, Japanese and Iranian movies
My opinion on this film is not superficial. So you can read my opinion carefully
I go through all the previous jokes and jokes.
Well, we're with the Joker side
In a very detailed and detailed way, Arthur is trying to cope with the heartless community that thinks everyone is a threat.
A society prone to inappropriate parenting, harsh self-hatred to strangers, and a lack of intimate communication with different strata of government.
In this kind of community that we have already witnessed in different countries
The creation of the joker will be quite natural
In fact, this is what we do:
We force, maltreat, humiliate, and label others
And if they react to jail, or send them to the sanatorium,
let's move on
Arthur in the moments before killing his mother
Feeling a mixture of hatred and complete failure of personality
Here is the joker born, the joker who is all of us, the equation is like this in my view of the joker
Joker = us
Unfortunately, this is happening every moment in the world
Something that will and will be the symbol of that joker
Next thing I would like to discuss is that: 1: Joker killings are not like gang killings or terrorism
2: The joker does not shoot his head in the middle of a victim's pleas
3: The Joker does not work with several hundred people
And most importantly: The Joker has a personal feeling about his victims
Because of money?
For the sake of family?
Is it because of politicians?
He just wants to prove if I did
You deal with Arthur from the poor to the rich, as in the film, the behavior of these two groups is similar to Arthur's.
And now I'll prove
Let me briefly refer to the Batman movie
Joker (Heath Ledger) tries to make people wise
Like Batman wearing pants to prove that everyone can be a joker just a spark.
This!
Let's go back to the modern Joker Arthur!
Well I'd like to suggest you if you've encountered a Joker in your life
The real joker will not steal from you or take away your gold watch
So before you die, where in your life did you unknowingly break the personality of a person who now has a Joker!
Anyway, I'll say one thing about the Joker: I'm sorry, for all the beautiful lies that were designed to keep society standing on the knees of innocent people.
In the end, instead of concluding, I want to convey to you the message of the Joker's personality
Hope it will be useful
Joker message:
You go out of your house in the morning with great clothes and say goodbye to your neighbors.
But you would give a poor person who's going to have your bag dropped off in the subway with a stylish robbery and slander.",0
Joker,Joker,"The Joker. Purchased those tickets expecting the return of Batman's most famous villain? Laughing whilst killing cops? Robbing banks? Burning down hospitals? Well prepare for quite a dissatisfying 120 minutes because this time, Joaquin Phoenix is not playing as the Joker we know, he's playing as someone much more than a maniac and representing something much more than lunacy.Joaquin Phoenix's superb acting and taunting yet victorious music by Hildur Gudnadottir go hand - in - hand and alas produces an almost disturbing and, at the same time, wonderful piece of art. But what enthralled me more is the film's embedded symbolism.Do try to decipher the meanings behind the film and not just merely watching it because by then, what is in our sight takes us away from what is not. How one decipher those meanings may differ, meanings are subjective, but do take notice on the common ground that we can all agree on. For the first time - or for the first time that we realise - the crazy mad clown killer represents the unfortunate, the underrepresented, the disabled, the labelled-as-unhinged...the people. Throughout the first half of the film, Joker is seen as an invalid that no one cares of. Then there is the Wayne who proclaims to be the cure for Gotham, the cure for the madness that people like him (the upper classes) have created, a satire to those who now rule, but never govern. Now watch as the clown that everyone laughs at becomes the person they have always needed, but never knew. In the end, the society's shadow rises as the symbol and the centre of a revolution, an upbringing of the left behind. For once, people realise that maybe they are no different from that clown, the clown that has had enough of the lies, ignorance, and the fake promises of the ruling classes that Wayne represents.One -- I hope -- can realise that this is no ordinary DC film, this is a story of a joke that is our society and a clown who has become weary of laughing.",0

Joker,Heartbreakingly Beautiful,Within 15 minutes I already had tears in my eyes. My heart was with the Joker from the beginning to the very end of this movie. Never before have I been so moved by such a seemingly evil character.Joaquin's performance is nothing other than a master piece. Flawless.What this movie teaches us about mental health and the failing system we all live in is incredibly eye opening.I can't wait to see this again and again.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0
Joker,Exceptional!! I am glad this movie exists..!!,"No CGI, No crappy humor, just raw human emotions portrayed in a manner that you can't look away and you can't stare at him for long, if you do he'll get you..
In a world oversaturated of ""funny"" comic book movies, the only serious one is about a clown
Marvel created an alien warlord villain with super powers by giving him an infinity gauntlet
DC made a human villain by just throwing him into the society taking away everything he had... funny how it works..!!Apparently the best super villain ever in this CGI dominated world is a skinny clown with no powers and being beaten by everyone.. that's dark, that's deep ..DC.. you have my attention!!A masterpiece and Phoenix has owned the movie completely. I have no frikking right to rate one such movie!Do you still wanna know how he got those (O)scars?",0
Joker,"all I can say is ""wow""","Joaquin Phoenix puts forward one of the best acting performances of our generation. I still watch the Dark Knight to this day for Heath Ledger's incredible performance. While it is certainly unfair to compare one's rendition to the other, I never thought I would see the Joker brought to life in as dynamic of a way as Ledger's Joker, but Phoenix certainly did so.
The movie is deeply disturbing and is an emotional roller-coaster. Without revealing spoilers, the movie is about a severely mentally ill man who is becoming more and more psychotic as society pushes him away and into madness.
The ending. I can't even put it into words. All I will say is this: when Phoenix goes full ""Joker"" at the end, I had goosebumps on my arms for minutes. When you watch the movie, you will know the exact moment I'm talking about.
For me, this was one of those movies that will be talked about for years to come.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Honest review,I knew this film was not your average comic film. I think it really does well delivering a political message and portraying mental illness in the film. Joaquin's performance was amazing. I believe the people in the theater with me expected this joker to be like the terrible Jared Leto one. Don't go to this movie expecting a ameature joker.

Joker,Joker- The Film of the Decade,"The basic difference in the movie-making styles of Hollywood and Bollywood is that while Bollywood is adept in making an inspiring tale like that of Anand Kumar to a comical, nonsense trash like Super 30, Hollywood makes a once in a generation movie from a DC comic book character and adds a gem like Joker in its treasure trove. The movie right from the word go grips you, gets into you, grows within you, questions your own sanity and does not leave you hours or days after the end credits have rolled. Backed by a tight screenplay, this latest offering from the director Tim Roth of the Hangover fame, this movie has a chilling undertone in each and every frame. Joker follows the basic theorems of movie-making. There are no unnecessary complications or ostensibly layered outlook, which makes this an edge of the seat thriller. The background score, especially in the transformation scenes, is scintillating. Many people have touted it as a tribute to the Scorsese style of film making. But to be true, barring the Departed, Scorsese never played it so simple in any of his movies. Joker in every sense is a path breaker. It won't be an overstatement to say that Roth has actually outshined another maverick filmmaker of this generation, the great Christopher Nolan in portraying the character of Joker, even though his movie on the same character has different premises.A commentary on this great tale will be incomplete without talking about its protagonist Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Legend says that he actually lived in the skin of this character for the last couple of years. His devotion, his sacrifice, his understanding of the character-everything is reflected in every single moment of this movie. This is something you don't believe can exist. He is so normal in portraying an insane, abnormal, complex character like Joker that you start believing as if it's happening for real. The pain the society inflicted on him, the fear of failure, and the depression of being a loser in life and finally liberating the inner pathos through his vendetta and seeking pleasure in bringing anarchy in the society- every emotion has been made visceral by the ace actor. If he does not get the Oscar for this, I think millions of movie lovers like me will lose faith in the credibility of the Academy Awards. Like Vivien Leigh of Gone With the Wind, Humphrey Bogart of Casablanca, Jack Nicholson of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Meryl Streep of Kramer Vs Kramer or Natalie Portman of Black Swan, Joaquin Phoenix will be remembered for the decades to come for his iconic portrayal of this iconoclastic character.
P.S- Phoenix makes Joker so real, you may start loving the negative shades. The real movie starts after this movie ends on the silver screen. Get ready to face the Joker in you.",0

Joker,Joker would be proud,"You should not listen to what anyone says, this movie is a mastepiece. Even now 5 hours after i watched the movie, i still get chills from all the moments in the film. The film does an excellent job at potraying arthurs life and his demise leading him to become the joker. This is not really a comic book movie, it is more a crime movie with certain elements of the batman lore that ties in (good) unexpected ways into the film. Now yes, this does have violence and some disturbing scenes but it is a R-rated film about the joker, if it did not, then the movie would be failure.

Joker,All it takes is one bad day...,"Ever since its debut at the Venice Film Festival, ""Joker"" has been considered a modern masterpiece by many people who watched it. Many were calling it a mixture of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy,"" which are both movies created by filmmaker Martin Scorsese. They were also giving a lot of praise to its lead, Joaquin Phoenix, saying it's possibly one of the most unsettling performances given by an actor in years. With all of these thoughts in mind entering the theater, I had some high hopes. I walked out with my expectations not met but surpassed.This movie is marvelous. When it comes to films and the way they tell stories, this is everything a film lover could hope for. Phoenix is mesmerizing in the role of Arthur Fleck, a very troubled man who is struggling to make sense of his life that eventually leads him to a path of crime. Though his character is awkward in his social interactions and time spent by himself, you can't help but feel sorry for this man who's just being beaten down by society every day. There is an Oscar buzz going around for his performance and it's totally warranted. Phoenix consumes the screen whenever he's on it, which is luckily the entire movieSince this film was based on the legendary comic book villain a lot of people were hoping for the moment Arthur Fleck transforms into the Joker to be a great feeling, but it wasn't a change the audience wants to root for. The filmmakers wisely made the decision to make the character not necessarily likable but understandable. One can understand why the Joker makes the decisions he does but the film doesn't glorify his decisions. When one watches his character arch throughout the movie, there is a sense of dread because you don't really want him to break mentally. This decision, however, makes this an excellent character study and cautionary tale.The other great aspect of the film is its pacing. This is definitely a slow-burning movie but it's never boring. Watching Arthur Fleck from where he was in the beginning to where he ends up is a complete 180 transformation.Throughout the movie, one can tell this man is just like a ticking time bomb, and when the boom explodes, no one will be safe.Todd Phillips, the director, also deserves a lot of praise. This is an amazingly shot and told story. This is by far his best film to date and that was my biggest concern going in. If the Joker was going to get his own feature film, it needed to be a very character-driven movie. The fact that Phillips' most character-driven film prior to this was ""The Hangover"" movies raised huge concerns. Not to disrespect that film, but it's not a high art film. However, Phillips has proven himself to be a director with amazing talent, and I can't wait to see his next project.Another amazing aspect is the cinematography. The color pallets and framing of this film really gets one into the tone of this depiction of Gotham City. Though this film has a dirty and cold exterior, it does have a solid heart at its core.As far as negatives go, I have only minor nitpicks. If anyone has seen the film ""Taxi Driver,"" they will know that a lot of ""Joker"" takes inspiration from that - at times a little too much. Sure, all stories borrow from other stories, and it's not to say that this movie isn't its own thing, but one can easily see that ""Joker"" has a kind of blueprint layout of that movie. There is also a song choice toward the beginning of the third act that I felt was a little cheesy. It was kind of a bigger moment in his transformation and it took me out of the moment a little.Other than that, this is a solid film with a relevant message in today's day and age. It can make one think of the thoughts going on in individuals one sits next to in class, walks past on the street, or sees eating in a restaurant. Who knows, all it takes is one bad day.",0
Joker,"A MASTERPIECE THAT COMES FROM A DARK PLACE, A SAD PLACE, THIS IS HIS OSCAR MOMENT","JOKER !!!! 2019 CINEMATIC RELEASEDC COMICSI BELIEVE THAT JACQUIN PHOENIX IS NOW THE REAL JOKER. HEATH LEDGER WAS AMAZING HOWEVER JACQUIN IS PHENOMENAL AND LEGENDARY.This film activates so much in your mind, about how this world is neglecting mental health and how they expect everyone to behave the same. Sometimes you cannot sitdown and explain things to people because people simply dont understand.
This film potrays that the constent meetings the constent talks that are useless and uncessary. He as an actor and his character makes you realize so much things and so much truth, because it happens in reality. If someone rich dies the world cries but if someone with an illness such as mentality dies in an alley way, the world does not care at all.This film is dark, powerful, and so disturbing. Jacquin Phoenix is going to win the oscar for this and if he does not then he is robbed.

I felt this was the one.This kind of approach to one of the most notorious comics character is so welldone that I question myself why there isn't more of this.Arthur Fleck made me feel a lot of emotions while watching his ordinary life, which is so unfair it hurts, and that has a lot to do with Joaquin Phoenix Oscar-worthy performance.There were a lot of scenes that made me quite disturbed, but for me, the most heartbreaking scene is the one when Arthur is on the bus and is told to stop bothering the kid in front of him. His reaction is so believeble, so perfect that shows how good actor Phoenix really is.This movie deserves, without a doubt, the praise that is receiving.

Joker,Most Intense Movie Of The 2000s,"Joaquin Phoenix's descent into the abyss of being 'The Joker' is the most compelling single achievement of an actor of this young century - and 'Yes', I'm rating it higher than Heath Ledgers 'thought-to-be' immortal performance.You ask 'Why?'Because I'm certain that this movie will change this society's perspective on mental illness (it kinda already has), disorders and the state of this f'd up society in general. For too long the bottom half was forcefed with plastic TV, irrevelant news to keep them tranquilized and under the lid of our 'so-shiny-perfect-life' where the amount of IG-followers decides over your importance to society.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is a MILESTONE of method acting, a bloodchilling hard-to-watch experience of pain and suffering, an indefinite ride through the pain of a single human being looking for the most human thing there is - love.'Joker' is a sure award-lock in every meaningful competition this year (Actor, Film, Director, Score, Camera, Screenplay, Script) and Phillips propelled himself into 'take-all-our-money-and-do-what-you-want'-territory from now on.See it before it catches you, I'll definitely see it at least once more because 'All I Have Are Negative Thoughts'.MASTERPIECE!",0

Joker,"It's brilliance, swop critic's head - It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be","I usually write reviews on amazing movie experiences or if my perception of the movie is the opposite of the so called critics.This time is both!I don't think I need to point out anything for Joaquin's performance, Oscar worthy, brilliant, at the same level as Heath, even though the comparison is really inglorious, since this is a standalone movieNow for the movie itself, above all, I believe it conveys a really strong message which most of us would like to ignore, which is the suffering and complications with intense mental disorders.
I am not an American national, but I've been there several times, and I strongly believe that not only, there is still a heavy stereotype for this individuals, but also, given the current social/economic reality, not enough has been done for those who carry this traumas.And while the movie explores this, it doesn't compromise the infamous villain story, it actually brings a wider perspective on his motives and behavior, and how he reached the downward spiral we all witnessed in the Dark KnightI am also not a fan of a specific component of the story line, which they used to cause more impact, I won't spoil it, let's just say they could have used any other character to convey the exact same message.Aside from that, overall it's an intense, dark, bold movie, which contrary to critics mention of bringing nothing new, it actually does.
No it's not a ripoff of Taxi Driver, inspired? Maybe, but if you indeed compare it, I actually believe Joker provides even more in depth to the psychology of the character as well as way more context.It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be",0

Joker,One of the greatest films,"'We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off'This dialogue from the movie FIGHT CLUB justifies JOKER movie and what i realized is a good childhood is so important for a person to cheer n be happy when he is in his/her 20s and 30s that's the age where we have to do a lot of hard work in our lives and become successful, but sometimes somethings go wrong and it makes you unhappy and depressed so at that moment you think of your childhood memories and if they make you happy then it will definitely give you the hope and you get up again n again but if it haunts you it's the real disaster and then you start doubting yourself which leads to depression and then everything seems so awful that you turn into a person who doesn't care about the society and start doing things without restricting yourself from the small line of right and wrong, you don't care about the consequences, now whether it is right or wrong that's debatable, but JOKER movie tells each n every person that 'see you always wanted to react in this way when someone was cruel with you but you never did' so that's so relatable about this film to each n every person in this world...

It couldn't be further from the truth. This hands down is a masterpiece. It's dark, mysterious and disturbing. It's brilliant and its down to the performance of one man..Joaquin Phoenix.It's unusual that a film that deals with the darkness of mental health issues makes you walk out with your mind blown, wanting more. This is because Phoenix takes you with him, deep in his conscience, you want to feel empathy, you cheer him.This is not a normal DC superhero film. It's more anti-hero.

Joker,"I watched this masterful thriller last weekend, and I've decided to make an IMDb account to show my appreciation for it as much as I can (also this review is spoiler free).","Gotham is a decaying and depressing city with Arthur trying to be a ray of sunshine in the darkness (he works as a clown for an entertainment company), but he is repeatedly mistreated and largely ignored by society, making him become increasingly aggressive even towards those he loves. He eventually becomes an icon of rebellion as he starts to become more and more relentless, eventually craving his newfound attention and fully embracing it. Many thought the character of this iconic villain was tainted by Jared Leto's performance in Suicide Squad, but this fully compensated it, Heath Ledger sure as hell would be glad about this. This film proves that sometimes it's lengthy character development that makes a better film than frequent action sequences and CGI. So by all means, believe me when I say that the hype is deserved, it's well worth your time ;).1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Joker.....the hero?,"After paying 600pkr (¬£3.30) for a ticket I went into it thinking 9/10 IMDB pffft yeah right, like I've watched so many good films it's gotta be absolutely amazing for it to be added to that list because I just didn't know how they would pull it off and that aswell with no like build up such as a batman film before, not in the DCEU or anything else it was just a stand alone movieThen whilst watching it, it was so unpredictable that I was just constantly thinking wtf why am I enjoying this so much then I realised his acting (and the score omffgggg) just takes you on a rollercoaster that by the end of it your on his side and cheering him on like he's the heroThere where 1 or 2 bits I didn't like but overall one of the best movies I've seenIn my opinion",0
Joker,A great and unnerving story powered by Joaquin Phoenix's flawless performance.,"6 out of 5.What are you expecting? Mark Hamill's Joker? Heath Ledger maybe? Jared Leto before he went to a punk rock bar or maybe Jack Nicholson and Tim Burton? Let me offer you one word advice. Go in without expectations. The movie is far more darker than Tim Burton can imagine and more mentally disturbed than Ledger's protrayal.In this movie there is no dramatic music pounding in the background. There is no superhero. Honestly, you can drop the entire Joker/Batman thing and still have a movie that is truly a masterpiece. What there is, is a great and unnerving story powered by Joaquin Phoenix's flawless performance. He commanded every scene with the skill unmatched by anyone I have seen in a long time.Do yourself a favor. Drop your expectations. Forget about Batman. Go to the movies and watch this in the dark. Oh yeah, hit the bathroom before you go in. You won't want to get up for any reason.",0
Joker,Don't listen to the Fake media or the critics.,"Truly captivating, however the Critics and Media still want to make this movie/character look terrible to push their own agendas. Meanwhile there is a real lesson behind it. Society is twisted and wants to make those who aren't in their mindset look crazy or ""weird"". 10/10 movie.

Joker,"A brilliant masterpiece, but I understand why it's difficult to watch.","My second review in IMDB. I went to watch this film for a second time and I'm considering a third. I have never, and I mean, NEVER, wanted to go back and watch a movie again and again. As other commenters - I admit that I also understand why the movie causes division. I understand the political views, I understand that many shooting victim relatives are worried this could somehow spark an individual with the desire to shoot, to really do it, I understand the movie TALKS openly about mental illness. I am so sorry to all victims. But you should understand that this movie is not MEANT to empathize Arthur through allowing yourself to justify his actions. He is a broken man, he was abused to the point he lost his way. People get all kinds of bullying and a lot of people survive though it, yet a lot of them don't. They either end it or they turn into the darker side - a coping mechanisms, sick mechanism. But this IS the human. It is complex, it is an endless encyclopedia and I think it is of a great importance to show this. Maybe the word you're searching for is heartbreaking. We see a man who could have survived through the bullying, but instead he gave himself to the demons, because of constant social suppression merged with the mental illness he already had. It is how it is. Should we ignore it? Should we slam it just because it's political, or because it's showing guns, or because it touches the topic of mental illness, or anything else that sparks controversy? No... Yes, these topics are complex, it's not news, it is the hardest things to talk about, but I think it's bold and brave to make this film and I appreciate the whole cast and crew for making it. This film shows all of it, all raw from the human soul. And what makes it good is, as our screenwriting lecturer in our film course explains, we show a complex character, which does bad things, but we understand why he/she does them. We are not MEANT to sympathise, empathize, but UNDERSTAND why they did what they did.I am sorry for those who find it dark or too involved in these topics. But I think it's extremely important for this movie to be here, to teach about things they don't tell us in school, but also to provoke yourself, to see what you should never turn into. This movie is NOT urging people to become criminals. No, no, no, no, no. It's supposed to make you sick, it's supposed to make you want to leave the room, because you don't want to ever end up in this situation. Because we understand how horrible all of this is. Unfortunately, not all people will understand this movie. And this is where all the negativity comes from. As I said, I understand the so many relatives, friends, acquaintances of people who have died in similar scenarios, I understand why they are worried. We don't know who is watching this movie, we don't know what is going through their head. And unfortunately, it may cause a spark in them. But if this movie is not out, we never see it. We never understand. We never are aware, we don't have the proper knowledge of it. Because me knowing more about mental illness teaches me how to protect, how to react, how to preserve. It teaches me to treat people right, to be there for them, to NEVER do them wrong. And trust me, one person is not a lot, but it is something and it could save a soul.It is a difficult film, but it was shown flawlessly.",0
Joker,Had to see it twice due to the brilliance of the entire thing.,"Wow. Believe it or not, it was even better the second time i saw it, because i knew the story and could look for things. I thought I would be able to better understand what is 'real', and what is not the second time, however the writing is so brilliant that you just do not know. We have not seen many movies like this over the past 20 years, and this will be iconic for a long time. Possibly the movie of the generation. I cannot support this film enough. It should win pretty much every major oscar award, including score of all things. Simply wow.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,The True Meaning of A Masterpiece,"Been hyping Joker for the past 5 months (since the teaser trailer dropped) and it really lived up the expectation. If not, it felt better than any expectations out there.When I watched the teaser, I know this movie will be that kind of movie that gets stuck in your head until you're no longer breathing air. It's solid, beautiful, disturbing, funny, and extremely memorable.I love every second of it.It's a no surprise that Joaquin Phoenix outdo himself (again) in this role. He has caught every essence of Arthur Fleck and executed it as uniquely possible.Todd Phillips's direction was light but beyond meaningful. He helped Phoenix perfected his storytelling and it matched every main aspects of filmography; music, cinematography, editing, script, and of course acting.The score from Hildur Gudnadottir was also an excellent match for the whole film. It's haunting, intimate, personal, daring, and unsettling. Her music really molded the film's soul from the very first scene. Just beautiful.Watched it (so far) for three times. And I was in heavenly experience for three times. Go. Watch. It.Wrote my first watch review on my blog fadhilasupriana.blogspot.com go check it out!",0
Joker,The best performance I have ever witnessed on screen,"Like all great movies, I need a few hours after the first viewing to absorb, and reflect. I'm talking about Joker. This is spoiler free, don't worry.It's a rare thing to go into a film that lives up the the hype. Well, this one surpasses it. The story itself, we've seen kind of before, a person who's just been pushed too far, but here it's different, it's not a guy breaking bad, it's the story of a man who from the outset is disturbed to his very core, a man already gone over the edge, he's literally fallen so far, he's landed where he fell off.His descent into further madness is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is not borderline genius, it's more than genius, every minute he's on screen, there is minor changes in his character that has to be surpassed from the previous minute. I have to wonder what his sanity is like after wrapping up. From the contortions of his emaciated body, to the expressions of absolute mental torture during his maniacal laughter. He is glorious, and I have never seen any actor give a performance like this. You know you should be appalled by his actions, but you cannot help but feel sorry for such a tortured character. Forget about the Oscar, he should get every conceivable award this year for this performance.This leads me to Director Todd Phillips, he does a masterful job in tying everything together, but I can't go into that too much as it will lead to spoilers. The mood of a frustrated and explosive Gotham City is depressing as the mood of the world we live in now.The soundtrack is great, some fantastic tracks from the time period as well as some really very haunting tunes from the same artist who worked on Chernobyl, The Handmaids Tale and The Reverend, ok I had to check IMDB but if your a fan of those shows and movie, you'll know what I mean, Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir is her name and it's now on my phone, and I'm listening as I type.Everything about this movie is perfect and a real joy for a fan of the Bat, and yes there is tons of connections. Check out Bruce's treehouse, a wonderful blink and you'll miss homage to the 60's Batman tv show.a rare hyped movie that will have a cult following forever.

Joker,Great and deep!,"It's amazing how the film sequence goes so well, the great director's work makes you put into joker's life and how he sees the society and the world. This couldn't be possible without Phoenix's performance, its an amazing job than I haven't seen in a while. This movie can makes you feel sad at the end because you can understand a little part of how this kind of psychiatric persons may feel, and how the society ignore them.

Joker,Deserves all the Oscars.,"Now, I must say even hearing about the film and seeing the trailer, I actually wasn't looking forward to this film .. it was only till my friends had seen it and came back raving with so much hype I had to go see what all the fuss was about.And let me tell you it was worth ALL THE HYPE! Truly one of the best films of the year if not THE best, I was gripped throughout, literally the movie has every element of your emotions, it's a crazy whirlwind and thanks to the acting it really makes some parts feel real. You will leave that cinema dissecting every part of the film, your brain won't stop thinking about it for days.Joaquin was truly magnificent and cannot be faulted, the best acting I've seen in a while. This movie is definitely worth a watch even if you don't fancy it from the trailer. See it for yourself. Be focused and enjoy this crazy wonderful film.The best Joker yet. Give it all the Oscars!",0

Joker,Delightfully disturbed,"As a frequent movie goer and fellow performer I would just like to say first off I am thoroughly impressed. The entirety of this film was extremely depressing. Any sliver of happiness that Arthur gets, seems to just get extracted viciously out of his life. You watch his slow decent into madness and you're clenching onto your seat to see what he might do next; whether that is killing ruthlessly, or creating fake relationships in his twisted mind. Joaquin Phoenix depicts the perfect battle between good and evil with his constant struggle between happiness and sadness. In the end I was honestly routing for the joker because of the pain manifested through his whole life. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me see things differently about society. Everyone is a little mad. 10/101 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Todd Phillips' Joker might be bringing cinema to a new era.,"Far from a superhero flick,the name of the Joker managed to bring again to the cinema theaters all kinds of people,showing the effect good cinema can have as a collective experience.Good cinema appeals to everyone,not only cinephiles and Phillip's Joker is the proof.A film with no effects,no thriller elements,of not more than one character,with no car chases,no superhero costumes manages to be just mesmerising for a mere 2 hours.That is mainly due to Joaquin Phoenix.Cinematography is beautiful just as the direction,but the film lives through Phoenix who is haunting.A film that maybe shows that we as an audience might had been getting it wrong all along just as the studios might had miscalculated what we really like in the first place.Just like references as Taxi Driver were creating havoc upon their release,maybe the Joker will bring again the cinema to a new golden era,giving blockbusters a new different meaning.As for the social commentary,I will not comment on the nonsense.I will just say that what the film is accused for couldn't be further from the truth.There is a message.That's that we should think again of all the times we turned our back to people in need,all the times we laughed at them and all the times we didnt give a helping hand when they were so desperately trying to reach out.Maybe Joker can make us better,only for a while.I'm just stunned.",0

Joker,What's the joke? You won't get it.,"These last dialogues from the film predicted what many critics and viewers will be faced with. Upon reading several reviews and listening to the constroversy surrounding this movie, I was somewhat skeptical that may be this movie just pushed the right hot buttons ideologically/politically, and that would be it, nothing more. But not only Joker mirrored the real life themes of mental health, poverty and elitism, but also managed to be a solid origin movie of a comic book villain. This movie neither inspires violence or glorifies incel like behavior as media is falsely suggesting, it puts the main character in the spot light from the beginning on how mentally unstable and unsettling his behavior is. I don't think this movie even sympathize with the joker to even make his rationals (if there are any) or actions justifiable, but instead it only presents a bleak picture of society where such people are ticking timebomb, and without the help they need, they are destined to have a similar (but not as theatrical as Joker's) fate. This movie is sometimes disturbing in it's plot points, and Jeaquin Phoenix's performance is crazy good and very unsettling, even in the society that is represented, but to say either this is a movie about a sane actor in an insane world or a sane character in an insane world would be injustice. This movie is about the insanity coming it terms with it, and realizing the world is just as insane. The Joke is truly on us, and only reason we are laughing because we are in constant pain just like the Joker.",0

Joker,Masterful study of the descent into evil,In a beautiful character study of a man that society has neglected. Great film.

Joker,Best Joker ever.,"Before I saw the movie I saw the bad reviews by self-proclaimed movie critics but i still wanted to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. The narrative has great depth as well as the actors, especially Joaquin Phoenix. The music and sceneries fit so well that it catapults you right into the time and place. There's so much I could say about this movie but I don't wanna spoil anything.This movie has once again proven how important it is to find things out for yourself and not listen to others, especially not critics who's job is to create awareness for their publication. I truly hope Joker will continue with this cast and formula.10/10 for Joker.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,"Brilliance, Artistic, Spectacular","From Phoenix's brilliant performance to the story itself, this movie delivers an astonishing dark origin tale of one of the most infamous villains in comic book history. It will make you laugh, perhaps cry, feel sorry and pain, anger and accomplishment as it is one of the BEST movies in cinema history. Personally I didn't have much expectations to avoid disappointment, but this movie succeeded in catching my attention and love from beginning to end. I watched it the day it came out and I'm still amazed by how it touched me. Heath is surely proud of Phoenix's role watching from up there.

Joker,From beginning to end - one of the best DC movies and one of the best movies overall I have seen,"From start to finish this movie gripped me, the direction, pace, acting, production, costumes, dialogue.... done to PER-FLECK-TION!! (See what I done there)Brutal yet honest this depiction of the Joker has left me wondering ""if this was by far the best portrayal of the joker, who could possibly do better?"" - well I asked the same thing with Heath Ledger's Joker and it looks like I have my final answer. This was deep and it felt like there was an underlining message about mental health issues and our governments blind eye turning that leads to the final result.This film is worthy of an Oscar in all departments especially for Joaquin Phoenix. Please dont take my word for it, go and see this movie as soon as. I feel a renewed faith in DC IF they go along a similar path as they have with this.How have some critics played this movie down so much is beyond me!",0

Joker,Finally a movie we deserve!,"Joker will draw you into his madness and sociopathy that will make you question everything. Todd and Joaquin bring us a masterpiece of human nature and how person is shaped by events that are happening to them.Joker is a dramatic piece that will be understood by regular people and seen in grey areas and not only black and white. It's about human tortures and dramatic events that happen all around us but we pretend like everything is fine. Joker dives deep into dark teritories and pushes boundaries with extreme violence but shows us why is everything happening and how our protagonist is dealing with information given to him. Arthur Fleck is a disturbed man which is evident from beginning but as story goes you find to learn more about him and how he is only trying to find its way in the crazy world.There are multiple possibilites for someone if they pursue them, they might not be the best but Arthur chooses one that he feels most comfortable with and his sense of comedy and darkness is unique but who are we to put his hopes and dreams down. Joaquin's commitmend to role is extraordinary, he pushes boundaries with his dedication for characters place and feelings. It is absolutely magnificent to watch him present us Arthur in all his colors and shades as he is mesmerasing, deceving and twisted.Todd moving from his regular comedy type movies and going full drama, choosing Joker (DC comics based character) and putting him in real world with real people insted of fictional universe is praise worth and him developing such a intriguing story that will feel like you are watching some regular drama inspired by time and day we live in. We live in sick and hard times but we choose to fight and overcome everything but there will always be other ones that are not capable of doing it and it will make them mad. Insted seeing this movie as movie that can make people do bad things it should make them see that bad things are not acceptable and how they make things dark and chaotic. and will always end in personal destruction.Directing and writing of Joker is marvellous from every point, it may not be the smart as some movies but it is captivating and makes you wonder all the time how things are going to happen and how they might have happened. Todd may have started his new path into greater film making and it will be interesting to see what he has to offer in the upcoming years.Dark, twisted and magnificent are the best words to describe the movie. 10/10",0

Joker,Cinematic Classic! Heath Ledger would be Proud of This.,"This is an incredible achievement. It has the much needed depth for modern day movies and is equally gripping. The origin of Joker is as poignant as the origin of Batman himself. The seemingly unsmiling Batman who wants order does need, and indeed does depend on the equally mighty force of laughter and chaos that comes to be the Joker. The descent into disorder, the hatred of the successful, etc. is all seamless. I am truly glad that this movie held on to its darker tones as it is, after all, a dark Batman and Joker story. Order and Chaos. Bring it on. I do sincerely hope that they continue with this storyline and we see more of this intense stuff. 10/10 from me. Not 9.

Joker,A Movie You'll Feel Honoured to Watch,"Phenomenal is the first word that comes to mind.It's rare to see so much talent in one movie. The style of direction pulls you right in to the dark world of Gotham city. It's psychological, it's gloomy and it's crazy, oh yeah. Without spoiling anything, some events in the movie are sure to hit you hard.The music is just perfect and makes the whole film smooth and much more effective. However, the best part of the movie is the actors. Every single character in the movie is portrayed so well, you'll need to remind yourself several times that you're watching a film. You'll find yourself doing a self sanity-check after watching the movie!Ultimately, there's Joaquin Phoenix. One thing I can tell you is that he deserves all the hype and more. The acting is at the next level. In my entire life, I've never felt so painful hearing someone laugh. The laughter, the dance, makeup, behavior and the personality, you will know no better ""Joker"". Joaquin DEFINES what this film meant to be.Anything less than 10/10 will be an insult to this masterpiece. If you don't carry a hatred towards psychological movies, definitely go check it out :)",0

Joker,A truly sensational depiction.,"Joker is a truly sensational dive into the back story of the Joker. A twisted look into his dark descent on the road to becoming the Joker. The character development is sublime with Pheonix playing an absolutely incredible version of the joker, matching his twisted insanity with scarily accurate acting. This is the back story the Joker really needed, away from all the CGI rubbish, and in with deep and dark story telling that keeps you on the edge of your seat! I also love the way a young Bruce Wayne was introduced, leading to the excitement of a potential sequel or appearance in the next Batman movie. The ending was also very very good and depicts how he became a legend amongst Gothams darkest.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A Gritty.realistic and amazing movie,"Best movie released this year and one of the best comic book movie ever made challenged only by The Dark Knight. Absolutely amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.He has portrayed the character so brilliantly,somehow evoking our sympathy for a psychotic homicidal clown. Todd Philips and Phoenix somehow makes us feel sad of the Joker but also makes us scared of him. The movie has an uncomfortable feel to it with amazing cinematography and a beautiful score. Every time the score starts to play you know somethings about to happen but you don't know what. The ending is amazing and somehow makes you feel satisfied but also uncomfortable that you feel that way.

Joker,"The Joker Has Arrived, And Its Brilliant!","It has took a 100 years for cinema to be where it is now and if Joker is any insight into this era of film, it's looking good. Firstly, Joaquin's chilling and haunting portrayal of a man trying to live his life while being broken at every chance in his life and every person possible is brilliant. The exploration of mental health not only by the writer but by the leads superb slowly dying eyes, his shallow and piercing laugh and his physicality being broken down into a skeletal structure laced with skin. This performance is amazing and as you walk out of that cinema room you will sit down and think ""That is what the movies are made for."" Although seen from teared filled eyes, the performance by all the cast and especially Phoenix and De Niro's performance as Arthur and Murray are some of the best in history with haunting and chilling moments that make you question who the good guy here is.
I love superhero films and i have very high standards when film making is experimenting with these established characters but my words are lost to the element of fulfilment i am at. The FLAWLESS script packs a punch with turns of emotion and surprise every second and it is a great way to use your time on this Earth and sit back and SMILE!. I wrote this 30 minuets after seeing this film and i am still overwhelmed but i can only leave you on 3 points:Leave this film as a solo outing and we can all be happy...You will never get another chance to see this in cinema so GO NOW!!Bring On The Clowns!DC have had a rough outing lately but this film has improved and adjusted what i fought was good cinema and i feel if you enjoy the art of film making, this film is a must see. 10/10.",0

The movie is intense and touches a lot of important topics: battle with mental illnesses, the war between the rich and the poor, injustice, lack of empathy, etc. When life is so bad that the villain becomes the hero and a leader of a movement.

Joker,A terrifying masterpiece,"Probably the best acting performance ever. And I don't say that lightly.
I don't remember the last time I watched a film and delved so deeply into the mind of the main character. It's scary, depressing at times.. but a shockingly real mirror on western society. From the smallest details in scenes, the viewer can abstract and pull real life experiences.
It takes the viewer so deep inside the mind of an indivudual who is confused on his reality vs consensus reality. We are taken on a journey of realisations, discovery of past trauma and floor shattering, life changing discoveries that even makes the viewer question their reality, their past and their capacity to fall into a confused state of mind. Once Patrick's floor of reality is taken from below him, he doesn't know how to react, his worldview is flipped and he is thrown into a freefall of madness. You as the viewer go there with him and the acting performance is so brilliant, you really feel all his anxieties and confusion of reality transferred onto you.A depressing film, I left the cinema is desperate need of positive thoughts.
However.. as one of the most important films of the decade I believe this film should be inspected and thought deeply about the problems in our society.",0

Joker,On par with Heath Ledger's iconic role in Dark Knight.,"I was blown away by the acting skills of Joaquin Phoenix. As the movie moves forward you start to emerge in the movie, more and more every second. The movie tries to get you really interested in the tragedy of Arthur Fleck likes it's smoothly going up like a roller coaster but when it hits, it hits like a car crash you are completely devastated by shocks and thrills that are delivered by the movie. I never thought that anyone would be able to portray the character of Joker as finely did by Heath Ledger but Man o Man this is just a complete another level. The movie has dark humor, it is tragic but it makes your ideology struggle for if what Arthur did was right or wrong. If you haven't watched this movie you are missing a milestone of acting set by Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is another level of awesome at another level of darkness. If you thought Joker was twisted you will come to know in this movie that people are more twisted.

Joker,2019's Masterpiece,"Simple as that. Joker is a masterpiece. As a character driven origin film, this is the quintessential DC movie.As a film, Joker is incredible to behold. It almost feels like an honour watching some of the best cinematography and directing of this year come alive right before your eyes. Each shot is like a painting perfectly making use of the 80's athsetic.Joaquin Phoenix puts in a career best performance, equalling and some times surpassing Ledgers take in 'The Dark Knight'. The supporting cast around him is fantastic too from De Niro as the Gotham talk show host to Zeze Beetz as Arthurs Flecks love interest and neighbor.Joker is one of the best films of 2019 and extremely important now more than ever with its realistic take on how mental illness affects us and the people around us. I cant say enough how this film is A MASTERPIECE!",0
Joker,It was a journey!,"I'm literally home lying down trying to digest what I just saw. This movie was a masterpiece. It definitely requires more than one viewing to truly appreciate and understand the masterful work. This was my first viewing so I'll hold off on throwing out any ratings etc, but let me tell you this: it was a journey! It was honestly the little things that I was able to notice that really convinced me of Joaquin's performance. And his ability to just throw that laugh out there off and on cue was insane. This movie is truly something special!
Phoenix did an excellent job capturing the essence of the character in his performance.
I actually understood the protagonist, his inner battles, his journey. It was Genius, pure genius. It was in my opinion hauntingly excellent, and executed with great precision.
They basically just made this portrayal more realistic. Although it wasn't comic accurate (which it wasn't meant to be), I was happy to see Joker go off and be his true maniacal self. In other words, that R rating did wonders for his character. Much like Logan!
My only issue with it is the fact that they made this masterful piece to just be a one off. Why can't they make a cinematic universe built like this? Just like the MCU.",0
Joker,An afterthought from the time Hollywood still made truly great films,"I normally would cringe at the thought of giving any film a 10 rating, no movie is perfect and I guess this isn't either, but for me I suppose this gets pushed from a 9 to a 10 just for being the type of film that Hollywood just doesn't make anymore.This movie takes one of comic's most famous mad clowns and takes you with him on the soul destroying journey of how he became Joker. Don't listen to the online loonies, this movie won't make you attack anyone, it will however make you think about mental illness and the people who suffer in silence. As well as the general, but basic, concept of kindness to others.On this journey, though you often vehemently disagree with joker's actions, you're nonetheless compelled to understand those choices. Phoenix and Phillips don't just deserve Oscars for this, what they've created essentially amounts to a treatise on the more tragic side of the human condition",0

Joker,What a performance! 5 days later and I'm still thinking about it.,"First and foremost i loath todays marvel and DC movies for being so over the top and for being cheesier that an Olympic size swimming pool filled with C√®so. Okay i will admit i liked guardians of the galaxy and avengers end game but that is it. But i can go see a million movies like this one if they had the same feel and performance as Joker did. It was so gritty and realistic i felt apart of that world, the cinematography was so good it was like fine art. And speaking of fine art Joaquin Phoenix needs to win an Oscar for his magnificent and believable performance i was awestruck threw out the entirety of the film at this man commitment to his his art. He has risen out of the fire and has become the joker. I have no other joker now he is the joker. Yes heath and jack are still great jokers but neither of them to it to level of Phoenix diving deep into the man himself. The director is also a genius the plot was relevant and impactful, the twist and turns were cleverly hidden, he was true yet unique the the joker universe. I have heard some critics say it had no message or meaning if this is true then why are we still taking about this movie days later and not just asking if you have seen it but really having deep conversations about it? I find myself still contemplating the film and will go watch it a 4th time this week cause I am not yet satisfied my quench has not yet been satisfied i need more. Go watch this film and forget about the sjw critics and media the are destroying their own art",0

Joker,Send in the Clown,"This is what I was expecting. Not a lot of people would appreciate Joker but in of its glory Joker talks about how cruel society has become in this day and age. Mental Illness is a serious concern and we as a society need to tackle it headon. Issues like Child Abuse, Mental Illness, Murder and Criminal Prejudice are the core of this movie. Anyone who goes in expecting a comic book movie is mistaken. You can't compare Joker to any other CBM it's a depiction of the character in real life. It's one of those rare stories where the villain wins and we see it from his perspective.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,A perfect origin to a perfect villain,"I dont understand the hate. I was very excited for this movie, then I read some reviews saying that it isnt actually good. But why? I saw one review where s/he literally wrote that s/he wanted to see a villain killing for no reason. Is that how a story works? If someone is a psycho. There has to be some reason and proper explanation about what he is doing or why he is doing. Killing people without any reason doesnt bring any character arc to the character. I think Phoenix nailed it as the Joker. His acting was perfect. If we talk about Cinematography, then its pretty notched up. The violence and action in this movie isnt high like any other superhero movie. But I think thats what make this movie more realistic and relatable to the real world. I am a die hard marvel fan, and I loved this movie. Music score is top notched, you would have heard it in the teaser trailer. His laughs really shows someone with suffering nd pain. The best thing I observe about this movie is that its well placed. The scenes have been deleted and cut in a proper manner, to give the exact runtime that a plot like this should have. It just didnt feel stretched. I lob",0
Joker,"If ever Heath Ledger is reborn as Joker, it would be like Joaquin Phoenix","A ride that makes us feel connected. A journey that leaves a beautiful flavor of acting for long time. I should Thank Todd Phillips for imagining in a sensible way for portraying a perfect character. There are several edge of the seat moments and several jump out of shock moments. On the whole movie makes us to a roller coster of emotions played by just one MAN. I went with an open mind and came back with a heavy heart. I didnt see what's coming. Yes, Joaquin deserves an Oscar and it's a gunshot decision. Really tough to make an expression in a convincing manner that is either a laugh or condition or just sad or cry.

Joker,A realistic view into a villains uprising - finally !,"Before I touch upon the content of the movie , I have to say the vibe it creates is like a Taxi Driver of the modern age with super villain in the making overtones ; which is funny because Deniro is in the joker , I wonder if the director did this purposefully ?Anyways , this movie was an amalgamation of emotions stirred up for a person I didn't think I ever cared for , aside from being a badass in a previous portrayal by Heath. Let's put this to rest right now ; Joaquin's Joker was so real to the point that I connected on a more personal level (than previous jokers including heaths) and I can see authenticity in this joker being THE joker that eventually faces off with Bats - even in this ""depressing"" formative period of his .... despite being exposed to an action packed super intelligent Heath Joker years before this .The feeling of powerlessness and a world against you is really what gets you down through your first 40 minutes or so in the movie but it's not a depressingly down feeling it's more of a contemplatively-down feeling for Arthur's condition and his situation in life . Essentially , it's hard to NOT feel for Arthur as opposed to what previous movies would conjure up in us for the joker - which always painted him as a one sided villain as opposed to the complex more than human Joker we see in this film.Overall the scenes were shot so well I felt like I was watching an old movie, which also helped complete the feeling of taxi driver (also that revolver Joker gets seems like a snubbed version of it), but also gave the setting of the film a perfect alibi - this WAS INDEED the time before Batman ; and we can tell from the scenery , the outfits and the props ... very well done. I feel although there's no promise of a sequel , the director and cast HAS to deliver a sequel - as the roller coaster ride of this journey has just begun and they really pulled the tempo of the film off correctly as to really entice us to be hungry for more screen time of Arthur In his very earliest joker years .If I could , I would see this made into a tv series as it seems so realistic with the way it displayed this joker , and the action was spread out enough to create suspense and many other emotions . If this was done I would expect them to cast Joaquin , due to his great performance , or at least someone that can emulate his exact performance and demeanor - as this was a performance I didn't expect to ""attract"" me so much as it did .Great film , 10/10 for me - if it weren't for the critics mindlessly bashing this title I wouldn't have written this review , but I feel like this is something we need to speak up about because everyone seeing this film either really likes it or LOVES it - BESIDES the critics ... hmmm I wonder why ? Maybe it has something to do with the AGENDA of those that wish to push a specific NARRATIVE for their platform? Look that's fine and all but please be a bit more transparent with your bias if you choose to run a review website .Compare the critics to the user reviews , how many of each one and you will see who the liars are and who is telling the truth about the movie . Everythings an ""opinion"" they will say after slanging dirt in an untruthful review ... ok that's fine but don't go bashing something that was shot , edited , directed , and written WELL and try to pretend like it's just some unbiased opinion, we can see through that !I, like thousands of others , went into the film UNBIASED and loved it , do the same and you will too ; go in there thinking the movie will have your incel neighbor boy kill you , you will leave there confused just to go on your critic profile on meta critic and bash for no reason and that will guarantee you have a bad time under the guise of social semantics .",0

Joker,Instant Timeless Classic Masterpiece. Unbelievable!,"First review I've ever felt compelled to write for a film...This film definitely lived up to the hype surrounding it and more!
After seeing Phoenix had been cast for the role, I was extremely excited as I've been a huge fan of his acting since his portrayal of Johnny Cash in Walk The Line. Never the less, I, like so many others was slightly sceptical that he may not live up to Heath Ledger's Joker but wanted to reserve judgement until seeing the film.
How wrong I was to have any scepticism. Phoenix's performance is for me the best acting I have ever seen in any film. Ever! I could not take my eyes off him on the screen in the cinema.
The film itself was much darker than I was expecting which I found really refreshing - tacking the issues surrounding personality disorders and mental health and how society can drive an individual to madness. Such a fantastic origin story that could simply be a stand alone film and still work without any links to the comic books.
I saw the film 4 days ago and don't think I've ever left a cinema feeling so utterly blown away by a film in my life. I have not stopped thinking about the film since and cannot wait to watch this masterpiece of film making and acting masterclass again.
Jaoquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips should win every award going when awards season arrive.
And I agree with other comments about Ledgers and Phoenix's portrayals not being comparable. But for me Phoenix's has just slightly edged it ü§°",0

I mean it's the same character but that is all, it ends there, this is much deeper and much more serious, we should compare it to Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro who also plays here (was that intentional?). Joker is a 150 years old character, he's the Underground Man and the he was created by Dostoevsky. Watch it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Thx Mr. J:The Shot in the Arm that DC Needed,"I wanna start by saying that I was a skeptic of this movie but it delivered 10fold and then some. I swore not to get caught up in the hysteria that is Batman's greatest foe but it's well earned and only furthers the mystique that is the Clowned Prince.Addressing the fake news originally reported by Vicki Vale about people walking out of the movie. If you happened to be amongst those weak souls; you deserve every bit of Batman vs Superman and probably list Val Kilmer as your fav BatmanüòíIf you complained at the political undertones I can only conclude you've never seen a DC show. There were some but I saw it more as: art imitating life. Say all this to say: Joker was the blockbuster that DC so desperately needed; Joaquin deserves a standing ovation. It may be an origin story for the Joker but it ultimately serves as a origin story for Batman! Not all too sure where they from here but I'm along for the ride.Lastly be kind to the local weirdo, we all have internal struggles that the world will forever be oblivious of, instead lend a helping hand. Who knows that weirdo may just kill you last?!",0

Joker,Joker rises like a Phoenix!,"Below is the transcript from my video review on my YouTube channel, Slice of Pai. Please subscribe, would mean the world to me and I'm trying to change it :)The Joker. I'm not joking when I say this could be the first time that two different actors could win an Oscar for playing the same character.Now the Joker is one of the most iconic villains of all time, but do not walk into this expecting it to be a typical comicbook movie with blockbuster action.First and foremost it is a character study of the Joker, of one man's descent into madness, but the terrifying part was just how real it all felt. Arthur Fleck, A Fleck, Affleck? is a really sympathetic character at the beginning of the movie and you really feel for him when you see how mistreated he gets just for being different and misunderstood. Things just keep going from bad to worse for him over the course of the movie until he finally snaps when he gets pushed to the edge.And when he hit Rock Bottom, he rose from the ashes like a Joaquin Phoenix.
Because at the end of the day, this is his movie and he carried it with ease. He has clearly been psychologically scarred, his laugh is something like a tic from a neurological condition and he does have something of an Oedipal complex as well. You can see the Joker's physical and mental transformation when he embraces his madness in all its perverse glory.Speaking of physical transformations, his method acting reminded me of Christian Bale's. His emaciated physique was a bit like the Machinest, and parts of the movie also reminded me of American Psycho and had me questioning what was real and what wasn't.As the whole movie is shot from Joker's perspective, it brings some very interesting twists to the Joker and Batman lore. I'll delve into that more in a spoiler section at the end of this video.The film is also a character study of society as a whole, and although it is set in the fictional city of Gotham in 1982, it's still social commentary for today. Too many people tear down others to feel good about themselves, too many people want to see other people fail, too many people have no empathy. The movie shows the dangers of nihilism that is caused by all of the above, and it shines a light on the importance of mental health treatment.The film also brings credence to the expression ""Don't meet your heroes"", as the public personas so many celebrities have of wanting to help people are really just facades, which is something I've noticed as well.The film was excellently directed by Todd Phillipps and although it was a slow burn, that simmering really gave Joker so much nuance and complexity. The colour palette was very gritty and Gotham-esque and gave the movie a depressed ambience to reflect Arthur's.Overall I'd give joker 4.5/5 Pais, but I'm bumping it up to 5 for Joaqin Phoenix's Oscar Worthy performance.Have you seen Joker yet? What did you think about? How do you compare the Jokers? From Hamill, to Nicholson, to Ledger and now to Phoenix? Let me know in the comments below.Thanks for watching, but if you could hit that like and subscribe button I'll thank you even more. If you haven't seen the movie yet, this is where I say bye for now. But if you have, spoiler talk is coming soon.",0

Joker,Wonderstruck!,"Heath Ledger's Joker was a monument that embodied the character in a such a way that no other actor could ever dare to accomplish. Now, 11 years later we have an equator to that epic portrayal of the character in the name of Joaquin Phoenix. Believe it when I say.... The walk, the posture, the cold stare, it's all back on the big screen. Joaquin Phoenix brings the clown prince to life in such a way that viewers will have to think twice before blinking. Coming from Director Todd Phillips, *Joker* takes you on a trip to the Humane side of the character, something that no other Joker movie has ever done. *Joker* is the best comic book movie since *The Dark Knight* and one of the finest portrayals of *one man's descent into maddness*. Academy Awards 2020 will be a war between legends. Joaquin Phoenix vs Leonardo DiCaprio and hopefully Robert DeNiro.

Joker,Awesome,"Being a big batman guy I always thought the Joker worked better without a backstory. But I also love my dark psychological movies, so this still sounded like it was going to be ace, and it is!This isn't an action movie. It's a character study/back story and it has you feeling both sorry for and being creeped out by Phonex. Who (as everyone is saying) is amazing in the movie.This is a well told, expertly made, gritty drama which grabbed my attention in a way that over the top CGI hasn't for a while now.

Joker,Closest to Perfect Story Telling,"Joker - A supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson
Nothing in comparison to the Actors who played joker previously (Not even Considering Jared Leto here)
This character of Arther Fleck (Mentally ill with serious depression and anxiety disorders) stands out as a Class Apart.
The transformation from a Guy that needed Therapy to a Psychotic Killer is unparalleled.
Jokers back story was never fully discussed or shown until this one.
Setting in a time wherein Bruce Wayne is still a Kid.
Arther Fleck is seem fighting a battle of his own within himself that the world/Society chooses to ignore and not care.
This is one movie in a long time that's made me sit through on the edge of the seat without diverting my attention throughout the movie.
Director Todd Philips shine through and truly Deserved that 8minuite Standing Ovation they received at the Premiere.
So much close what we can relate to and that we choose to ignore.
This films Screams right into the heart of every generation.
They must get an Oscar for this one.

Joker,Heartbreaking and Disturbing at the same time,"Within the first few minutes you can't help but feel empathy for Arthur, it's heartbreaking to watch the world be so cruel to him and for him to not fit anywhere. The movie takes you on a journey of feeling sad then to feeling disturbed as Arthur devolves into Joker. At the beginning of the movie he states he did best in hospital care, which is where he should've stayed. This is a movie about how society turns its back on people with mental illness and disabilities, giving them no place in this world and making them feel alone and isolated, which is absolutely heartbreaking. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and he deserves to win an award for his performance. If you don't want to watch some of the disturbing stuff, you can cover your eyes like I did, it's pretty obvious when it's about to happen so you can look away if prefer.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Feelings that I've not felt in a veeeeery long time after watching a movie, reappeared: Happiness, inspiration, deepness. This movie is brilliant. I couldn't believe that FINALLY they created a masterpiece among all the Hollywood that has been coming out lately. I actually was afraid, desillusioned and somewhat sure that this movie would be again just another generic movie, I didn't believe the critics neither. But I'm glad I was wrong. THIS. THIS is the kind of movies that need to be made!!!The scenes drew me in like if they were real, they potrayed everything extremely well. Crude scenes were really disturbing, no horrible soundtrack, no horrible CGI, no shallowness.
The acting was incredible too; prior watching the movie I read some other reviews from ""professional"" critics and they mentioned a lot that the acting was too overwhelming; seriously, WHAT? I think they want some more generic acting or they can't understand what a mentally I'll person actually suffers and how they act. I don't know what is wrong with them, but THIS is the acting that the world actually admires.

Joker,Welcome to the Emancipation of Arthur Fleck,"#JokerCaution: The slow burning schizophrenic emancipation of Arthur Fleck will leave you deeply disturbed, mouth agape in some scenes of pure violence, shocking you to the core.Arthur's fall into insanity is like quicksand. It will pull you along with Arthur down the rabbit's hole. You could try and walk out of the theatre but I doubt you will be able to move.For comicbook fans, Arthur Fleck eventually became the Joker, the one man who could not be moved, the one man who saw the evil in everyone. The one man who knew how to push even the White Knights into darkness, while he danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight (!) laughing away in his own terrible pain, his own deep frustrations, his own madness...This movie is about the final leap he took. The leap into sheer madness. You will become mad along with him. So compelling is this portrayal of the Joker.You could blame the apathy of a dying society for the final push. You could blame his mother. You could blame his colleagues.But in the end, Arthur doesn't blame anyone. Not even the demons in his head.By the end of it all, he learns to dance with them...You can see him do that dance in the end, without saying a word. His deep mad eyes speak it out as if he's shouting it in your face.It will shake you up. It will make you cry.Because you and I, are a part of the Society that drove Arthur to become the Joker...I have never been so disturbed by a movie. I've seen some of the most horrific movies as part of my quest for understanding cinema.This movie is a first. It brings tears to my eyes to write this. You will feel sad for Arthur's madness, twist your heart with the pain he felt.But you will also feel the sheer murderous horror that Arthur becomes. Like an Antichrist rising from the fires of our collective apathy and the death of our tired souls.P. S. To sit through this movie took all of my love for cinema. I have never been so much in awe, ever.",0
Joker,Remarkable,I was skeptical about this movie because I though it would be too difficult to give justice to the character of Joker comparing it to the amazing performance of Heath Ledger. But Joaquin managed to do that remarkably.I didn't find the movie disturbing and I love every bit of it. This is by far one of the best movies I've seen.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0
Joker,He won my vote as the Joker,"As a full pledged Batman fan (ESPECIALLY the animated series), my favorite villian has always been the joker...
Jack N was my favorite personification because he captured the ""clowness"" part of him...
I respected Heith L acting... but, he was NOT the Joker. He was too dark, to somber... too Emo.
But THIS movie wowed me!!
I dont know the kind of reaserch he did (if any) to portray him. But Joaquin Pheonix managed to capture all the key elements of the Joker in a way that makes it real yet maintaing the clown part. I can swear I see features/aspects or scenes from the animated series but grounded to a real life scenario... what would it look like if he was real? It cant be funny funny... he is a psicopath and a killer, but he thinks its all a joke.
Those easter eggs that only I saw, like a ""its just a joke!""... ""sometimes people just dont get it"".
Plus more references made that justified obsessions...
His acting was AMAZING... you can feel his pain and desperation and why he would go crazy and hide behind his clown persona... and you pitty and fear him.
I could SO believe a Harleen Quinzel fall for Joaquin's Joker. NOT that gangster pimp ridiculous attempt.
Even if you are not a Batman fan and don't know or care about the story... you have to recognize the acting. It is a powerfull drama...
And if you are a fan, you have to recognize that he manages to ground him to a real life portrayal while maintaining the comicality of the fact that he ""is"" funny or tries & thinks he is.. a psicopathic clown.",0

Joker,Great build up for explosive ending,"This movie is not about 'how much action can we cram into one sitting', rather, it is about the slow build up of a truly twisted character. Arthur's character is the sole focal point during the entire film, allowing the audience to live through his backstory with no interruptions. The music, dancing, and crude laughter draws you into the world of Arthur, and eventually, the Joker. With that being said, the transformation into the Joker is a very intense and occasionally bloody journey; but, every step of this process has meaning behind it and nothing seemed overly done, or out of place. Some scenes are very dark, but the backstory leading up to them makes them even more impactful when witnessing them on the screen.
I wouldn't know what the correct category for this movie is, but it hits hard in the psychological department as you watch this character's mind explode out of its shell by the end.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"Brilliantly Done, Definitely Movie of the Year","I never thought I'd become a fan of the joker but the movie was a masterpiece. It touched on many societal issues and the story unfolded just perfectly. Phoenix's acting was brilliant. Every scene was just beautiful and even the killing was depicted in an aesthetic way. Kudos to Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix.For the mainstream critics who think this movie is somehow controversial, instead of blaming movies and video games for potential shooting, think about what really has been happening in our society that pushes people off the edge to do crazy things like that. I think you guys can learn a great lesson from the movie Joker.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Disease as Superficial Power,"This movie dramatizes the sad story of Arthur's mental anguish in which he asks people to call him Joker. He was the victim of abuse in his family, in his employment, and his intimate relationships. He was aware of personal health issues, but he was persistently trying to use his mental problems to his advantage. He was desperately trying to be funny in all kinds and circumstances which resulted in a terrible major realization in a subway accident. Joker was bound by his dreams (or delusions - depending on the viewer's perspective) and his vision of justice. The movie allows the audience to feel the hurt of Joker and horrible consequences of his actions. All artistic tools and contributions involved in this movie make this story full of anxiety and depression. This movie is a perfect companion for autumn melancholy and bad Halloween memories.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Send In The Clown,"So Joker just hit theaters with a whopping amount of money being brought in for the studio during the first weekend.I don't know where to start when talking about this movie, so let's just start with the details. Joker is a movie about a psychopath in the making. It shows how a man suffering from a mental illness was transformed into the clown prince of crime that we all know now as the infamous joker. He has an uncontrollable condition of laughing at the wrong moments.The next point that I am going to make is about the reality of this movie. I believe that this movie was a call for gun violence bans, because it shows that in the wrong hands a gun can be very powerful. This was also a reality call in the sense that mental illness patients are not cared for as much as we should be caring for them, in other words say someone has physical damage everyone's gathering around them and supporting them but when someone has a mental illness they are isolated away from most people.Next up was the violence in this movie. Now the movie wasn't heavy on it but when it was there, there was a lot of blood. What made it worse was when the music playing made it feel suspenseful.After that, there was the feeling you felt when watching this movie. I am not going to lie to you this is a depressing movie, it is sad and he gets constantly beat up whether it's mentally or physically. It is sad and disheartening to see.Next is the director and actors. I believe Todd Phillips did a terrific job when directing this movie, he made it fit in with the comic book origins but still maintained a point of gun violence control. In my opinion he chose a stellar cast. Joaquin Phoenix was one of the best joker actors and, in my opinion, I thought he was one of the best actors, I thought he was at or better than Heath Ledger's portrayal of the ionic character. Another actor that was good in this was Robert De Niro when he represented a character that acted like the late night host Johnny Carson, Robert was outstanding in this movie.A movie that was like this. One of the movies that they brought in to portray this movie, Taxi Driver had the same gritty feel. Don't get me wrong both movies are really good but I believe joker was better.Finally my opinion of it. I believe anyone who just likes a good suspense movie should go watch this. It had a really good plot (not easy to follow, because joker imagines stuff), it had a massive play twists and it was just an overall good movie I would rate it a 10/10, best movie of the year. I am excited to see what the future holds for this version of the joker.Spoiler alert for the next section...My theory of what the ending meant. I believe that the joker was telling the story of the movie to the therapist at the end. He believed that he was the ""Savior"" that everyone needed, to bring laughter and joy to the world. In an allusion I believe Gotham was a Dynamite stick and joker was the fuse.",0

Joker,This IS the only Joker,"This film is 90% Arthur Fleck and 10% Joker. That is not a bad thing because the facts are so organic as they unfold, this becomes the Joker backstory that you never knew you needed.
I'm a huge fan of both of Tim Burton's Batman films, & who doesn't love Jack Nickolson? But this Joker gets moved to the front of all the lines, and makes Heath Ledger's J look contrived.
I was never a fan of his interpretation.
Let's not even mention the one-who-shall-not-be-named in the most recent J in Suicide Squad. Trash. Complete trash.And, if you're a fan of Villain Dances like I am, this one is EPIC. It is awkward in the most real & vulnerable way and then rises to Mick Jagger perfection at the pinnacle.
Conflict & incongruity are what makes the villain dances so mesmerizing. My benchmark has always been creepy Mr Blond from Res Dogs when he's gleefully torturing the street cop, but Sam Rockwell always steals any show with his style anytime he's fulfilling his bad guy rolls. Joaquin and his villain dance aren't so forthright, it takes a few tries and he doesn't get it right every time, that's what makes the scene on the stairs so powerful & almost orgasmic. It's a glimpse into what his complete transformation will look like once he's embraced his alter ego, fully.
There's some other fun facts? that will shake up the DC Universe if you pay attention to details.
This film will absolutely be triggering to anyone who has suffered abuse, neglect, bullying, apathy from ppl supposed to help, or just downright inhumane treatment.

Joker,The worst part of having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave like you don't!,"Never did I expect ""Joker"" to have the impact on me it did! I went in expecting a grandiose, dark and twisted character study with a top notch lead performance and came out richly rewarded with that and so much more. Not only does ""Joker"" provide us with a unique take on the origins of The Joker, it also provides us with an in-depth character study on mental illness and the corrupt, narcissistic and anarchic society we all live In, but some of whom struggle to see, through their rose-tinted glasses!
.
The most important message I received which really hit me hard due to my own experiences with mental health and my own somewhat troubled past is the fact that anyone one of us could of potentially been or still could be a semblance of ""The Joker,"" and Todd Phillips has, with this film, presented us with an articulate presentation on what personal trauma could possibly turn someone into the joker and what little is done to prevent such terrible things from unfolding.
.
I cannot help but think, wow, what if my life turned out like that, what if I went through all that pain and suffering, because it's real, this stuff has actually happened and is still happening all over the world. What kind of person would I of turned into? There's only so much a person can take before they snap, and once they do, could you really blame that person for breaking? Especially when the world is already broken. And when society shuns you to the side without listening, helping, supporting or caring, it's just like setting off a ticking-time-bomb, placing it in a busy crowd and then just waiting until it explodes.
.
Let's be honest, people don't want to understand or actually help, some are too scared to accept it and some are too up their own asses to even realise, and then when you finally feel brave enough to try and get medical help, they're just quick to label you with some sort of ""mental illness,"" feed you some crap about how to ""get better,"" prescribe you some meds and then send you on your way, most don't even care about knowing why you're actually feeling like this, and if they don't like what they hear or you're ""too broken,"" they're quick to lock you up without bothering to find the true source of the pain and the actual cause or causes of said issues.
.
I'm not ashamed to say, there were times during this film where tears flooded my eyes due to the pain of Arthur Fleck. It truly broke my heart seeing, nay feeling what he was going through with no help at all, in-fact, quite the opposite; every kick in the gut was quickly followed up with more kicks to the gut, it is not a light story! The screenplay is constantly real, raw and quotable, constantly asking questions that really make you think. The score is riveting and definitely a highlight of the film, every chord that was struck shook me to my core, the soundtrack is pitch-perfect and the cinematography was beautiful and atmospheric.
.
There are truly no words for Joaquins performance, I was and still am completely blown away by his physical transformation and the authenticity of his character. Every scene he's in, just the look of his tormented face and his haunted expressions has you on the edge of your seat, terrified to find out what's going to happen next. How he manages to capture the true essence of Arthur's pain in one single laugh is absolutely harrowing and his delivery of every single line is venomous and of the utmost importance! If he's not atleast nominated for an Oscar, chaos will ensue, just like it did here!
.
The supporting performances where all perfect; they helped express the intensity and severity of the storyline and Joaquin's central performance. The brutality of this film is needed and personally all of the BS circulating this film is unwarranted. You cannot blame a film for potentially influencing violence because of its brutal and dark nature when it's giving a raw depiction of our world we live in now and when one of its main objectives is to shed a little light on what society could/should do to prevent these situations from ever happening. Everyone should see this film for the multiple insightful messages it provides, Joaquin's (fingers-crossed) oscar winning performance and Todd Phillips' unflinching direction! Must See!",0
Joker,Heartbreaking and COLOSSAL,"I have read a lot of reviews about this film commenting on the cinematography and the music (haunting) and the outstanding direction (Phillips) and acting (Phoenix) but none has expressed how utterly heartbreaking Phoenix's portrayal of a grown man who has suffered child abuse and neglect is - it is physically painful to watch - utterly beautiful and heartbreaking. I felt as if I'd taken him home with me after the film; his all consuming embodiment of the tortured man who is Arthur Fleck attaches itself to you like a needy animal and doesn't let go for days. And then only reluctantly. How he manages this is mesmerising. The violence in the film is gratuitous but feels inevitable and 'justified' given how he has suffered. It is of course coming from a sociopath who so clearly has been created by the neglect of a mother who suffered from mental illness, herself. The violence he inflicts is the manifestation of the utter rage and emptiness he feels. Phoenix lives this onscreen. This is what is so utterly devastating, exhausting, colossal and enveloping about his embodiment of Arthur . And it is an embodiment, not a performance. It's too real to be a performance.
I totally agree with another reviewer who says that if you're not willing to develop you're own thoughts about the subject in a film as dark and vast as this - watch something else. You'll feel it physically but you're brain will try to process what you've just been through, so be prepared.
Utterly transfixed was I for the ENTIRE film. Life changing. And utter kudos to the director and lead actor who were not afraid to show us mental illness and it's heartbreaking affects (extreme though they may be, here) and it's legacy, in all it's deep, dark relentlessness.",0

Joker,Only certain people can relate,"In my opinion the purpose of making this joker a film so that people's minds are open, can see it from different sides / perspectives. There is no film that justifies / teaches if the murder is true, it is not possible to teach revenge which is the right thing. So the goal here is how we treat ourselves for other people / people suffering from this disease. while Arthur was on the Murray Franklin show he said 'Thomas Wayne doesn't know that people can be wild' wild which means here are those who don't get justice and want to vent their anger. So my conclusion is that crime not only comes from people's desires but can also be caused by accidental or unwillingness of people about it but only wants to respond accordingly. that's why religion is important. And the creation of the Joker character is due to the people who created their own demons1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,A Masterpiece.,"Just got back home from seeing this a second time. I loved it even more. I say this with no exaggeration... This film is a masterpiece. Please go see it, but be prepared for some heavy material. This is a very real exploration of a psychopathic killer. It is extremely violent, and often hard to watch, but always with a purpose. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable. He disappears completely into this character. The evolution we see this tortured man go through would have fallen flat with a lesser actor in the role. Luckily, Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. On the technical end, this film is beautifully shot and Todd Philips' direction is haunting. The story, while familiar, is unique and fresh.

Joker,A Masterpiece of Cinema,"Joker was the film I was most looking forward to this year! To be honest after the high point of Avengers Endgame, I was kind of feeling tired of all these superhero films. Even DC's Shazam (although a fun film) still felt very safe. However, DC had one more film up their sleeves that left me intrigued. No rhyme intended! JOKER! A film starring Joaquin Phoenix as the titular clown prince of crime. I'd always liked the character of the Joker, a phydistic clown who goes around causing mayhem.To me, there had been no definitive version of the Joker. I liked pretty much every interpretation of the Joker each had their own style. From Heath Ledgers mysterious crazed terrorist. Too Cesar Romero's clumsy clown. Heck, I even like Jared Leto's portrayal. That's why I was looking forward to see what Joaquin Phoenix could bring to the table.When the first trailer was released early this year, I was very pleased too see that this film was going for a dark gritty mature tone. It was a chance for DC to develop their most beloved villain with no restrictions. The Joker is insane and having us be able to see his violent crime would impact the general audience even more than any prior incarnation.The news that this was also going to be a standalone film with no connections to the DCEU excited me even more as the film could be itself without having to connect to a larger universe. At this point my hype was through the roof and it Id had to wait a few more months until I could see it.On October 5th I sat down to watch a film that promised to be an achievement in film. So after the film came to its conclusion I was left in me seat stunned. What a masterpiece!The film is an interesting intense depressing journey into the mind of the man who was going to become the Joker. It's about a man rejected by society and his revenge against. To me it felt refreshing to have comic book fill that felt nothing like a traditional comic book film. It felt like a psychological thriller. It felt refreshing. Not entirely new though. It took a lot of inspiration from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy and it is so obvious but this isn't necessarily a bad thing as it takes the best aspects of those films and greats a film which is shocking and thought provoking. The film is shot amazingly. Every shot has a purpose and it adds to the overall tone of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Joker and Arthur Fleck. You may be wondering why I refer to the Joker and Arthur Fleck as two different characters as to me these two sides of the same person are very different. And yesI'll say it again he deserves an Oscar for his performance. Robert De Niro is also an amazing addition to the cast he plays a late night talk show host called Murray Franklin and encompasses everything about a talk show host is about. He plays quite a significant role in Arthur's story and helps him become Joker. The supporting cast is also good but don't steal the show like Phoenix which is good because it's he movie.If your going into Joker thinking this is going to be your typical superhero action film your going to be very disappointed. Also, if you want to watch a film where the Joker commits crimes and antagonises the caped crusader this isn't the film for you. The Joker isn't even in the film to the very end of the film but boy is it good when he emerges. But I digress this film is about how the man becomes the Joker not about the Joker. Yes it's misleading to call the film joker but that's the point. However Joker is a marvellous piece of cinema and deserves to be given a chance. That's why I give it the highest rating of 10/10",0
Joker,Oscar nomination please,Joaquin Pheonix became the joker in this 100%. He put on an amazing performance. He portrayed the effects of mental illness and the effects society can have on someone. Brilliantly done. Wish he killed more people though. Hopefully theres another one. Joaquin in NOW the joker!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0
Joker,Who would have thought that Joker could be relatable!,"What would happen if someone took a beloved villain and rewrote their entire history? Surely, at first everyone would freak, because of the caricature of the character recent adaptions have offered. This is not the case here. Joker is what happens when they take a well worn character and they actually develope them, not just give them a modern day outlook but without the respective way of thinking. Basically it is like the writer thought how would the Joker be created today, without the toxic wastes. In my opinion, Joker is a brilliant combination of comic book accuracy and innovation, giving modern means and conditions to the villain we know (if after watching the movie we can still call him that), while also staying true to what makes the character tick.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"This movie is like no other, just utterly amazing","All I have to say is watch this movie and do not expect it to be like the joker your originally know or any other superhero/villain move you have seen because this one is a masterpiece in its own realm that no other movie could touch. From start to finish this movie keeps you locked in. You always felt like something crazy was about to happen, and you wont be wrong, if you love thrills mixed with grim laughter this movies is for sure for you. If you cant stand blood or dark movies and expect it to be a lovey dovey Marvel esque movie then it might not be for you.

Joker,"A cinematic masterpiece, though gut wrenching","I have never thought to rate a movie. Personally, no movie comes to mind other than this title that is really worth raving about so ceaselessly as I've done since I saw it in theaters. I'll admit that I have no previous interest in superhero/villain movies, comics, etc, and I never really got into the whole Batman thing, BUT this film has me impressed. It's a different breed, and that's what I like about it. It explores the mind of a struggling man in a troubled life, and Joaquin Phoenix plays the part phenomenally. It's believable, it portrays interesting examples of what may happen with a mental illness, and the emotion I drew from it had me squirming in my seat. Many parts were uncomfortable, yes, but that may be because I'm a sensitive person, and the movie inducing this feeling isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seeks out emotion and sympathy.
I'm no great and knowledgeable movie critic, as I stated prior, but I did enjoy Joker enough to go as far as to make an IMDb account just to rate the movie. I enjoyed it that much. I do plan on purchasing a DVD of the film as soon as possible and giving it a re-watch.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,A mirror that nobody wants to look at.,"I'll let other people focus on the incredible cinematography, nuanced acting, superb writing and detailed score. It's all amazing in my vastly unqualified opinion. What I'd like to offer my thoughts on is the underlying, cultural importance of this stunning, Kafkaesque caricature of life in an often solitary bubble that we somewhat ironically refer to as civilisation. It is the story of a man stripped to nothing but the subjective will to power without restriction, √† la Nietzsche's 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra'. The introjected values that tether Arthur Fleck to society are diminished when they are not reflected in the behaviour of others that continuously overlook and mistreat him on account of his illness. He is relentlessly denied autonomy, agency, self-determination and subjectivity by a cold and abusive world until his climactic metamorphosis as this nightmarish, maniacal overman. I think the violence in the film speaks to a part of the viewer that we actively suppress because of our own introjected values and conditions. We leave the cinema and go about our day accepting that we've just witnessed an exciting, moving and deeply upsetting fiction. Yet in our dissonance between the aroused exhilaration and disgust, we are forced to acknowledge the very conditions that keep us in check within our role in society. It is a kind of thought experiment which ultimately highlights a very clear truth; society has a responsibility for it's own mental health, even more so to those that we have neglected and let down to the point that they break catastrophically. The upset and outrage inspired by the film is sort of the whole point. A film or videogame can't inspire violence in the meek, passive members of society who's sensibilities and expectations tell them that what they are seeing is horrific and unsettling. That's absurd. Equally, it can't inspire disturbing behaviour in those with the capacity to go out into the world and commit such acts. That darkness was already there, and it was foreshadowed by a lifetime of trauma and neglect. No, Joker doesn't beckon the bogeyman and instruct him to wreak havoc on the world. It simply holds a mirror up to society, showing us that the bogeyman is already here. We don't like what we see in our dire reflection because we were comfortable here in our faux, utopian soft play of ignorance and dismissiveness. It comes as no surprise that the establishment are already railing against this message, because they are the most comfortable of all. Let's not forget that we live in a world where pivotal books such Robert Cormier's The Chocolate War and Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower are still routinely removed from libraries. Yet, this bosom world in which we nestle is a fiction in itself. We value society because it offers protection, but what about the times when it fails? What about the neglected and the marginalised? Those that do commit radical acts of violence have ultimately been let down by the very social contract that promises to protect them, and it is on all of us to do something about it or accept our responsibility for the consequences. Joker is more than just a very important and timely admission of our shortcomings. It is a call to action; Not for revolution or civil unrest, but for compassion.",0

Joker,Masterpiece!!,Joker(2019) is not the conservative take on clown price of crime's origin story. The story is not related to comic book but everyone after watching this movie will forget about everyone who has played joker before joaquin pheonix. The film is dark and depicts arthur fleck's daily struggle with society while simultaneously fighting with a rare medical which corners him from society. The film portrays how a failed stand-up comedian turns criminal and what circumstances made him to do so. Joaquin pheonix is legendary in the movie his performance is on another level. He has made himself eternal as the Joker. In future when we will talk about joker we will most probably think of joaquin phenix's portrayal than any other one out there. The movie is a masterpiece and will be remebered as a cult classic for sure.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,0

Joker,An inward look psychological rollercoaster.,"Managing to stay true to the comics in an origin sorry based on the joker is tricky, due to the very nature of the character and the lack of knowledge of his former life which we have to go on. Without spoiling anything, much of this movie takes place in the viewers own mind. Leaving more questions by the end than you had going in, the movie manages to pull off showing us the Jokers history, while having us question if what we are seeing is in any way real, or if it depicts the character we think we all know. There are a few nods to the batman comics, but it isn't a batman movie in any way. Really, it isn't even a joker movie. It's a movie about a fractured mind in a fractured world, and it's self imposed confirmation, slowly becoming a character we both love and loath. Creepy, disturbing, intense. Phoenix really nails this version of the character, but also manages to capture the lonely, sad life of Arthur, leading us to fully understand, and both completely misunderstand the journey he takes during the course of the film.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Just one man steals the show,"Who else could have played it better? What Joaquin portraited was sensational. What he showed on screen was nerve rattling, act was fantastic as good as it could be for any known best performance.
Though something was pulling the whole package down, for the movie to be top notch. Joaquin put on a tragic victim scene, a person rotting/broke down by system in Gotham city, but story didn't reflect much of it. Why did he had to kill 3 people? Can't get enough empathy for his actions. The whole story theme was in trailer.
Having said this, I still want to see it many times, see the Joaquin act again. Something is still captivating about the JOKER that makes it such a great movie to watch1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,An absolute masterpiece. Critics are offended by this movie and here's why....,"I will start off by saying I had very high hopes for this movie, but was not expecting it to live up to the hype. Neither was I expecting Joaquin Phoenix to even get close to measuring up to Heath Ledger's Dark Knight performance. I will admit I am a huge fanboy of Ledger, so when I say that Phoenix blew me away and gave an equally amazing performance in this film and that this movie is probably the best movie made during this decade, I absolutely mean that.This movie is more than just an origin story. It's an in depth view of how someone becomes a villain and the factors that lead to it. To start off, yes, Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker, is mentally unstable and suffers a condition that forces him to laugh in situations he shouldn't laugh in. Mix this with his anxiety, he is put in positions that are extremely uncomfortable that he doesn't want to be in. It also doesn't help that his social worker doesn't listen to him and is disgruntled by the fact that the government she works for doesn't value her profession enough to keep it alive. Arthur Fleck is a good person at heart in the beginning and is trying his absolute best to be happy and make people happy. But as the movie goes on, his attempts to do everything in his power are crushed, and ultimately, he hits a breaking point, leading the Joker to become a psychotic murderer.This above mentioned point is why I think critics and the media are quick to dismiss this movie, because it does not fit the ""guns and weapons"" are the problem narrative. If you look at any tragedy that happens, what get blamed? The weapon, or ideology in 99% of the cases. The media does this because it advances an agenda that they align themselves with. Heaven forbid the people committed the crime was actually just mentally ill and just looking for validation for their actions. Or better yet, will get recognition and fame from, you guessed it, the media.Now, where does the Joker fit in to the above mentioned point? Why I loved this movie so much is that the Joker sees validation for his actions. At first, the first murder is shocking, he's scared, and honestly the first murders could be justified as self defense. But as the media portray's the support he receives, he starts to think that what he is doing is ok, and ultimately there are some people that view him as a hero. Why, because the media allowed this happen and society validated it by supporting him.Aside from this point, the movie itself is phenomenally done. This is hands down the best origin story to have been made. It's brutally honest, it's dark, it's violent, and very uncomfortable at times. Phoenix's performance is the best I've ever seen him do. He deserves the Oscar, and quite honestly this movie deserves best picture. But it probably won't win it because it doesn't 1) Say everyone that is white is a racist or 2) Have a liberal agenda. or 3) Say guns are the reason for mass shootings, 4) Say's ""Orange man bad"".Critics are out of touch, and honestly are an invalid profession. Critic is another word for ""someone who gets paid to share an opinion."" At the time of this review, the movie has a 9.0/10 rating from ~150K users, with a metascore of 58 from less than 100. Listen to the masses instead of the ""Elite"" who claim to know better than you. This movie is worth the viewing.",0
Joker,The king is dead.. Long live the king!,"Despite the title, I'm not going to compare Joaquin's Joker with Heath's here. This is a different film altogether. Heath brought us a beautifully crafted fully formed joker in DK, JP however brings us Arthur Fleck in all his disturbed severely mentally ill glory. It would be like comparing a caterpillar to it's butterfly..It's much less of a comic book movie than a horror film. In fact in parts of the film I forgot I was actually watching the formation of the joker, as Joaquin pulls us so deep into Arthur's illness, it becomes impossible to relate that character to anything remotely 'comic book'.Joaquin Phoenix is exceptional in this movie and he has to be, there is no supporting cast as such for him to hide a shoddy performance, just transient characters that either serve to further provoke or highlight Arthur's illness. Todd Phillips did a marvelous job here of making all of the characters bar Arthur somewhat disposable, they exist but only as a tool for Joaquin to use to craft Arthur. Even Di Nero is a passenger here, his character just used as a catalyst for Arthur's eventual brutal full metamorphosis into Joker. With that said though he plays his role beautifully and it was wonderful to see that man back where he belongs in a piece of cinematic history. The climax of the scene between them is just a thing of absolute movie genius, crafted out by two of our times greatest actors.I'm not sure how the movie got it's 15 rating here in the UK. The violence though not continuous is disturbing in it's realism, indeed the whole film felt 'adult'. It's definitely not a 15 that I'd be letting my 13 year old son watch anytime soon. I guess it's a box office thing!In all honesty though as much as I loved this film, I don't know if I could give it a second watch. Maybe that will change over time but right now I feel it's a movie like the usual suspects or seven.. I want to hold onto the surprise of this film, because I went in expecting something entirely different to what I was presented with.Joaquin's always been a slightly underrated actor for me. He's been nominated for three academy awards, most notably of which were best actor for Walk the line and best supporting actor for Gladiator, but has won none. His portrayal of Commodus especially was deserving of an Oscar. Tell me a movie villain you've ever hated more than that? I struggle to find one personally!! He MUST get an Oscar for this performance!!",0
Joker,A bothering movie,"We lack so much of true, unrestricted art nowadays because of our seemingly growing attachement to ""morallity"" that questioning the status quo is seen like a threat to society,its like a new form of the old inquisition has grown legitimately beetween us so naturally, like it has back on the medieval age, that no one seems to notice. And the funny thing is that the movie seems to be so precise in its point of view that it has provoked a response in the actual system exactly as it would in the ficcional, from the movie. The people in control really want to control what we see and know in an almolst utopian level that is hard to believe. The morallity made critics and a part of the people who watched and were not ready for the thruth contained in the movie to dabate a possible censorship of the film, as it was even legal to do so with a piece of art.
Unfortunately, the opressive force of society really gets real nasty sometimes, and even now so many people ignore it. I, as a graduate from med school, can say from my little experience in a psychiatric ward that the plot, the movie, and the character doesn't seem as nearly insane as its beeing talked about when you know and understand what gets someone ""crazy"". Its real sad to see that society believes its evolving so fiercely, when its actually dehumanizing itself to a terrorrizing level just because we refuse to see the truth that surrounds us, and then call it morrally correct. Thats why the film bothers a few people so much, its not about the glorifiyng of violence or caos, its because it shows how the system breaks a man(even though it might seem exagerated to people who haven't seen it for real) and thats why it has to be seen.",0

Joker is more like a European film than a dis American it's a stand-alone film ma that shows depth and perfect character development. we can see Arthur going from going from hiding himself in a shell that he calls Arthur but he unleashes what has always been hidden under Arthur in the end of the movie The Joker.

Joker,Watch This Film!!!!!,"I want to be completely honest in giving my review of this film. I am a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but I was not very excited about this project. I believed the DC tales of Batman and the Joker were overly exhausted to the point they were no longer entertaining. I wholeheartedly thought I would hate this film.
With that said, I was completely shocked with the depth in story telling, phenomenal acting, and brilliant dialogue delivered by this film.
This is not a superhero/ villain story. This story goes much deeper into societal norms which are troubling and in many cases disturbing, but routinely go overlooked. This story dives into the psyche of a person who has experienced physical, emotional, and mental trauma at the hands of a society that really doesn't value him as a person and thus discards him completely as a sort of joke.
The politics associated with this film are very familiar and relevant to what we see and experience in today's political climate.
Some fear that those in power may see it as a threat towards the status quo, while those who feel oppressed may see it as a call to arms.
I completely understand why media is trying to discourage people from seeing this film; it is not because it doesn't deliver, but because it really does. This is a film that makes one pause, think and acknowledge that there are situations in this world that require us to be more human. It also opens our eyes to the class systems which still exist in our societies and how change is necessary to disrupt and eradicate those unfair and unjust systems.
I recommend everyone go see this film! üëçüèºüëçüèº",0

Joker,Insanely twisted.,"I went into this movie with VERY high expectations because of all the rave reviews and controversy and I as not disappointed at all. In fact it exceeded my expectations. I've never seen a more gritty, dark and twisted movie in my life.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is probably one of the best if not THE BEST acting performances I've ever seen. He is by far the best joker so far. From the Joker's laugh, mannerisms, down to the way her runs. Joaquin perfected it all. He definitely deserves every award this coming season. Heath Ledger would be proud.Just don't watch it expecting an action packed comic movie. It's all about the joker's origin and his slow decent into insanity. It's so unsettling and uneasy I can see why some people walked out.

Joker,First Impressions: One to Think About,"Knock knock...Joker is about Arthur Fleck, he's a disturbed and formerly hospitalized clown in Gotham City who lives with his sick mother he takes care of. He also has aspirations of being a stand up comic and is a big fan of the Murray Franklin Show, Gotham's big TV late night talk show and after a video of Arthur's bizarre stand up act gets shown on the show... he's invited to be appear on the show for an interview.So I JUST saw this movie....And... it's all still flushing around in my head so I'm having a hard time writing a proper review for it. I keep starting to write and then I start over and so on... so I wouldn't call this a review, more ""first impressions"".Because there's a lot to get into with this movie and there's things to discuss.I got home from Avengers: Endgame and knew exactly what I thought about it.Joker... I don't know, I need some time and maybe even to see it again. Maybe in IMAX which I can't BELIEVE Warner Bros put the time and effort into making an IMAX version of THIS movie...But... I liked it... might have even loved it.... but it's not perfect. It's not the R-rated Joker movie of my dreams.... which would kinda just be The Dark Knight but with blood. Like I already GOT my perfect Batman AND Joker movie in 2008 so anything after that is a nice bonus.There's nothing in it I disliked but... it never hit heights I would have hit if I was given the keys to the Gotham City kingdom. For one thing, it's a shockingly small movie, hence my slack-jawed reaction to finding out that right now people are watching this in IMAX.It's a psychological thriller, it's not a horror movie or a crime drama. It's a drama about an insane person.The movie it reminded me of the most wasn't even the Scorsese movies Todd Phillips says he was inspired by but One Hour Photo. This is a 2 hour movie where the only guy we're with is a complete psychopath.There's no hero in this movie. There's no relief, there's nobody trying to stop the Joker. So the worse he gets, the more tense the movie gets because we know there's no Batman or Commissioner Gordon coming to the rescue here. So this makes for a pretty unpleasant movie.Joaquin Phoenix gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Joker and he might even win for this movie. Is he better than Heath Ledger? No.... but it's SUCH a different version of the character it's not even comparable.... which brings me to maybe my main complaint with this movie....I think.... this movie would be a LOT better.... if it were not called Joker. I think knowing it's The Joker I had so many expectations of where this movie would take this character and that kinda hurt my first viewing.Maybe on a rewatch that'll go away completely but I kept thinking this movie would play better if you didn't know you were watching a movie about the Batman villain The Joker until the final act. Because I certainly kept expecting a lot more... Joker-y type stuff in this movie and it really doesn't tap into the Joker I'm familiar with.This isn't a criminal mastermind mixed with a serial killer with a permanent smile, it's not Nicholson's Joker or Ledger's Joker.... it's a whole new thing.It really is more of a Joker origin story than a Joker movie. Like this entire movie almost feels like the first act of a proper Joker solo movie. I REALLY hope they make a sequel because as much as I enjoyed elements of it I wanted way more.Lack of Batman is not the issue here at all, by the way. Joaquin Phoenix does more than enough to carry the movie on his own but.... at the end of the day I wanted more of a horror movie, more of a crime movie.What we GOT was very good..... but I can't help but think it could have been better.This is not a proper concise review, I might be able to have one in the near future. Because like I said there's loads to get into.But I'll say I liked what I saw... but I need more time to process it.I'm definitely VERY curious to hear what others think of Joker.",0

Joker,must be a joke to vote this down,"First review for me,but i had to do it for the non-thinkers.
no spoilers here,even if you watch several trailers,like i did,it is packed with action! -no,not the headless running around cgi-kind that fills our minds with nonexistent bullcrap theese days. i.am a long time fan of comics(never looked at joker like this) and hate the disaster movies lately. heroes in comics did not kill half of the population while bringing the bad guy down. that anyone goes on with their lifes,smiling at the hero saving the day but missing 3/4 of their families.i mean,i get it now,while i.am writing,why people don.t like it. because they maybe expected that joker starts jumping around 20 feet up in the air,ripping of buildings and eating humans,or at least cars.to smash half of the city and being chased down by cgi-bats. and it.s because this is a true movie,about a true character. it is so real,you can almost touch the world he is living in-because it is actually our world. a bit of fresh air for as long as i can.t remember. just when i thought,there will be no true movies any more. THIS ONE,my friends,will make you think about society and yourself.then again,people don.t think any more. they just want to be lied to and fed with cgi-popcorn and vr-juice. but in the end,it.s ok...it.s not a movie for everyoneif you look at it and admit it.s a perfect picture of us and what this world is we are living in,it.s a win. if you want impossible jumps and disaster packed ""hero""-film,go see everything else.oh,and one more thing in regard of vigilante. i love the fact that joker is(or,at least starts of with)cleaning people that are just garbage of society (the ""superrats""),and that before any other self proclaimed rich justice leader. for me,he is the first vigilante of all. used to look up to batman in my childhood and later too, but this ladies and gents ""is what you get..."",and it.s a mature film for those who lived enpugh to experience the society we live in.tonight was the second time I saw it and it's getting better.edit:watched it 5x...and the acting is outstanding. it.s my fav.movie now...because of J.P. what he did here,if you are a movie fan,you can not oversee it. it.s magnificent,tons of moments of real emotions. this is cinema at it.s best",0
Joker,Film of the Year,"A cinematic event to be remembered - with themes of mental illness, bullying, the subjective nature of comedy, mob mentality/political outrage, trauma, murder, rich vs poor and an Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, JOKER makes for a disturbing, stressful, uncomfortable 2 hours that will leave you thinking about the blurred lines between good people and bad people, and the people who pretend to be good and the good people that become bad.Out of this world sound design and cinematography make this a must-watch if you can handle it. Earns its hard R too.9/101 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Surpassed expectations,"I'm a huge DC fan. I knew from the first trailer this was going to be a good movie. Joaquin Phoenix surpasses all my expectations. His performance deserves an Oscar. Also, the music was so haunting and beautiful. It definitely helped set the tone. Couldn't have been better. This movie makes you think about the affects society can have on a person.

Joker,Joaquin puts a human being into the Joker,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this movie was stunning as he plays a mentally challenged man who lives in an even crazier world. The movie explains how Arthur evolves into The Joker we know from Batman. However, this Joker is vulnerable and a victim of traumatic circumstances. I am moved by how well Joaquin brings this comic character to life and creates an image of a believable human being who doesn't want to be a victim anymore. There are several thought provoking elements in this movie - like, this is what happens when you place a gun into the hands of a mentally and emotionally lost and drainef person. Can't wait to see this movie again - I personally find Joaquins acting exceptional and mesmorizing - and Oscar worthy!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,masterpiece,Joker is a film that is disturbing and uncomfortable in all the right ways. It manages to pull off an original and unique spin in the superhero genre. The only complaint in the film that I can think of is that it is just a bit too simaler to taxi driver and king of comedy. Don't believe the contravercy trying to make you afraid to see this movie.

Joker,Chilling,"This rendition of the Joker is absolutely nuts! That is simply the only rational way to describe. I went into the movie with very high expectations, and may I say those expectations have been exceeded. The way Phoenix portrays him is so incredible, and the scariest part is that he managed to humanize this psychopath and almost make you pity him. I left the movie theater in a state of shock, not completely comprehending the beauty I just saw.
Another thing which was done so beautifully in this movie was the way that it strayed away from the DCU and comic book movies as a whole. If this film could be closely related to any film prior it would be ""Taxi Driver"" by Martin Scorsese. All in all, it was incredible movie that is more than likely to make some serious noise at the upcoming oscars!1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,You must understand,There have been many movies I have watched over the years. I have seen them all. I must say that movies that are written well are those that make you get lost in the story.

Joker,A masterpiece,"I really liked this movie and if the times were different it would probably win an Oscar or two. Joaquin Phoenix is truly outstanding in this film and the scenography is perfect just like the soundtrack.
The intense music just added to the dread I felt while being insecure of how Arthur would react to stuff.
This is a movie worth seeing, maybe more than once.

Joker,Great movie made in my lifetime (I'm almost 40),"This movie is a heartbreaking testimony of the failure of various levels of our society. It speaks to cruelty, altruism, the misunderstood, the over-medicated, child abuse, judgement, bullying, mob mentality, mental illness, loneliness, trauma, neglect, ineffectiveness of our mental health care system, cognitive dissonance and poverty.

Joker,One of the best performances I've ever seen. Puts others to shame.,"I usually hate origin stories for bad guys. I don't need to know why they ended up that way. Prometheus in my opinion ruined the Aliens but Joker is something else. Jacquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Some scenes are just uncomfortable to watch and that's all down to him. Now don't get me wrong, it's not like the way 'requiem for a dream' is uncomfortable to watch it's the fact that it's played straight makes him so unsettling. As in this is not the Jack Nicholson or Jared Leto over the top super villians versions...this is a man suffering from severe mental illness turning psychotic and it's grounded in reality. This version could happen. That's the unsettling thing. Enjoyed trying to keep an eye out for any DC comics history references. Shame on all the people complaining and trying to censor this movie by saying its dangerous and glorifying the villians. It does no such thing........and by the way.......... it's just a movie.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Joaquin Phoenix killed it so good.,"The Joker is not a role model. He never was, never will be. His actions aren't justified, and neither were they right. But before the make-up and purple suit came on, before the blood-smirked smile formed shape, and before he got crowned as the Clown Prince of Crime, maybe the Joker was human. Maybe he was Arthur. And Joaquin Phoenix as joker and this movie makes us feel for him.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Amazing,"After seeing the trailer my hopes were sky high and, because of that, I was a bit worried how it would turn out. But, now that I've seen it, I can gladly say it did NOT disappoint. To be quite frank, it actually surprised me how raw and unsettling the movie is, even though I was expecting something around these lines. Joaquim is amazing the entire time, he's sad and depressed and you can watch the Joker growing inside him as the movie progresses. A few t√≠mes it feels over the top, like too many coicidences happening at once, but when compared with the greatness of everything else it just seems like nitpicking.
After the backlash this movie went through with the media and stuff, I'm thankfull it wasn't a disaster. 'Joker' is just as the movie itself, a survivor in a clown world. Go see for yourself, it's a dark take on a great villain, and it doesn't let you down.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"Braced for something else, but its about class warfare","""Joker""
Portrays mental illness in a society about to explode with the divisions between haves and have-nots. I expected a movie like ""The Stand"".
This was better, like a disguise in title.....
Depressing in the beginning, it slowly builds understanding and perhaps sympathy of the focal character. It has definite ""A Clockwork Orange"" feel to it. Similar in dysfunction, similar in ultra violence.

Joker,One of the greatest films I have ever seen,"So i have seen it twice now with a heavy probability of going a few more if im being honest here.Its haunting, its brilliant, its tragic, its beautiful, its funny, its dark, its sad, its funny...its Joker.We have finally been blessed with every iteration of the joker their is. From the clown and the gangster, to the anarchist and the unhinged, but now we finally have the madman and the showman. Phoenix brought everything to this performance and with Phillips crafted a Joker thats elegant and chilling. Both times I have seen it I have walked away with more questions and more theories. But theres a grace in Phoenixs performance. A dance. He glides through these scenes
In a way i thought no actor would do with the joker. Its beautiful and painful and a pure expression of the soul. The bathroom scene alone...awestriking. (not a spoiler its in the trailer) Phoenix has done it folks. Ledger would be so proudI cant remember the last time i have seen a movie this good. Elements of the godfather, taxi driver, king of comedy, the killing joke, the dark knight/the dark knight returns, mark hamil, a clockwork orange, requiem for a dream, one flew over the cuckoos nest, psycho, silence of the lambs...the list goes on.The MUSIC and the cinematography are truly some of the best I had ever seen. You are left powerlessly mystified by Phoenix and Phillips dedication to the project.
Its a masterpiece in every sense of the word
Nothing in the last year or hell the last decade even TOUCHES how great this movie is...Its not for everybody thats for sure, its a stiff drink to swallow.I remember everybody being surprised when i said Endgame was not the comic book movie i was waiting for in 2019. I knew there was something special about this movie when i saw the screen test.
Never in my life would I think a movie like this would exist...but it does....and people are starting to notice...",0
Joker,"A beautiful, unique representation of a different type of Joker.","I walked into the cinema with high hopes and I left completely fulfilled. I'm a massive Batman fan - both in comics, movies and television - and I was eager to see this latest iteration. I've enjoyed many portrayals of the Joker, from Nicholson to Ledger to Hamill. Each one showcases a different element of the Joker.Joaquin manages to present another side, whilst drawing from many aspects of the previous iterations. He plays on the mental side, showcasing a Joker developed out of circumstance. I feel Ledger's ambiguous Joker worked fantastically - which left you querying his reasons and mentality. This Joker is outright - you know his motivations and the film is a rollercoaster depicting that journey. He's a broken man with the weight of the world becoming overbearing - his fantasies so real that when they come crashing down with reality even I could sympathise with him.The art, setting and location were fantastic. Gotham felt real and dangerous, exactly as I'd picture a pre-Batman Gotham. The depiction of Thomas Wayne felt unique in that he was depicted more as a Trump-style capitalist rather than benevolent philanthropist although as his depiction is from the perspective of Arthur, it's possible he may not be as bad as depicted.I get the criticism based around the violence and how it utilises mental illness - it's very much topical and given recent and past events it was always going to dip into controversy. But I feel that it will be appreciated more once it settles. It is perhaps the ""Killing Joke"" of Joker movies.",0

But what struck me so hard is the acting, especially Joaquin Phoenix. I don't see him at all on the screen, Joaquin is totally disappeared. All I see is Joker, a character so complex and so real. From the legs shaking, sometimes hands tapping down to the way his eyebrow raising, it's a perfect Joker.Now that the movie has ended, so is Joker.

Joker,Marmite film,"First review I've ever done on iMdB but I have to say this to everyone, this film is a marmite film; people will either love it or hate it.Many people will go in with the expectations of being on-par with The Dark Knight, but these two films are completely incomparable in their own right.The Dark Knight is a COMIC film, it involves all the action and all the pieces of comic stories put into an action masterpiece, and Heath Ledger's performance is extraordinary as the clown prince of crime.Joker is an extremely disturbing, dark yet invigorating film which shines the light less on the impact of Bruce Wayne and the Joker's battle with one another - it instead showcases an ill mans descent into madness, and shows how his past-experiences have effected him throughout his troubled life. Personally, I think if they moved away from some of the DC-orientated parts of the film it would've been better, but.. it is a film about THE JOKER.Overall I am absolutely amazed with Joaquin Phoenix's performance, it is truly Oscar-Winning and his portrayal consists mainly of the characters ill-nature rather than a complete psychopath.Should you go and see this film? YES.
But don't compare it to The Dark Knight, this film is not an action film, it is a gripping thriller and a dramatic masterpiece.",0

It is by far the finest characterisation in modern cinema - Phoenix is utterly brilliant, every second of every minute he is on screen.3. You can't help but think with the world in such a precarious state, this is a dangerous film. The usual random, motiveless or opportunistic portrayal of crime is replaced with a narrative that draws empathy and support. The things that underpin the characters development happen in real life, in every city, in every country, the world over. Joker dares to suggest there is an alternative and lays out the blueprint.Enjoy the film, it is truly a masterpiece but don't be surprised if clowns become popular again. üòÄ",0

Joker,Phoenix has took the Joker to another level. THE HYPE IS REAL.,"When the initial teaser trailer came out, 6 months ago or however long it may be, I was skeptical of this take on the ""Joker"". The final trailer for it intrigued me massively, and I thought wow, this actually looks pretty good. Then the initial reviews came out, the fact it had gotten a standing ovation in 8 minutes, surely it is all hype? Surely it isn't THAT good?Boy was I wrong, Joker is a tremendous film, that is what sets it apart from other ""comic"" movies, this is not a great movie based on a comic character, it is a great film overall, period. Phoenix' acting is utterly stupendous, breathtaking, and worthy of an Oscar no doubt. The movie itself is dark, disturbing, gritty, and uncomfortable at times, and leaving the cinema, this is one of the rare movies which made me think about what I had seen in a deep manner. Can't wait to watch it again.Joker. 10 stars. Masterclass. Phenomenal.",0

The hype around this film was completely justified loved the screenplay, storytelling the emotions the acting I'm beyond amazed What an actor this Man is Joaquin has absolutely Nailed the JOKER. Showed us what the Joker as a character is all about. Heath Ledger's Joker was vastly developed in retrospect to the Criminal world while Joaquin Phoenix's Joker showed the beginning of how he actually became a psychopathic killer.

Joker,Worth seeing - It kept me at awe the whole time,"This movie was extremely good. One of those actor driven movies made in very good taste. No constant shaky cameras, no short-hand cut scenes, no bad CGI and a lot of pure breathtaking moments (more in the second part of the movie).I usually don't give a 10, but this movie deserves every praise it can get.

Joker,Masterpiece !,"The acting, screenplay, cinematography and music are just something worth of a top 10 all time. The movie is dark and powerful with each sequence bringing more and more emotions and mixed feelings. The Joker character is simply unreal, I don't think even a crazy person can act better than Joaquin did in this representation. He's acting is so powerful that makes you really think and have mixed judgements about him. It was simply a masterpiece in terms of acting. I've seen all the Joker representations so far and I can definitely say this one is the best one, the most powerful and authentic one. Some of the scenes are also so well directed that literally give a shake on the inside, where you go like ""wtf just happened"" ! If this movie doesn't receive an oscar for best actor, directing, screenplay and music, there is something wrong right there.That scene on the stairs, the depth with those 2 agents sitting at the top, him putting a perfectly crazy dance, the music aligned with it.

Joker,FANTASTIC,"Joker (2019) delivers a masterclass of acting by Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck and tells a deep and meaningful narrative in relation to society today. Joaquin Phoenix allows the audience to not only understand and empathise with the character 'Joker', but to also feel repulsed by some of the extreme actions he takes. When critics compare it to Heath Ledger, or downplay Joaquin Phoenix's character as an incel or angry white guy, they are sorely mistaken and most likely misunderstood the narrative of the film. Heath Ledger's Joker was a brilliant take on the character but you must understand that the 2019 Joker is introduced in a more psychologically engaging manner, where we are able to directly see Arthur's life before he became the joker. Whereas in the Dark Knight, the audience is only able to see the Joker post origin. If you think about it, the Dark Knight's joker has had many years to perfect his violent strategies, but Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is quite literally about the beginning of he Joker and what caused it.Put it simply, comparing the two Jokers would be unnecessary and irrelevant as they are focusing on the character in completely different parts of their lives.
No need to attack the film because it felt uncomfortable and real, this film was designed with that in mind and to make the audience think long and hard about the society they live in, including mental illness in contemporary society.",0
Joker,A Masterpiece,"First of all get this man an Oscar because he certainly deserves it . Man the movie was much more than I expected, after the movie ended the entire audience showed a wonderful applause because as I mentioned it's a Masterpiece . Screw all the haters saying that this movie is too violent , I admit there might be some slightly terrifying scenes but there is nothing that terrifying to leave the movie . I'm 16 years of age and I have seen much more mental and violent movies than this . I wanna thank Tod Phillips for bringing this Masterpiece to life and I hope he'll keep making more amazing movies like this in the near future . Thank you Joaquin Phoenix for bringing the joker each and everyone desperately needed .1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,"Grey, gritty and nightmarish","Joaquin pheonix's JOKER is a gritty and nightmarish character study of Travis Bickle-esque ""Arthur fleck"" aka the JOKER who descends into madness for personally justifiable reasons.The film does draw inspirations from Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING of COMEDY but it's nothing like any of them. Its actually gives us a more deeper look at Travis bickle from TAXI DRIVER.Now, let's talk about the Joaquin Pheonix..of course I can't confine my admiration for him just to an IMDB review but anyway. Joaquin's performance is absolutely brilliant, menacing and terrorizing as the JOKER. He totally gives you the creeps. Having said this, although his portrayal of the character is brutally violent towards the finish, the intentional slow burn of the film gives you enough time to know him that you can't help but empathize with the character at least in some darkest corner of your mind.Who played it best: for this I'd say until Heath ledger terrified the world with his brilliant performance in the dark Knight we couldn't think of anybody else who could play it like jack nicholson and he undoubtedly superceded jack Nicholson's portrayal in the 1989 BATMAN.And now with JOKER Joaquin undoubtedly inherited the throne Heath left.üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
Only if he were alive Heath would have lauded Joaquin's performance.thats how it works in any art form. There can be no ABSOLUTES what so ever. Ever body contributes to the medium.So i'd say kudos to Jack, Heath and JOAQUIN FREAKING PHEONIXTodd Philips I thank you so much for giving us such a great movie about the character we all love.I so so wish Matt Reeves considers Joaquin to play the joker in his upcoming Batman film if at all he plans to have a Joker in the film.Make way for GOTHAM'S new Clown Prince of Crime.",0

Joker,i wasnt happy not for a minute in my hole life. genius,"A combination of three top movies taxi driver, king of comedy and the six senses. those who appreciate Avengers movies will be disappointed. if you are under the age of 30 you should not go because you will not understand it and will not like it because joker has no superpowers. an interesting scenario full of realism that I haven't seen for many years and I didn't think Americans would do. I bet he'll win the Oscar. the problem is that those who appreciate real dramas (say almost the movie is inspired by real facts) will not go to this movie thinking it's fantasy as batman. comparing the notes given on imdb by Americans and the smaller notes given by Romanians shows the degree of culture between us and them. when it is a superficial movie like Avengers full of cartoons we give bigger notes than them.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Joker,Masterpiece,"This movie is a pure depiction of how a masterpiece looks like. Joaquin Phoenix have nailed the character of Joker. He doesn't only act from his expressions but also from his body. When Joker kills everybody, somewhere inside you know that this is not morally correct, but when you think about the sorry state of affairs with Arther Fleck, you somehow sympathize with him. That's where this movie gets into your nerves. Every single frame of this movie is a masterpiece. It shook my mind so big that I'm talking about this movie since last 3 days. The climax will blow up your mind. This movie screams for a sequel out of itself. How the society these days are not well behaved. People with mental illness finds themselves so lonely because this society never accept them. Rather they abuse them, to their limits. That's where some kind of Joker like character comes out. This movie makes you believe that there is a possibility of a Joker in this society. The society which abandons a loner and treats him like a trash. A man who was never happy in his entire life. A man who finds himself in between a kind of identity crisis. Words are less to describe how good Joaquin Phoenix has portrayed the clown prince of crime. This is the epitome of cinematic art. BRILLIANT!",0
Joker,Masterpiece,"Joker is absolutely truthfully a masterpiece. The acting, the screenplay, the tone, the character development, the music is just outstanding.

Joker,A must read review for a must view film,"I watched JOKER with superhero trepidation.As a stout Marvel fan and and having been somewhat let down by the promise that DC were going darker following Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (killings aside), I entered the theatre wondering what kind of picture Warner brothers would present.Some of the adverts prior to the movie were drol√© and tried to replicate the suggested horror and intrigue that would be presented in the film, but the copycats fell short of the truth.
Joker presents a dark and intrepid insight into the origins of one of DC's most fabled villains.
The acting by Phoenix was sublime and the setting held true to the history of the character and the references to the origins of batman were there to be seen.I do not want to dwell much on the story of the film as it would detract and deter some from witnessing this visual extravaganza and performance, and to surmise Joaquin Phoenix gives his soul to this homage and becomes truly encapsulating.
To bring this into modern context, it is a man who suffers from mental illness who loses his right to help from the government due to budget cuts whilst the over pompous capitalists drink champagne, ride in limo's and sleep in mansions whilst profiting from the lesser man. Much of this is only hinted at however and bares little influence to the piece as The Joker is not a political figure until he emerges from his metamorphis, which only occurs following a dramatic event - and this itself only happens near the end of the film.Phoenix depicts a truly delirious, deep, and troubled character haunted by the events of his family life which have echoed into his present and in some ways dictate his behavior's such as his memorable, yet haunting, uncontrollable laugh - which is well characterized in the movie.
There are a lot of comments regarding mental impairments and how this movie should have been a higher classification - but having looked at the BBFC category wording it neither dwells on any particular situation nor glorifies it - however it is a deep portrayal of a troubled and well know (sic) super villain and in the film there are at least 2 somewhat contentious moments so watch at your own {peril}.This film in my view, has been released at the most appropriate time. The world is waking up to the fact that fat cats (which include movie stars) are milking the lesser man (sic) as the societal gaps widens between rich and poor and this real life occurrence is well represented in this film.",0

Joker,An astonishingly brilliant movie with a sledgehammer performance by Phoenix.,"Just saw this movie today in the cinema and my god what a hell of a film this is. Taking place in 1981, we are introduced to the origin of The Joker in all his dark, gritty, violent, psychotic glory. The transformation of Arthur Flecks character is ground breaking. we see this poor, misunderstood man mercilessly beaten multiple times before finally lashing out taking his first steps towards becoming this infamous villain we love so much getting deeper and progressively more intense and violent as the film goes on. There are a couple moments in this film that some might find hard to watch but it's seriously not as bad as what everyone's been saying about it. in saying that, this is definitely not a film for kids.Anyone who is familiar with the Batman films will know well and truly that Bruce Wayne's (Batman's) parents are murdered in front of him in an alley way when he's still only a young boy. This film shows this event and the events leading up to it. In terms of the overall timeline of events, Joker begins roughly 3 weeks before Bruce Wayne's parents are killed.Joker carries a very dark, stylish theme just like so many batman movies have done before it. the score, cinematography and the astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix are some of the biggest impacts a film has had on me over the last decade. We also have some strong political messages on display here too which I will not delve into here. Leave that for the forum sites =)Joker is one truly amazing film and is sure to go down as an all time masterpiece. 10 out of 10.",0

All I have to say is this film is brilliant, disturbing, and of course tragic. Joaquin Phoenix brings an Oscar worthy performance throughout the whole movie as we follow his descent into madness. The soundtrack by Hildur Gudnadottir is a masterstroke, giving you this sense of sadness and horror as it plays throughout the film. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is absolutely stunning showcasing Arthur's world as ugly, fractured, yet strangely beautiful. And finally, the direction of Todd Phillips, along with his screenplay with Scott Silver, bring all of these elements together to portray a haunting tale of how a man with a fragile mindset can be turned into a monster by an unforgiving and corrupt society which won't be forgotten anytime soon.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Legacy links to Wayne's, Bruce and the death of Thomas created a real connection to all the stories we have watched before. I just hope the next Batman movie supersedes this - and a Batman & Joker movie is a MUST.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Go see this movie with your own eyes. Do not trust the critics,"I was one of the few people who did not have much thought about the movie when I saw the first trailers. I did not expect it to be great or bad, I knew it was a Joker origin story, and that is about it. I had seen the Killing Joke animated movie and I immediately knew what I was getting into.
The movie was a perfect work of art that you can easily see fit in to the 1980s or with a few adjustments in the present or the Dark Knight trilogy as a spinoff.Joaquin Phoenix brings this character to life and you buy it so well because you understand what he experienced or why he goes down the dark path. He looks great as a either characters and you see the slow transformation.Finally the critics and the media are slamming this movie for being a celebration of evil. It's a lie and an intentional misdirection to get clicks on their videos or news sites. It is completely not. If this movie is a celebration of evil, then Deadpool is the month long celebration of violence and degradation because that movie kills people because it's fun and comedic. It is a disgrace how much the media and the critics bent backward to critic this movie just because it accurately portrays violent groups.

Joker,A reflection on Mob Culture and Mental illness,"After watching it, the reason why the PC SJW ruling class of Hollywood hated it was crystal clear to me. The movie depicts an Antifa-like mob destroying the city, clashing with the police, totally resentful and picking on regular citizens. Anarchists, they have always been. They're not into justice or equality, they wanna wreck things as if life was nothing but a joke. Mob rules Gotham and Antifa rules Portland. Arthur Fleck is the cathalizer. I wonder, if the movie was about a deeply perturbed woman, who inspired havoc amongst citizens, would it be condemned as this movie has been or would have been held as empowering and brave?1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Masterpiece üëå,"Todd Phillips gave us the best version of our favorite villain that we related to.
The character build up was full of emotions of empathy and rage that will last with you after you leave the cinema hall!Joaquin Phoenix hit us hard with his phenomenal performance. He made us feel uncomfortable, miserable, angry and we showed empathy.
It was uneasy at all going through this all.And the master scene he gave us when he draw a smile on his face out of his blood was perfectüëå.
I only wished to see more of the joker in the movie especially that Joaquin has the most similar features to the joker in the comic books and in our minds.Eventually this movie will leave you full of emotions of empathy and rage that will last with you after you leave the cinema hall!",0
Joker,Makes a great character study and executes a brilliant film.,"Not only is this a great comic book movie, it's a great movie, by all standards. One that would come in the 70s , looking like it, acting like it, by the biggest hits of it's cinematic output. This is not a pleasant movie to sit through. It depicts a persons slip from sanity in a way that makes you go from fearing for him to those who oppose him. Not in a way the celebrates these vile acts he commits. It knows the tragedy of the character, and uses it to create a genuinely impactful character study and form a cationary tale around it.Though it was questioned rather comedy director Todd Phillips would be able to bring the chops needed for such a story. Such worries are moot, once the brutal grittyness, the nastyness the visaeral execution of these things play out. It's well as well, moving in a slow burn to bursts, akin to the characters own mind, before it snaps at the end.Carrying this all is Phaqin Penoix, who is meanicing, unnerving, yet with a dose of fun and sympathy. He's creepy to watch and owns every scene, carrying the whole film as it's star. A film that is deserving of praise , makes you think, creates uncomfortable questions, and executes it's intentions valiantly. This one is a keeper every film buff should see.",0
Joker,A perfect ode to Heath Ledger,"KNOCK KNOCK! Joker is one such exceptional film which gets the perfect balance of staying noir & elevating empathy for the protagonist.
The film delves with oppression, the oppressed from the first frame, and it becomes very evident, the journey of the protagonist will take a downward curve in the graph to bring out the change in the society, unfortunately resulting in anarchy.
The film never tries to pretend intelligent, and it plays well within the dramatics, not getting drifted away. There are some real beautiful scenes which brings out how oppressed the protagonist is and that too with his signature laugh, you feel for the character, you want to hoot for him to succeed, and you realise the actions by the protagonist to resolve the main conflict is not justified, and the filmmaker is careful not to glorify his actions rather smartly diverts us into the psyche of the protagonist as defense mechanism.
Joaquin Phoenix gives us a crackling performance, enacting the Joker himself, every scene- the laugh, the stare, the helplessness has been so consistent, that one would expect him to succeed for his dream of becoming a standup comedian and come out of this pity. This is a perfect ode to Heath Ledger, he would have been so happy to see this amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
Lastly, the film beautifully portrays the real Joker on screen yet again, where his jokes are as subjective as his actions.
This film gives an urge to watch Heath Ledger's version of Joker.
Highly Recommended! Don't miss it!",0
Joker,I hated it but couldn't stop watching,I can't even explain this you literally just need to go watch. I absolutely hated how he was treated in his marginalisation by society and at one point (subway scene) I was crying because my heart hurt for him.

Joker,Exceeded my expectations. A brilliant movie. Probably the best in its genre.,"This movie was so colourful but dark at the same time. It looks absolutely beautiful. I believe DC has been trying to make their movies gritty, serious and dark. But it never worked with the way they attempted in the past few years. It was very diffrent from what DC has been trying for years, you know... they make the colours, the athmosphere all gross and stuff, the story is always the same with the big bad unstoppable godly villain.This was such a diffrent experience. Entertaining and effective. It had a really interesting and kinda confusing story too. It was hard to watch at times and some scenes actually made me uncomfortable. How they managed to write Joker is astounding. The isolation and the struggles he faces are told is exciting.This is the best movie I saw this year. It deserves the hype. I love this movie, it surprised me. I am proud of DC. I hope they write movies as good as this. Maybe even better ones, if possible. This might be the start of a new era for superhero movies. At least I hope it is.",0

Joker,Simply outstanding!,"I don't understand the negative reviews and Metacritic score. I think these critics need to come down from their pathetic self-centered high grounds and see the movie for what it is: an outstanding piece of art the likes of which are produced very rarely. This coming from a person who has seen thousands of movies from across timelines and across cultures. It should get at least 5 Oscar noms and win at least three. If Joaquin Phoenix does not get Best Actor Oscar then the Academy deserves a visit by Arthur Fleck!. Definitely among the 10 best ever from any country and any language.

Joker,The Clown Prince of Crime is born!,"Yesterday, I went to watch the Joker, and I have to say that the film was absolutely brilliant. It has genuinely put a positive smile on my face! Joaquin Phoenix's performance, the overall storyline, along with how the film was put together is completely worth watching.As the Joker is a standalone film from the current list of DC films, it was refreshing to see a bold, dark and gritty attempt to deeply witness Arthur transform into one of the world's most notorious comic book villain. I would like to go in depth about his transition, but it is something the viewers need to watch for themselves. For me, this is one of the reasons why I enjoyed this film - it is not just about the Joker being a psychopath, but it is about understanding Arthur's circumstances, as well as his perspective about life.In terms of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker, I really enjoyed his take on the character, and his version is currently my favourite. The insanity and brutal stance (attitude) of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is just mind-blowing, and this film gives us an opportunity to see an untamed and extreme Joker in a live action film.This film does contain some shocking, violent, along with gruesome scenes, and this is to be expected with a character like the Joker. He is not the clown you invite to your child's birthday party for an amusing experience. Looking back at the film, certain scenes were not even that horrific, and critics and individuals are unnecessarily attacking this film. There are other films and TV shows that are much more aggressive than the Joker.If you are yet to watch the film, go and see it without overthinking it. The hype that was within the trailers, expands throughout the film. It is that good. The Joker is a one of a kind film, and Todd Phillips has shown us what is possible for mature, in depth and dark comic book films.",0

Joker,Best cinematic achievement of the decade,"This Joker was a masterpiece. The way Todd Phillips unfolds the tragic story of Arthur Fleck is a piece of cinema that can only be explained by emotion. The essence in which the Joker as a character is warped and distorted to be the award winning, no doubt, performance of Joaquin Pheonix is truly exceptional and outstanding. From the mis en scene to the minor green tint throughout the whole movie, each frame is to be cherished by the audience. Todd Philips should be internationally recognised and applauded for his story telling in Joker. If you emphasise for a villain who has caused a whole city to riot and to murder, either you are sick, or Philips' creation has been successful. Heath ledger isn't comparable to how amazing and twisted this performance was. If I was to recommend any movie, it'd be 2019s shock film Joker. Physiologically thrilling and heart throbbingly emotional at the same time, this movie has made 5 stars in my opinion.

His unreliable narration was really engaging and I felt constantly on edge.Perhaps this film glorifies violence in the way that every action film does. This is a film about the Joker, there's going to be violence and depictions of mental health, which in my opinion were grounded in realism. I don't see people complaining about John Wick, The bourne identity, James Bond, the godfather, pulp fiction, goodfellas, American Psycho, kill bill, django unchained etc etc. I get the point but I dont see how its any different in this movie than the rest.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Getting a storyline has always been hard for DC, the mixed timelines and the inconsistent story and bouncing between characters has always been a downer. The one character that has always made DC a success was Joker. And this film has lived up to it's name.
The screenplay is one of the best in the recent times. Joaquin phoenix has lived as the Joker entirely. The transformation of Arthur Flex to The Joker, the penultimate movie of the entire DC cinematic universe. It's a must watch for everyone who wishes to side with the Joker.

Joker,Spoiler Free review,"Heath Ledger will probably always be my favorite rendition of The Joker, because of the charisma and intelligence he brought to the role.
With that said, I don't think anyone could have played this version of the Joker except for Joaquin Phoenix. He did things with the character, both through physicality of acting and through emotional depths, that both amazed and hurt me.
The movie is most definitely a drama and something of a personal journey of horror. It does not, as was my fear and the voiced concerns of many others, demonize everyone with a mental illness, or give justification for the incels and Red Pill Society members and MRA's to be terrible human beings. Neither does it say ""Hey if you're alone and nobody likes you you can fix your problems with a little random violence."" Instead, it shows us a plethora of factors, and a variety of nudges, that cause someone who's already struggling with who they are in life, and whether or not they actually even exist, to take a dark path. Joker shows us that those with mental illnesses, the 'clowns', the people considered broken or invisible or worthless by society as a whole, are being consistently let down by the system, at every turn. And Phoenix, and the writers, do an incredible job of showing us that The Joker is *human*. He's not some criminal mastermind, not at this point; he's very much figuring things out as he goes, and the film takes care to point out several times that the Joker is not making a political statement with his actions; he's not trying to enact sweeping change, or smash the Patriarchy, or fight The Man; he's just done with everyone's shit, and with how he feels the world is treating him. The movie doesn't have a lot of violence, but when it does it is brutal, harsh and quick; and it explores the ripple effects those violent acts cause.I found this to be an incredible film. I didn't come away from it feeling like it blamed those with mental issues or trauma; The Joker was very much responsible for his own actions, just as we all are. But it definitely helped remind me that underneath the makeup, there was still a human being in there, and it definitely made me analyze my feelings on the interactions between Batman and the Joker over the years.If you see this movie, expect to cry (I teared up several times) and to feel awkward; they do an excellent job of overextending an awkward situation until it becomes almost unbearable. Also, they somehow manage to be predictable without being boring; the predictability instead turns into a slow build of dread, because you can see where something is going a mile off, and then you're still along for the unavoidable end. And this movie is an R for a lot of language, and some fairly brutal violence.
It is not a movie that leaves you feeling good at the end, but it is one I am glad I went to see, and I hope that they tap Phoenix for the Joker in a future movie; he can clearly find that character's depths.",0

Joker,"Not just a great comic book movie, a great movie period!","After Jared Leto's letdown performance as the character in 2016's Suicide Squad, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance of The Joker since the late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight!This film is a self contained story that doesn't draw heavily off of any one comic book story, though there are little nods to the comics, such as The Wayne Family/a young Bruce Wayne playing a prominent role in the movie, plus subtle nods to The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns.It's in a dark, gritty world that the film takes place, as we are taken back to 1981 and we're transported to a Gotham City unlike any we've seen before on film, a city not unlike our real world. It's a Gotham City on the edge of chaos, and Phoenix's Arthur Fleck/Joker is the catalyst that throws the switch, as the people of Gotham begin to riot against the elite and upper class of the city and regard The Joker as a folk hero and Robin Hood type of figure. The film has major echoes of past 80s films, such as Taxi Driver and Dog Day Afternoon.It's within this gritty realism that the stakes of the movie takes place. Phoenix's portrayal of this mentally unstable man, whom society has turned it's back on, is both frightening and relatable. As his mental faculties begin to unravel, the viewer can't help but sympathize in some way with The Joker's plight. He's pained by what he's suffered in life, but he goes off the deep end into a life of crime. That's what makes Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the character so frightening. More than any other incarnation of the character, this one has echoes of our real world: that nothing is more frightening than a mentally unstable person with a gun.But it also leaves The Joker's backstory up in the air and up for debate by the end of the film, as Arthur/Joker is an unreliable narrator, and the audience is left wondering what exactly in the film's narrative was the truth and what were just delusions in The Joker's head.It's a film that transcends genres. It's not just a great comic book based film, it's a gritty, dark, and brilliantly done character study. It's a movie with real world consequences, as the characters are very reflective of the criminals that plague the news every day.An absolutely stunning performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the movie definitely is worth every amount of acclaim it's getting! Phoenix deserves an Oscar! It's a brilliant piece of film!!",0
Joker,Best movie of the 21st century,"From the moment the movie started, it was dark and it got darker which each segment. Over the years we have gotten full fledged jokers never an origin where we actually get to see why he became joker. I'm really glad mr phillips took up the mantle in doing this film because we really needed a change from the campy, over the top, predictable, cheesy and kid friendly cbm's we've been getting esp. from marvel. You do have people out there who are interested in serious contents that challenges one's belief. This movie isn't glorifying killing or incels it shows you how society can help shape disenfranchise individuals. The fact that critics are outraged over this, has led me to be believe the director has achieved his motive(by creating a thought provoking film). The critics are proving todd's and joker's point about society. This is top tier movie and DEFINITELY one of the best movies ever made esp. in the 21st century. The best movie of the year.....It's right up there with Dark Knight if not better.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0

Joker,Mum Threw Away My Nintendo,"This movie resonated with me on a whole new level. We live in a society where gamers are expected to endure under the authoritarian subjugation of our society. Where SJWs consider gaming a mental illness and try to repress our battle cries. GAMERS, RISE UP. Veronica... you could've been my queen. You were fearless, crazier than me, you could've been my queen and god help anyone who'd disrespect my queen. I could've shared this revolution with you... but you friend zoned me 10 times... 10 TIMES VERONICA WHEN WILL YOU LEARN TO LOVE ME, A GENTLEMAN GAMER, INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER DUMB JOCKS!!!

Joker,Epic & Poetic,"This movie is different. Different from average comic movies, adventures, dramas or thrillers.
It's not only a new perspective to the Joker, the world of Batman or DLC.
It's a music poet to in psychiatric illness, in sick society, in evil, in darkness of human soul.
A new way to make drama oe thriller movies.
A deep epic movie that leaves you with a scary laugh at the end, just like joker's.
joaquin phoenix is the actor of the year and with Robert De Niro & Tod Philips give us one of the best movies in history of cinema & pop culture.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",0
Fifty Shades of Grey,What the hell just happened?,"Dear God! Why am I doing this to my self? Why? Why did I let my friends convince me to do this? This was a two-hour painful experience, but I should have been expecting this, because I have been going through the book last summer. In a few words: Pointless. Meaningless. Worst acting ever. Screenplay with no actual significance. But the target of the producers was achieved: They made me go and see this thing. Best highlight of the movie, the end credits. I only wish there was a ""The End"" title. I would stand up and give it an ovation. PS: If there is someone that still has not seen this, make yourself a favor and stay home. Better wash your dishes. Stitch some old panties. Clear out your collection of old stamps. See which hat suits you best.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Total waste of time,"I have read the book and I totally loved it. Then they said, a movie will be coming. Fans were really excited. It's Christian Grey! Duh! Then the casts were told. Then it lose my anticipation, but still I waited for the damn movie, hoping they can get the best out of those people.Tadah! No love story. Just porn. Jamie Dornan can be a real sexist y' know. But Dakota Johnson's acting was the worst I've seen. Sorry, not sorry.THIS REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME.

SO glad I only wasted my time putting the movie in my Netflix queue then wasted an hour or so watching it.I don't see how they thought they could take a series...that was written over three books and turn it into a movie.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Don't go see this,"I actually think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Its well shot with okay acting but ultimately just what it was originally supposed to be; Twilight fanfiction. It has an extremely weak female ""protagonist"" and very little to offer for anyone looking for an interesting film. Don't even bother watching it because that gives it slightly higher chance of becoming a sequel and that would be another terrible movie. And when it comes down to it, people went for the sex which, and even that shows that Anastasia character is weak and totally submissive to the man. Its truly sexism at its worst. These aren't role models and honestly this film should have been shut down a long time ago. This movie actually had nothing interesting or entertaining in it.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,I expected so.much.more,"I have read the books and expected so much more from this movie.The film missed essential KEY points of the book that set up the relationship between the two main characters, and then goes on to miss even more important character building points, barely skimming the important drama inducing details that where needed.I was so disappointed and left with a very deflated 'blah' feeling. I wanted to leave before mid-point but made myself suffer through the holes left in the story.I do not feel compelled to see the 2nd and 3rd titles, the new director/screen writer will have their work cut out for them in trying to recover from this absolute FLOP.I would be more detailed, but the only spoiler alert anyone needs for this movie is... DON'T WATCH IT.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I read the books, which were 50 shades of awful. I did not go see the movie at the theater because I am still angry at myself for shelling out my hard earned money on the some of the most poorly written drivel in the history of the earth. When the movie showed up on HBO, I figured ""okay, I'll pour myself a glass of wine and see if the movie is as bad as the books."" Sadly, I convinced my husband to watch with me (he's still not speaking to me). We made it about 30 minutes into the movie when I said ""I give! I can't take it! This is soooo bad! I'd rather watch Family Guy! (btw... I hate Family Guy)"" At this point, my son points out there is a video on YouTube ""50 Shades of Grey in 18 minutes"" or something like that. We cue that up and let me tell you, it was infinitely more pleasurable to watch. At least we were laughing where you are suppose to laugh. Plus, the narrator is much more interesting than Dakota Johnson's ""Anastasia Steele"" or Jamie Dornan's ""Christian Grey"".If you are looking for a great laugh or maybe a movie to turn into a drinking game, see 50 Shades. If you value your intelligence, don't waste your time.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Just Horrible, Waste of Time","This movie was very disappointing to say the least. I read all of the books. I certainly wasn't expecting an Oscar worthy performance but at least some entertainment value after the long wait for this movie to come out. This movie was just plain bad and not the kind of bad that you want to keep watching. I actually didn't see it in the theatre but waited for it to be on cable, so I watched it for free, so glad I didn't waste my money! At least I got some work done on my computer while watching it on my couch and didn't completely waste my time. There is seriously no chemistry between the 2 characters which is the biggest flaw in this movie. To make matters worse, the acting and dialogue were dreadful as well. Unfortunately I can't think of anything positive about this movie, it was difficult and uncomfortable to watch. I can't believe they are making another one!0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Really Bad!,"I really wanted to like this movie. I have not read the book so I was sure I would like it better than those who were disappointed because #notmychristian or something like that.I don't understand how anyone thought this would be sexy. I have seen sexier on Television Series shows that showed less skin than this one.I think the main problem is with the selection of actors for the main characters. While I am REALLY SURE they would be awesome in other rolls, the main premise of this movie requires certain types of actors to pull it off.The script and directing were really horrible so I am not sure any actor could have made it work. And the ending???? Can anyone tell me what was supposed to be happening there? Did they just run out of film or were they actually trying to make a point??? I saw the unrated version on HBO. But, if I had paid good money to see this I would be demanding my money back for sure.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,horrible movie!,This movie contains very poor acting. It doesn't follow the book at all and leaves out important details about the relationship. All it shows is them having sex and emailing each other. Horrible movie and waste of money!!!! If you want details and read the book and skip the movie. It sucked! I cant saw enough how bad this movie was. The acting was awful and they had no connection. Will not be buying or seeing the next movies as I'd rather just read the books. Not sure why they picked the actors that they did but they didn't do a good job. The producer didn't do her job and let out loads of details and skip lots of parts of the book. She also didn't follow it at all and just did what she wanted.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Crap, crap, and even more crap","I have read all three fifty shades of Grey books, and I absolutely LOVED them. But this movie? Not so much. It is missing WAY TO MANY small important details! I know this ain't uncommon for movies based on books, but this was just awful. When I watched the movie, it wasn't even close to be near the book. I was expecting a movie, that went somewhat, along with the books. But no, just no. The movie was awful, if I didn't know the title, I wouldn't even know, it was fifty shades of Grey. This is my second time watching it. The first time, I turned it off after just 5 minutes. I just couldn't handle how awful it was, and still is. But I thought, let's give it another chance. I wish I didn't. The only reason this movie even gets one star, is because of the beautiful scenery. The nature is absolutely beautiful, but the acting isn't....

Fifty Shades of Grey,I May Never Go To The Movies Again,"Have we really sunk this low? This is what's considered entertainment? Poor Tippi has to see her granddaughter splayed all over the screen! This nonsensical tale is so tasteless, not to mention un-erotic, it makes you wonder whether the entire human race has lost their brains. It'll put you into a 2-hour coma. Poorly acted. Inane dialog. Hey, nice scenery. Did they have to steal the giddy glider rendezvous from the remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair?"" Have they no imagination of their own? Can't think of any redeeming qualities here. Someone please clue me in. No, wait! Better off spending your time reading D. H. Lawrence if you're looking for a wee bit of titillation.

Fifty Shades of Grey,One of the worst movies ever made,"This is a truly disturbed and terrible film. There is no real plot but just some sadistic moments. Why didn't you just make a porno? This was almost everything short of a porno without any real story. Most of us are adult enough to watch nudity within a broader and coherent film. In this case we have cheap nudity that pretends to have a story. Someone as sick as the male lead would never be in charge of such a large company, large companies are run by actual busy and hardworking adults.The writer of these books must be truly disturbed to write such worthless filth. The director of this rubbish is even more disturbed to adapt these books that are not good enough for toilet paper into a film. What is bewildering is the number of women that are into it. The female psyche will forever be an unending mystery. People commenting on their figure is inappropriate but watching a sadist film with submissive sexuality at the female's expense is alright.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

My girlfriend enjoys this movie, but the difference between her and I is that I have taste when it comes to films.Romance certainly isn't my style when it comes to filmmaking, but this inexcusable piece of crap was just bad.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Top 5 Worst Endings Ever!,"Reviews aren't about telling you what the movie is about, you already know. What you should know is this movie was terrible. It started out OK, but went down hill. Grey isn't that hot and neither is Ana. The worst part of the film was the end. It was like driving over a cliff. It ended abruptly giving you no clue how it really ended. I don't want to assume an ending, I want to see it. My movie partner and I looked at each other at the same time and said, ""WTF""? The film would have been just OK if it had an ending, but since it didn't have one, I felt I wasted my time. Had I paid to see it, I would have been livid.

Fifty Shades of Grey,boring,"I am glad to see that I am not alone in my opinion. It is a bad script for a hard core porn while the porn is substituted with a cheesy erotica. There is no originality in the script at all - it is predictable and full of clich√©. It would be OK for a hard core porn, because the genre uses the script only as a sort of introduction. I can't imagine a person that could read the whole book without falling asleep at ... well, let's cut the book some slack, assuming the reader is drinking strong coffee... at 10th page. I don't know if we should blame the actors. I am under impression that they tried their best in the circumstance that they were put in by the script. The only thing that could save the movie would be treating it as a comedy, making fun of all those clich√©s.1 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,It takes nerve of steel to watch this half-porn sleazy skin show !!!,"The Twilight film series was popularized and blown-out-of-proportion by fans of the book and result was headache and melancholy associated with each twilight film. Fifty Shades Of Grey follows the same step which is saddened by over-the-top performance and lame script.The life of an internship student changes when she meets big-shot and mysterious business tycoon, Christian Grey.The trailer of Fifty Shades Of Grey, based on immensely popular book of same name written by E.L.James, was catchy and interesting but when you watch the film, you will be flabbergasted to watch half-porn sleazy skin show with no convincing moments enough to bring out the romance and feel good factor. In fact, the movie will remind you early Twilight series which had immature actors and worst direction. Screenplay is weak with no sense of storyline. Cinematography is good. Art direction is nice. Editing is loose. First time director Sam Taylor-Johnson gets ample scope to bring the falling pieces together but fails miserably with unconvincing plot. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, apart from looking good on-screen, still has long way to go in terms of acting. Other actors are pathetic. Songs are the only silver- lining in this boring flick.Overall, I felt it was a waste of my time, energy and money. Given a chance, I would have watched Whiplash again .Poor 1/5",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Nicely packaged nonsense, boring, insult to moviegoers","My quick rating - 4.0/10. Not gonna review,the movie is very boring. Steamy sex scenes? Nope. Acting you drawing you into a romance? Nope. A plot that wasn't a cookie cutter romance of the geeky girl gets the hot guy? Naw, that is exactly what it was. Redeeming quality? Even though it wasn't supposed to be a comedy, at times it didn't mean to be,it WAS actually funny. Didn't read the books but even those that did say this movie was just plain bad and did no justice, those that didn't read the book seem to flow the herd and follow the sheep into the field of fans saying the movie was good and NOW want to read the book. Kinda funny since those who read the book disliked the movie and those that liked the movie NOW want to read the book? Why, to find out how inferior the movie was? Basically the definition of following the herd.

Fifty Shades of Grey,I would rather watch paint dry.,"First of all let me say that I did read all three books a couple of years ago and I thought the books were OK. Unfortunately, the things that I enjoyed about the book, such as the development of the plot, were non-existent in the movie. Had I not read the books then I would have had no idea what was going on in the movie because the story was poorly told. Of the 4 or 5 sex scenes, I only enjoyed 2 of them. It's important that I point this out because the movie was centered around the sex. Honestly, the books were also centered around the sex but there were other layers that kept me interested. When I read the book I skipped through most of the sex because it was boring and redundant, and the same can be said for the movie. This was one of the most boring movies that I have seen in a long time. I knew that it was bad when couples started walking out of the theatre. I was tempted to walk out as well but I chose to stay because I wanted to see the ending that I had been hearing so much about. All in all, I was very disappointed.1 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Plain Awful Mess Of A Movie,"Well, why is this movie so terrible? Can we enumerate 50 reasons? No, it should look like this - 50 Shades Of Shame - 1. Boring, overlong, slow-pacing movie 2. No real chemistry between main 2 heroes 3. Rather boring soundtrack, with Beast Of Burden being the only redeeming feature 4. Absolutely underdeveloped characters that look more like school book sketches than real people 5. Absolutely unnecessary prolonged nudity scenes that are neither arousing nor passionate, but plainly uneasy and awkward 6. Very vapid emotional background - we cannot feel for the heroes, and both Grey and Anastasia are just cold, withdrawn, detached figurines 7. No real sexual appeal - yeah, Dakota is pretty, but her nudity leaves a very clumsy, almost ashamed air 8. Tedious talks - all those Contract issues seem so laughable and vapid that leave you deeply shocked 9. Over-pretentious seriousness. Only 2 times when Anastasia chuckled or giggled was that funny, the rest was a yawn 10. Well, even 10 points are too much for this banal, dry, silly piece of horror Not recommended to watch. Score - 0 out of 10 - The Worst Movie of 2015. Period",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,The most boring soft porn ever,"The movie reflects the awfulness of the book. My wife wanted to watch it, so I relented, and downloaded the movie from the net. There was no way in Hades I'd pay to watch this peace of manure in the movie theatre.So we settled in for an evening of soft porn watching, and what we got was a completely boring, uneventful peace of garbage, and two hours we could have been doing anything more interesting. Like watching the paint dry, or how the grass is growing.There were some so called ""hot sexual scenes"", which were taken right out of a very soft porn movie. Bland, and very boring script, and very bad acting.There was no chemistry between the actors, and the whole situation is completely unrealistic. The author of the book clearly shows her fantasies in her ""book"". She always wanted to be an ""innocent virgin"" and to be controlled in order to feel ""attractive and feminine"". Glorifying a socio-path, and an abusive relationship. She needs to see a psychiatrist, and not write a pamphlet that glorifies abuse.The really disturbing thing however is, how many females liked the book, and the movie. It shows the female mentality, and the lack of intellect and good taste. Some read the book for the fun of it, just to see what it is all about, that is OK I'd say. However, the ones that take it as serious literary master-peace that is pushing the boundaries, do not know what in the hell they are talking about.The fact of the matter is, that the actors destroyed their careers with this movie. I do hope, they will find jobs after this gross misjudgement on their part, when they took the roles in this thing called ""motion picture"".",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Unoriginal and bored me to death.,"As you can tell from most of the reviews below this film is basically a piece of horse s***, I went into this film expecting something pretty lame but honestly, it was 10 times worse then that. After about 30 minutes into this I suddenly realised this is quite literally Twilight, but just with lots of bondage. I admit it was a very well shot and lit film but the acting was very unconvincing and unrealistic. I wanted to care about Anna throughout this film but I honestly could not give two s***s. All I can say is I found it unbelievable on how this woman got so rich and famous for pulling off a more explicate and lame bondage type twilight fan fiction that is so poorly written and directed. The back story was not interesting, there was hardly any character development, and it is filled with some of the most cheesiest and lamest dialogue.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Grey Matter Not Detected,"This movie was simply awful. It's so awful that I now can't decide which I hate more, the book or the movie. Although the movie brought the book's characters to life, they were characters that were already hollow and distasteful, so actually seeing them on screen was an even bigger turn-off than reading about them in the books. On top of that, there was no chemistry between the two leads. I guess Jamie Dornan did a marginally better job than his female counterpart (Dakota Johnson) but being a decent actor in a crappy movie isn't really something to be proud of. Dakota Johnson, on the other hand, seemed to choose to portray her character from 2 alternating angles -- one minute she's obtuse, then another minute indifferent (almost bored, even). It's no wonder Christian Grey preferred spanking her, if only to evoke some sort of spirited or passionate reaction. If I were to ever know a person like Anastasia Steele (as she was portrayed by Dakota Johnson) in real life, I'd be inclined to think she was a little slow.My overall impression of the movie was that it tried too hard to be some form of classy softcore porno with unending sexual suggestions callously injected into almost every scene and dialogue. How does one try so hard yet fail so miserably? The movie trudged along too slowly then went around in circles without actually going anywhere.What were they thinking?!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Why?,"This movie is a smut-film. Nothing but a training video for those who think rape might be fun.Drunk males, flirty females.. this is not like real life. The production value is low, even though the budget was more than likely very high.Feminists must be grinding their teeth just knowing that this film is open for anyone to watch.My advice is to steer clear of this horrible film with absolutely no realism and values that even an animal wouldn't promote!1/10 Is the lowest score that I can give this film on this site.. but a 0/10 is more appropriate.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Beyond Terrible,This movie deserves no stars. I can not believe I waisted my time and money on this movie. The acting was dreadful and so was this story line. I read the book and it was appalling. There is not one thing sexy or even remotely attractive of Christian Grey. Anastasia Steele or Ana has zero sex appeal. Everything about this movie was abhorrent. Anyone who rates this movie a 10 are either getting payed to do so or have horrible taste in good movies/books. I can not even fathom why any one could think that this is sexy or a turn on because it is not. This movie has a 4.2 for gods sake that is all you need to know. I read other reviews that stated the only reason the movie was rated higher was because of the soundtrack which is true. As someone who had a little hope for this movie it let me down.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Worst movie I have watched in recent year,I generally do not write reviews for movie so please do not mind my language but after watching this movie I very much feel like making some comment about this movie and waste 5 more minutes out of my life.Firstly:I feel like I have just wasted 2 hours of time from my life. I gave it a 1 star since I could not give 0.Story:Just a regular story in which a guy falls for a girl they are in relation for some time.Later on girl finds that he is not good for her and leaves him.I felt sorry about the director and the actors for making such a worst movie.,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Pathetic, cheap way to fleece soccer moms (*)","The high point (or low, depending on how you see it) of my evening with Fifty Shades of Grey came when I slammed my fingers in a car door following the show. My shooting pain was coupled with a dose of adrenaline, followed by a not-so-subtle 'tingling' sensation. What a serendipitous event, for it was a stark contrast to what I just saw. The infamous novel-turned-film left me about as bewildered as one could possibly be after exiting a theater, but one thing was stark in its' clarity- when an injured middle finger creates more excitement than a film about sexual dominance and submissiveness, you're doing something wrong. Should not the 'global phenomenon' that is the novel be considered at least a little transcendent to be such a 'phenomenon'? Should not the stars of said 'phenomenon' be likable, or at least grab our attention? Should a film adaptation of a novel linked with female sexual empowerment at least dabble in empowerment?I'm clearly no expert on female sexuality, but if this film is it, the proverbial straw that stirs the drink, then I'm even more perplexed than I already was. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson, while possessing a clear understanding of how the film should look, has created a very poor final product that only toys with the idea of sexual intimacy. Taylor-Johnson isn't bold enough to show us more than brief glimpses of (to be honest) relatively tame sexual encounters between two of the ""dumbest smart"" characters in recent memory. One of the stars (Johnson) does what she can to bring the frumpy, precocious Anastasia Steele to life, in spite of how the character is written, and the other- Christian Grey- has the charisma and charm of a sloth (Dornan). Wait, I've seen some mighty enigmatic sloths. Correction- he has the charisma of a celery stalk. What does it say for their casting choice when I found myself pining for another wealthy yuppie with perverse tastes (American Psycho's Patrick Bateman)? I blame myself for getting caught up in the hype machine, but alas, Fifty Shades is simply a confusing, dreadful film.Christian Grey is a self-made billionaire, dabbling in something vaguely resembling publishing or business. By chance, Anastasia Steele (these aren't REALLY their names, are they?) gets to interview him, and she's so very intimidated that within five minutes, she's asking pointed questions. Christian begins to contact her/stalk her until she relents/agrees, and their odd dalliance begins. Why would I say odd? It is clear that she is attracted to him, but he intimidates her. She seems to enjoy what he's doing, then she's turned off by it. She seems to understand the figurative pool she's wading in, then seems shocked when it's water. It's clear that he wants her, but despite his multitude of sexual conquests, and a 'strict adherence' to the rules, he breaks them. Dornan's dull performance would have been far more palatable if his character stuck to what he said or stayed consistent throughout the film. Are his various 'shades' a purposeful choice? Perhaps, but more than anything, I just want these characters to pick a lane.Most importantly, I wonder how can this be the 'it' thing for the sexual zeitgeist and not be very sexy- in fact, paling in comparison to the occasional late night Showtime and Cinemax serial. E.L. James may have written the erotic coming-of-age tale of our time, but if this is a literal translation, I'm immensely disappointed. How can this not bother to be all that daring? What boundaries are actually stretched in Anastasia and Christian's romps? I felt going in that I might be torn from my comfort zone, which I welcomed. I wanted to be a part of a reasonable, progressive discussion about stretching the acceptable limits of sexuality, needs, wants, and desires. Instead, I've never felt such a letdown from such a supposed controversy. This film isn't interested in that discussion, at least not without inventing something that truly isn't there on-screen.What an enormous missed opportunity this film is. As Fifty Shades of Grey the novel captured the attention of so many, the film could have been something, perhaps the defining film about sexuality in our time. Instead of the immature giggling surrounding this film and novel, we could have moved forward, truly examining ourselves and asking the real questions about what we're attracted to, and what we desire. Maybe the novel has something further to say about the draw for either character to need BDSM in their lives, something that enriches the reasons for it being a huge part of the story. Maybe Anastasia has an inner dialogue in the book that fills in the gaps that the film offers. The fact that the film was released on Valentine's Day weekend is a perfect parallel to the consumer-driven farce that is the holiday.Call it false advertising, call it hype, call it my heightened expectations, but I desperately wanted to see the film that social media told me I would see. The film fails in its' inability to present the audience with an honest discussion piece about the merits of its' subject or introduce any new material regarding the current state of sexual politics. It doesn't want to be NC-17, so it cheats by holding back and not presenting the sex in a more visceral, honest way. If, in fact, this is the tale that jolted the loins of millions- this vapid, tame, cowardly tale, then I can only blame the bedroom partners of those millions for not being their own inspiration. Lovers of the world- be attentive to your partner. Learn what pleases them. Open your minds. Whatever it takes, I beg you to please your partners so the populace won't feel the need to celebrate this wooden coward of a film.",1

And what about the script, they could not afford a writer, it seems like the actors are improvising in a pathetic manner.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Worst movie I ever saw,From the beginning this movie was a disappointment.The script was not very credible the actors not very attractive.There is no chemistry and the woman does not act very crediblyThe female has a body it's about as sexy as a 12-year-olds.If you want to see some pornography or naked women don't bother with this film just go watch an actual porn movie. If you want to see a riveting love story of how a man who doesn't know how to love learns how to love I can tell you right now this movie isn't it.I've only watch the first 30 minutes of this movie mind you but this is my prediction the movies going to suck worse as I go alongWhat makes it worse is this is how I picture young Donald Trump mentally ill.,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Bad...,"First off, I read the books. And enjoyed them. This will probably be why I hated the movie so much. My first criticism would be that Grey is casted very poorly. The guy just doesn't suit the role. But my main disappointment was the screenplay. I really feel that a great romance movie could be made out of the trilogy. Unfortunately, someone smart thought that he could make a story better by rewriting all dialogues and even most scenes. The result is horrifying - you get the same events but with characters that feel completely different from the book, unbelievable, ridiculous even. A lot of people criticize the acting, and I'm not that good to judge, really, but I will make a point that this screenplay could not be acted good. No amount of acting would have made it believable. And why? Because someone read the book, COMPLETELY misunderstood the characters, and then had a VISION about how this story should be filmed as a story about a rich-ass moron pervert with no respect for women, and a horny college student with no self-awareness or self-esteem. And then they have sex, and that is the main and only drive of their relationship. Funny thing is - this movie would be much better if all scenes were simply filmed 100 percent by the book, with all dialogues unchanged. Even with bad acting. I get the impression that both scriptwriter and director read only the 1st part of the trilogy, hated it, deemed Grey a sicko and Ana as some stupid girl without any willpower, then sat together and thought: ""Damn, this kinds of characters are depicted so poorly in the book, and dialogues lack insane sex drive in every phrase, which should be a given in a PORN book. But we know how to fix this..."". Anyway, I'm rambling. For those who hated this movie - don't give up on the book. The book is about romance, not about perverts, contracts, sex and sadism, as the movie can make you think.a",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Twilight with sex, stupid, ridiculous, the worst film of 2015...","It is not news that a book so viral, with so many sales, at the end of the day make a film about this. I want to say that I did not read the book, but in terms of adaptation and censorship, i guess they had to cut too many sex scenes (some extremely stupid) so that this film would at least a rated ""R"" (or C in Mexico) but in the end, remember that I sat at the computer and I said to myself: ""will see this film without the need to look for cons or intending to criticize"" but this not hard or 10 minutes the film is a total mistake, first of all, doesn't fit me in the head the idea that this movie is romance and love (which isn't it) because I only see a gloomy, dark, stupid, full of sadomasochism or masochism atmosphere.When women come to a sick man mental attraction? do not understand it, would be because it is a millionaire? By having luxury cars? I have no idea. Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of Anastasia, a shy Virgin student who will interview Christian flock for a work of her roommate, the interaction of Jamie Dornan with Dakota Johnson is flat, do not feel real, Anastasia always has the same face: ""orgasm"" ""sadness"" ""orgasm"" ""anger"" ""orgasm"".The relationship of these two is silly, boring and uninteresting, both characters do not provide anything about charisma, become tedious and annoying, for example:Christian Grey: ""give away you a car, a computer, books and everything what your want to do you will be my submissive?""Anastasia: No, don't want to see you again (spend 2 minutes)Anastasia: I love you.For the love of God, this movie is trash! With regards to sex scenes, they promise more than they are, so do not go with the idea that sex scenes really extremely explicit and controversial.Sam Taylor-Johnson does what it can in this film, it is not her fault that the film would not work, in fact looks to put all its effort to be at least passable, fault history has it (and of course the writer James S.L) a story boring, nothing interesting, mediocre and with little originality (would forget to mention that this is ""Twilight"" with sex?)All forgivable here is the Soundtrack (by Danny Elfman) does will not be a masterpiece, but it is the only decent thing has this film (this is you can call movie? this term does not fit here...)",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Simply ruined by the ending...!!,"I saw the rating of the movie is very bad, but still everyone talking about this movie like a good one. That was the first reason why I decided to watch the movie. And the second was pretty 'Dakota Johnson'.By the way the movie was really intense to me for the eagerness of what will be next, like will he make her as his girlfriend and become a nice person like she ever wanted? going to be a forever happy one? etc. I almost felt like she conquered 80% of him and kept it going to 100%. But tragically the last 15 mins changed everything and spoiled the soothing pace of the movie. She gave up on him, and gone from his apartment because of things that never meant to be happened.Even though something horribly happened, I had a faith like any other viewer that he sooner or later showed up in front of her and beg for her love and apologize for his peculiar conduct. But the odds are favored at the end, like nothing happened and they were separated for a life time I guess! The author may be an intelligent person but I wonder, what kind of intellect was that at the end that he made. Couldn't the authors be a normal person and think like a normal person?",1

Jamie Dornan was not a convincing Christian Grey at all!! Neither was Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Such a waste of 125 min.,"This is officially the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! The acting was second rate, the characters were less then appealing. I had been told by a friend that the main character was a Sadistic F*@k... honestly, I was then intrigued, as well as excited to see what this man was capable of... I waited the entire movie to witness the sadism. To my dismay, nothing.. Nothing in this movie was in any nature sadistic. In my opinion this movie was worse then the Late Night ""B"" rated movies on Cinemax, or Worse yet the old Late night ""USA UP ALL NIGHT"" so called Sexualy Explicit movies. Just because this movie shows some breasts, the implication of fully naked bodies, and a peek of hairy male genitalia, which by the way I find repulsive, by no means makes it worthy of any exciting review or trailer.. Teenage movies on LMN have better plots and better implications of sexual tension. By far this was the biggest waste of my time, 125 min of my life I will never get back.

Fifty Shades of Grey,A horrendous disturbing film,"I have always been curious about this film and I decided to watch it and what a mistake that was. The premise of this film sees an average girl become infatuated with a billionaire playboy with a weird hobby. Now dakota johnson plays Anastasia steele and she is the only real positive in this film because she is okay in this film. She delivers a somewhat decent performance but her character is so boring in this film and has absolutely nothing special about her. Jamie dornan plays Christian grey and this is one of the most boring dislikeable people I have seen in film. These two's chemistry is just never there and it really makes this film painful to watch. The rest of the characters are obsolete and completely pointless to the whole story. The story is just bad, this is a love story but the problem is that there is no romance and no chemistry between the two characters. Also the film ends abruptly with no payoff so you really wonder why you even bothered. The script is awful with the dialogue being cringeworthy and really hard to believe. The style of the film is pretty racy, there is allot of sex in this film but you can find that on the internet for free. Overall this is a film you really don't need to see and you should definitely avoid at all costs.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Grey Review,"Fifty Shades of Grey(2015) Starring: Dakota Johnson, Jamie Dorman, Jennifer Ehle, Eloise Mumford, Victor Rasuk, Luke Grimes, Marcia Gay Harden, Rita Ora, Max Martini, Callum Keith Rennie, Andrew Airlie, Dylan Neal, Rachel Skarsten, and Emily Fonda Directed By: Sam Taylor-Johnson Review MR. GREY WILL SEE YOU NOW Hello Kiddies your pal the Cupid Critic here and you know what I hate? Try mixing Twilight with porn, it equals crap, now make that crap into a movie and you get something much worse, this movie. This film is based off the popular novel by E.L James which was started as a twilight fan-fiction, turned into a novel, became a best seller somehow and now its one of the worst movies of this year. But guess what, it's made money so were going to have to sit through the next two sequels that will probably be made. The film is about Anastasia Steele, who does an interview for her friend Kate who is sick but after Ana comes back from the interview she feels better miraculously for some reason. Ana has to interview Christian Grey who is a young and very successful billionaire. She has the hots for him for some reason and is being asked to sign up to be his submissive to explore her sexual side. The film has the goal of appealing to it's demographic, I am not among that demographic but as film that is meant to have meaning, or be enjoyable, or fun even it most certainly does not succeed. All the characters feel like one dimensional real-world twilight characters. You got the female lead who is in love with the tough guy who is dangerous for her, you've got the completely different friend/roommate, and good friend who is in love her which sets up the love triangle. You probably want to know what I thought about the BDSM sex scenes, their there and I was not aroused. They are just filler and a plot device to tell this story, your girl might take you to see this but will make you delete your porn history. The acting in the film is alright from Dakota Johnson, I feel she could be doing better if the dialogue wan't so horrible. The direction is actually kind of good too. But as a whole this movie is fifty shades of crap, I'm giving it one silver ball out of five.( if you've read the book you'll get the silver ball reference.)",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Where is the 0/10 option?,"For me this was bad, uninteresting and not worth of my consideration in any serious way. So I don't know if it is the subject matter, the idea of it, or the acting. It has been said that art imitates life. If for a minute I can remotely consider this to be art, then if this movie is supposed to represent some aspect of contemporary life, then I ask myself how things got here? I think this movie was wildly popular, particularly with women. Symbolically then, this disappoints me as I could find nothing endearing about it at all. How is it that this is popular? Am I out of step or does this fantasy appeal to so many in life? Is there anything of a higher order that people can turn to instead? I can't remember if I even bothered to watch it all the way to the end. I think in my mind I am trying to wipe out any interest I have or may have had with this. My understanding is that this movie has been turned into a Franchise. At a time in history when the world is at its most abundant stage, this movie and its offspring represents a different form of poverty.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,The worst ever!,"Spoiler? well....This book/story deserves a better movie. Poorly done, felt like it was done by a student. Barely any conversations and all major details were gone! Dakota is probably the worst actress for now. She looked more like a recovering alcoholic who lost her hairbrush somewhere deep in woods, while Dornan was more of Edward Cullen's twin, only with bigger eyes. The part where she is like .."" I mean, look at me..."" and he goes ""I'm looking"" (I'm looking at your limp hair, bad acting skills and don't understand how you got picked for this movie!)...No mention of ""inner goddess"" (if you read the book, you know what I'm talking about). I mean, you gotta be drunk to kind of like this piece of ""art"". I feel bad for the author, that's a major failure, major!!! Some people in our audience fell asleep and started snoring, I bet! All religious organizations who are boycotting this movie don't even need to because it already failed. Seriously, I never felt so bad for spending $11. Perhaps, the only thing that was good is music...Thanks to Beyonce, Sia, Ellie Goulding and the rest (sorry, if I misspelled their names). Maybe Beyonce got the biggest part of movie budget and that's what made it so poor.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A piece of worthless crap,"If I could leave a 0/10, I would have done it ages ago. That is how awful this ""film"" is. I'm not sure if this deserves to be called a ""film"". It's more like garbage pieces that are being crumpled dreadfully together by three mad, blind cats. Not to mention the ""actors and actresses"". If they could be actors and actresses, so could the three mad, blind cats I mentioned earlier. Their speeches are so not natural. And the plot of this film, if it even has a plot, is just down-right terrible. No idea how the director could make such revolting a film from such nauseating a book. I bet on my life that a mad, blind cat could direct a better film than this!2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Tripe,"Curiosity killed the cat and I decided to watch Fifty Shades Of Grey.It was like every story ever told put into two hours and retold badly.She is Elizabeth Bennet, he is Mr Darcy. She is Bella, he is Edward. She is Cathy, he is Heathcliff, except Cathy didn't have a beak and scratty bangs, and Heathcliff wasn't a piece of laminate flooring.It's not clever enough to be about love, and it isn't exciting enough to be about pleasure, it's a bleak illustration of how futile and repulsive our need to put a long stick into a round space really is.I've had more erotic shits than any of it, but I still watched all of it, and E L James is still a millionaire. The damage has been done.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,As expected this movie was way horrible.Both Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson's acting looked awkward and there was literally zero chemistry between them.,As expected this movie was way horrible.Though the book was also not that great and the writing was childish at least it had described the chemistry between Ana and Christian but the said chemistry was obviously missing between the two actors in the movie.Both Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson's acting looked awkward and there was literally zero chemistry between them. Dakota Johnson was comparatively a better actor among the two and though I haven't watched any movies of Jamie Dorman and can't say how his acting is but in this movie it was horrible.He was clearly not suited for the role and was forcefully trying to get that domineering look of Christian Grey. Apart from that the plot was stupid because I certainly don't think that a guy who wants to hurt you physically is hot or romantic.Definitely a complete waste of two hours.2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Horribly miscast,"Reading all three books, which weren't horrible and actually did have a story to tell, this movie was a complete disappointment. For those who read the books in their entirety (and didn't just flip through to the sexual content), the book does have an interesting character driven story. However, from Christian Grey's appearance to Ana's inability to not look like a moron trying to pull off a sexy lip-biting look, the movie is completely miscast. I doubt that the actors or anyone involved in the making of this movie actually took the time to read the original book. The acting is horrible; the actors seem to be simply acting out the color gray. Complete garbage; didn't even make it through the whole movie. If you must see it for yourself, wait until it's on your local cable channel's free list.2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Complete waste of time,"The advertisements for this movie left little to hope for. So I didn't go into it with high hopes and even then it managed to disappoint. The acting was forced and pathetic. It was set out like a teenage love film with occasional scenes of horrifically strange sex acts. It would also have been great if Ana followed the common procedure of shaving her private area... or at least trimming it dear Heavens. I literally fell asleep during this movie and got woken up by another viewer falling asleep and dropping their popcorn. The movie ends with the suggestion of the other two books being made into movies but Jamie Dornan is refusing to be Mr Grey anymore so it will hardly make sense. However, thanks to this wonderful decision of his a third series of The Fall has been announced.2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Horrible,"OH MY GOD! This movie was just horrible! Just horrible! Thank God I did not spend more than 10 dollars watching this in the Theatre. I rented it with my husband this past weekend and he stopped watching about 45 min into it. I tortured myself and stuck it out to the very end. What a disaster of a movie. I have seen real porn with better acting and that's not saying much. Dakota's acting was awful, she did not convince me at all. Jamie's acting was also just as dreadful. In my opinion he should have been darker, he did not get into his character whatsoever. The chemistry between them was non existent, I have more chemistry with a piece of rock!

These are intense, erotic movies with good story lines, superb acting, compatible actors; and they make you feel anxious.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Successful white guy uses a minion for his amusement...,"Seriously tedious movie; the actors almost seem embarrassed to be delivering the contrived lines some drone slung together for them. I've never read the book and now have no wish to do so. There was no chemistry between the lead actors and the soft-porn-esque ""sex"" scenes were truly cringe-worthy.The worst part of it is the underlying notion of powerful, successful white guy who gets to own (or buy; depending how you look at it) another person for his own amusement.My partner and I both find the notion offensive; we turned the DVD off after about 30 minutes.I am so glad we didn't see this at the cinema; would have been a waste of good money!I tried to change my vote to ""0"".",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Stay away from this movie like the plague!!,"Despite all the hype and promotional efforts. This movie is a piece of rubbish and a disgrace to film-making.I must admit, I'm not a fan of film noire or abstract themes but I can still appreciate good acting, film-making and storytelling. This movie had none of the above. It is simply a bad piece of film. Total rubbish that needs to be swept out to the streets and picked up by a dump truck and taken to the tip. It is that bad.The story itself is absolutely terrible. The acting had no chemistry and is based on a theme that is simply stuck together with sticky tape and hopefully it will work.I hated Bird-Man but I appreciate the acting and editing etc, this movie is bad on all angles and from every possible aspect. The film makers should be ashamed. Don't waste your money and time. Seriously, even if you're a true film lover and abstract-art house person, you simply will not cannot appreciate this piece of rubbish.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I've seen nothing as poor as this, and I probably never will","This film is beyond me, it's beyond terrible so much so that it gives cinema a bad reputation. Me and a friend saw this in a half full screening of mainly women, us being the minority male viewers.Firstly, how women can like this is shocking. There's blatantly no chemistry or expression of any intimacy between the two lead characters. There's nothing to suggest why any women would be even slightly aroused by the behaviour of this poorly written ""dominant"". It's almost as if you just presume they didn't actually like each other in any way, outside of the role.That being said,and it being so obvious, this film is degrading to women everywhere. The book must be too. If I presented a contract that suggested I sexually abused you via things like whips, sex toys and fisting you, I would expect you to run a mile or 60. The fact that he can do this (in film and book) and people found it arousing is pathetic. E.L James has degraded women everywhere, she's literally wrote something that dumps every morale standing women have, everything about Mr.Grey's behaviour is stereotypically slating the standards of females. By her writing, it's fine to treat women poorly if you have a ton of money, you've got a great body and like to exert the power you have to belittle women. Also, you like to intimidate them to a point where they can't speak, invade their lives like a stalker and force yourself into everything they do as if you were a spot on their face, just when they wanted to look flawless.I've never noticed poor choreography in a film, this film opened my eyes to how not to get actors/actresses to move on screen. It's awkward. The characters emotions are completely backward, there are points where the audience thinks she should do one thing, she does the opposite. Then its vice versa next scene.Don't waste you're time watching this generic, forcefully made, un-erotic, poorly written, terribly directed, miss- cast leads and emotionally redundant garbage.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,This one should listed in porn site,"Well done. Finally porn world has a new video. But i am appreciate Dakota's acting. It wasn't bad. But Mr Grey...? Ewhhh... Are you serious? Where were your eyes guys? Why did you pick him as Grey? He doesn't looks horny when there are sex scene. He doesn't look like bdsm lover. He looks weird especially in bathroom scene. Well actually Dakota looks weird. And guys, why don't you put his vital in the movie? I mean come on. Dakota showed her breast. And your purpose is to make the watchers horny right? And I'm sure if your purpose is to make a good movie with art, it wont be like this. This is a seriously trash. I mean it about this movie is a porn. Even my boyfriend watched this just the sex scenes. He said he don't wanna watch another scene because it was boring.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty shades of awful.,"I honestly don't even know where to begin. I'd rather watch fifty shades of gray paint dry. It would definitely be more entertaining. Now before all you crazies out there start attacking, yes I did indeed read the books. All of them. This movie is just terrible. So terrible. I don't know who they paid to cast this movie but from the looks of it they were most likely blind and deaf, or at least I hope they were because there is no other explanation for this trash. Tell me why Christian looks like his balls dropped yesterday, with his 12 year old self. And Anastasia? Really now!? Anastasia was looking a little rough and old, and that's before all the beatings happened. I honestly feel like the theater needs to refund my money and than on top of that pay me yet another $20 dollars for the 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. Between Christians constipated look and Ana's old lady self, I couldn't contain my giggles.

I'm a Seattle-ite so, for those who were impressed with the scenery, all I can say is; ""What scenery?""For those who haven't seen this, be glad. You can do so much with 2 hours of your time which I will not get back on mine. The book wasn't literary genius and it is obvious the film will not be classic. The only saving grace of the film is none, zilch, zero. There was not a single redeemable frame in the film!

Fifty Shades of Grey,How to make an unerotic erotic movie,"I watched this because I was advised to by... feminist women, who found it great.OK, first the sex scenes. They are rare and short, but more particularly they give the impression of having been edited by a puritan committee, which is totally awkward, because contradicting the intention to show kink. They stink, not of BDSM violence, but of such a hypocritical mixture of peeping and decency.Then, the emotional build-up maybe? Because that would differentiate a mainstream movie from cheap porn, right? Well, the male lead shows the emotions of a real estate agent walking a client through posh apartments, while all the time doubting that the client can pay. And as far as the fascinating virility goes, it turns out he has Mummy issues. The female lead displays the emotions of a girl visiting a new sports club. And eventually she decides she's not interested anyway. Good thing the director made her bite her lips a few times, so we can notice she felt some kind of fear. But her eyes looked totally uninterested throughout. The guy too.In the meanwhile, you have to sit through a lot of seemingly irrelevant scenes. In that respect they have achieved the feat of making those scenes feel both extremely long and extremely rushed. You constantly wonder if you might have missed something, that would explain where is the dramatic tension. Or even why the characters are there.So, basically, a very unpleasant movie. The real phenomenon is why it attracted such crowds. Surely the trailer made it appear hot, that accounts for the male audience presumably, so congrats to the producers for the tease of the decade. But what about those who declared it fascinating even after having watched it? Apparently, exclusively women.Here people like me are left in the role of a chemist during an experiment, seeing that something happens, and concluding that there must be a chemical element that has not been detected yet. The only element that I can assume is that the guy is immensely rich.To conclude, I would say that this is a success, not at all a failure. It achieved exactly what it was meant to achieve: lots of bucks.It will give lots of women an opportunity to complain about domestic abuse. Then lots of men will reply that a relationship where the woman says yes all the time, then finally says no and walks out free, is not domestic abuse. And altogether it will make a lot of tickets sold.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Boring and gross,"Terrible acting, The actor who plays Christian Grey isn't this ""ideal, gorgeous man"" as he is portrayed to be in the book. Too much FEMALE nudity... why do a bunch of women want to have to look at her breasts and naked butt the whole time? Literally the whole movie is just about a naked girl. No plot. Poor acting. Cheesy scripts. And very bad ending. The worst ending I have ever seen on any movie. And worst of all, guys miss the point. They think women love rough sex... but you pretty much have to be a gorgeous, loyal billionaire to treat a women so badly. Jamie Doran was only average looking.. I actually don't find him remotely attractive at all. And I don't think he played the part of a successful BILLIONAIRE very well. Why would a billionaire who runs a successful company be wasting his time taking care of a drunken college student who is throwing up?

In terms of conversations, it had as many lines as a Van Damme movie. She seems scared and about to cry most of the time, while he looks stupid and says things that make you think he's reciting from a different script. The sex scenes are really weak, there is no tension between the 2; the story and the characters don't seem to evolve naturally, rather the whole action seems fake and awkward.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Horrid, vapid, sad bleed-out of a tale","Actually, I will start off my review by quoting Anthony Lane's review of this film:""Mostly, he sounds like your basic stalker: ""I'm incapable of leaving you alone,"" he informs Ana‚Äîa notion that appears to stimulate her, although it would easily warrant a call to 911. She succumbs, up to a point, but her recurring doubts lead Christian to dish up one of those crusty old no-means-yes propositions which feminism has battled for decades: ""You want to leave? Your body tells me something different."" Pass the butt plug.""Indeed. This film is tragic, in a variety of ways, and sexy in none (for me, at least). And probably for a bunch of other people as well, as this film has marked 4.2/10 on IMDb, which is remarkably low. Still, I give this film 1/10 for a variety of reasons.The characters are one-dimensional. The main character is ""god"" and, because of the book, is never-smiling and drab. I mean, if he'd only have been interesting in some way! He comes across all Bruce Wayne- y, body sculpted, can do everything (fly a helicopter, play the piano, own at least 75 different neckties), but lacks everything that he should have. Compare this with the lead character in Steve McQueen's ""Shame"": he says very little, but exudes so much, much more than this film collectively ever will.The female lead character is just an object, nothing more. A boring, self-deprecating object with a touch of defiance, only there to display her as an individual, somebody who doesn't let anything happen to her as she's master of her own will.Still, pap like ""I'm incapable of leaving you alone"" creeps me the hell out, it is _not_ sexy or passionate. It's cheap. And cheapens a lot of things. A lot of people who actually do enjoy BDSM have raised their voices against this film as it's apparently against what is considered safe BDSM use, and goes against more than that.The soundtrack is a safe word in this film; down-watered covers, mainly used to be ""sultry"" and ""sensual"", no doubt, but are, in fact, like adding poop to your champagne. Not that this film is champagne in any way, shape or form; champagne is palatable. This film is not.Avoid. There will be sequels. I'll avoid those.",1

Really, the book was bad enough but to make this into a movie, to show this to people and call it sexy when really it's offensive, stereotypical, damaging, sexist, and encouraging for rape culture? This is not BDSM. This is not safe, consenting or good s3x. This is Hollywood, once again, getting something wrong and thinking it's okay because shock value will make them money.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Get some therapy.,"Dear female (non-feminist) reviewersSimply putting adjectives like 'amazing' in capital letters and adding some exclamation marks does not a review make. Nor is it a sign of sexual inhibition to hate the franchise and everything it stands for - rather the opposite is true, I'd say. Finally, the fact that the adaption is like the book, is not, in itself, any kind of recommendation. Instead, you may ask yourself why you'd be interested in a film about an unpleasant bully who forces a patently slow-witted woman into increasingly brutal sexual practices because he likes abusing women. In fact, it couldn't be any clearer, he actually says he can only get off with women when he's inflicting pain on them!

Fifty Shades of Grey,The Downfall of Film,"I'd just like to start by saying that this ""film"" stands as an insult to the very foundations of the film industry. It's success hinges on women and adolescent school girls who find the idea of BDSM as romantic or enticing but yet make the firm labels of ""violence against women is wrong"" and ""men are the enemy, look what they do to women"". Look I'll pull away from that because that's not the point. The story is the tag line of a soft core porno which somehow made it on to the big screen, that's society for you. The acting is laughable, I mean I've seen children show more talent when refusing to eat broccoli. The artistic value is non existent. The screenplay and cinematography is well below par and to cap off the fact that this film made as much money as it did is once again a disgraceful reflection on society today. I can't walk through a shopping mall without it being shoved in my face every 10 seconds. So now I pose the question, why was this made into a film? Why was this given priority screening, unreasonable budget and promotion when there is about a billion other idealistic teens, adults and film makers who could think up a more satisfactory, resonating story in the snap of a finger. I'm really appalled at the commercial success of this ""film"" and really hope that this doesn't start the trend of poor films. Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg and about a thousand other film makers didn't give their lives to the film industry for it to become this cesspool of filth.",1

However, it is well photographed - in other words it doesn't look like the cheap porn movies they were making in ""Boogie Nights"", which was a first class film about the porn industry.This is just a soft core porn biology lesson, plain and simple. Another movie in a similar vein was ""The Lover"", which was was much better done than this. Sure, ""The Lover"" had hot sex scenes, but it had character development and atmosphere too. This film would make sex seem boring to teenage boys. I didn't read the book, so I can't speak to how true it is to it, but if it did follow it closely, I can't imagine how the book could have been a success.Avoid and don't waste your time.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Toxic and dangerous,"I'm not gonna say anything about misrepresentation of BDSM because there is enough information on that. What I want to say is how this movie literally gave me flashbacks from my previous abusive relationship because of how much similar Christian's behavior was to my abuser. Lovebombing, stalking, controlling behavior, isolation... How do people not see that? It's not romantic when your partner tracks your location and appears wherever you are, it's creepy and a red flag. It's not hot when your partner tells you what to eat and what birth control to take, it's damaging and humiliating. It's not generous when you get gifts and attention only when your partner feels like you are angry with them, it messes with your head and clouds your judgement. Nothing about it is hot, especially the part of bringing an inexperienced person into your kinks and shaming them for not going along with it or refusing to have an adult conversation with them to explain your side and be understanding about their limits.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,569 Million Worldwide? WHAT THE F#@#???,"The most retarded movie ever? Yea, and the most boring and atrocious also, with the worst ""acting"" I've seen this year(or ever). I mean even the writing for the Twilight movies in comparison to this seems like a Nobel winning prize of literature. To think that this movie made 569 million dollars worldwide making 529 million of profit, is just mind boggling. Are so many women really that emotionally bankrupt and bored that they are entertained by this? This obviously means there will be a sequel in 2017!!!WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE???P.S. Someone needs to start a petition to ban 2017 from happening, we need to just instantly skip to 2018.#Rant2 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Dumb,"Actually, dumb and disappointing. The acting was poor, the direction (was there really a director?) was non-existent, the plot was so bad that describing it as ""no plot"" would be most accurate. Those moviegoers who were expecting some erotic excitement were cheated. The beginning and end of the story could only be best described as when the film started and when it ended. In short, there was no reason to go to see this movie at all. I saw it on one of my pay movie channels so thankfully, I was out no money, and the producers and director received not a cent from me. What I was out was two hours of my life that I can't get back. And, oh yes, there was some emotion, but it was all mine and is better defined as anger. I have only gone to two movies in my life that were so bad that I growled around the theater searching for the manager so I could sign for and get my money back. This one was so bad that physical damage to the theater or the manager would only do even if I got my money back. Please, please don't watch this movie, even if you watch it for free, because it's not even worth zero. I thought (very briefly) of giving the movie a rating of ""2,"" because seeing the female star naked might be worth a ""2"" and she is indeed pretty and sexy. But I came to my senses and you should as well.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Fifty shades of ""don't waste ur time""","So whenever I watch a movie with my husband either he or I will go to IMDb to read the reviews, and we both usually believe the ones with the most criticism in them. Neither one of us wrote a review EVER. Not until now, at least. If you are reading this, please take my advice and give up on the idea of watching this piece of garbage, unless you really absolutely have a miserable life and hate yourself with passion. One of my girlfriends read a book and was fascinated by it. When I asked her what was it about she told me ""it had to do with one girl's exploration of her body and sexual limits"", I instantly knew it was most likely some kind of ""soft porn"" (my husband's words) and gave up on the idea of even asking details let alone reading the book. I am English lit graduate, so I refuse to read just anything. Anyway, I happened to have a really rough past couple of weeks (tons of work and homework) and needed something to relax a bit, and I find this so excellently advertised movie and decide to watch it while dog-sitting my friend's puppy. I wish I'd never done it. I am not, unfortunately, one of those people who just turn to different channel when they don't like something, I just get it over with no matter how painful it is. This way none of my sexually neglected (by their husbands) friends will have enough arguments to convince me it's a good movie/show. So I watch it and I cuss and I swear and hate myself for ever starting to watch this. One word: CHEAP! From acting, actors, theme, conversations etc. CHEAP! Don't do it, if you do you will regret it for the rest of your life, just like I will. Go to the local library and rent Lady Chatterley's Lover instead.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Dreck,"Well I'm impressed that They made a bunch of money ripping off Secretary, 9 1/2 weeks and Thomas Crown all in one go! How did they get away with it?I can't think that any of the actors would come away unscathed and have a career after this debacle. And sadly Marcia Gay Harden signed off for just a few minutes of screen time (honestly, she should have read the script beforehand) which means she won't suffer too much permanent damage. The costumes were sad, the sets were boring, the plot line was non existent. What more can you say?

Fifty Shades of Grey,No Excuse For Abuse,"1 star for the soundtrack. Take away Christian's money and looks and you've got yourself all the symptoms of a serial rapist, psychopathic misogynist with mummy issues.Australia's best female morning news host Lisa Wilkinson said it best; ""Fifty Shades of Grey is more appalling than appealing. It's domestic violence dressed up as erotica¬Ö and if there's one thing this movie is not, it's erotic.Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey is the 30-something jerk of a billionaire who never seems to work. An emotionally crippled narcissist no one could love. Meanwhile, Dakota Johnson is the one-dimensional, lip-biting (could someone please get that girl a chapstick!) totally pathetic Anastasia Steele, who for no discernible reason falls in love with the aforementioned jerk and, single-handedly, sells women across the world short.""2 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Is this a movie or porn?,"I watched this film a year after its release. I heard all of the negative reviews, and as someone who has never read the books, I was curious about the film. I ended up being highly disappointed. 2 hours and 5 minutes of my life that I will never get back.Let me start off by saying that Jamie Dornan's American accent was less than average and threw me off throughout the film. Now on to the movie, the pacing was very slow and the ""storyline"" was quite boring. I had to fast-forward the last 30 minutes of the movie because I was waiting for something interesting to happen. Maybe a shocking ending. In reality, what I saw was about 20 minutes of ""romance"" that could pass for pornography. Sidenote: Is really a rich man who stalks a girl something that women find attractive?In my honest opinion, don't waste your time watching this movie. I bet the sequel will flop.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,A Gob full of Sh*te,"Okay to begin with, due to the hype of this movie i had high expectations but unfortunately reality smacked me like a whip in the face. It was a huge disappointment as there was no real plot, climax or sufficient ending the only thing that really kept me watching was the constant barrage of sexual scenes and nudity. I would definitely not recommend this for couples or you alone unless the only thing you're going for is the sex and not a serious plot line. In my opinion it was not worth the money and if you really want to see it just go and watch it when released online.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Don't waste your hard earned money on this movie,"The cast was terrible, as was the acting. I was a fan of the book for a short time but it's so horribly written and edited that I stopped reading half way into the second. If you've taken the time to read the books, and if you do waste two hours of your life on this movie you'll realize how bad the movie skips around making no sense at parts. My cousin will hate me forever now that I made him go see it with me. In the book it's about 2 people that are gorgeous obviously, why the hell did they cast Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan!? The other guys in the movie were all hotter than Christian! And as for the raunchy sex scenes, well sorry but not raunchy enough in my opinion. If you're going to make a dirty book into a movie go with a porn company and do it big, do it right. Give us all what we want. And use a sexier cast please. I've seen better acting in porn movies haha. It doesn't even deserve one star. Oh and for them to go into such specific detail about what Taylor looks like in the book and to make him some creepy white guy in the movie was just wrong!3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Misconceptions,"****Contains NO spoilers****That's what this crap of a movie should have been titledI saw this move (against my will and better judgment ‚Äì long story) days before its theatrical release. Now that the initial hype has greatly subsided, I felt it was time to post my thoughts about Fifty Shades of Grey.SKIP IT!!What a lot of misconceptions in which Hollywood over glorifies as well as glamorizes in what they (including the author of this poorly scripted ¬Öbadly written mess of a book series) perceive this life and concept is and consists of. How do I know this? Basically, because I'm a switch ‚Äì meaning I exhibit both dominant and submissive personalities within this lifestyle.Just skip this movie as well as the book series. If you're curious, read The Story of O or the works by Marquis DE Sade. Better yet, if you truly want to feel sexual tension in an office setting, rent The Secretary. Trust me, this classic James Spader with Maggie Gyllenhaal movie is WAY better that Fifty Shades of Whatever hands down.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Ruined the image of the books - Shambles,"I have to admit I've read all 3 books and I absolutely loved them. So when i heard the film was coming out i was so excited to see how they had portrayed the characters and the story line. However I think the only one that was even slightly similar to the book was Jamie Dorman(Christian Grey) the rest of the acting was cheesy and just awful.Disappointing doesn't even come close to how me and a few friends felt, it made us feel physically annoyed at how they completely destroyed the imagery of the book, they missed out every crucial part to the book, the ending was just god-damn awful as well it didn't even go through the entire scene between her and Christian.This is definitely a film I think that should be started from scratch and re-done and directed completely by E.L.James as she is the only one that clearly seems to have the right creativity to produce something like this.To some it up.Don't Waste Your Money!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Too bad,"I was sorely disappointed by this films overall lack of details... Not in terms of the sex, but in key elements that were relatively crucial moments in the book. Of course the actors cast for the roles ( all roles) have much to do with my disappointment in this film. Sadly, Jamie Doran, as adorable as he is, was the wrong man to portray Grey and Johnson... Somehow she reminds me of Kristin Stewart, whom I personally think is the worst actress to ever be blessed with hit roles & movies in the Twilight Saga. OK, so I went a little off track, Johnson isn't that bad, maybe even a great actress in other roles... But perhaps it was the overall disappointment in the screenplay that made me cringe during this film. I was not expecting this movie to be as 'B' rated as it was. üëéüëé3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,despicable,"I'm not sure if Sam Taylor Johnson did not understand the depth of the book E.L James so brilliantly created but I am deeply sad and confused on to why she would think that movie would suffice to the intensity that was portrayed inside the book. I can go down a list of regrets Miss Sam should have let alone the embarrassment she should feel. She in no way did this movie justice, and I CALL FOR A REMAKE. That was NOT the Fifty Shades Of Grey that any of us has read. She took this book from a grown adult read to a children's book, for Jesus Christ did it even qualify for rated R I mean come on it belongs in the PG13 movie section. Honestly, Sam must've read the Wikipedia version of this book as a lot of us used to do for our English class. Wow I am ashamed, for her..for the audience.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Nothing but a bad chick flick version of BDSM,"I didn't know about 50 Shades Of Grey until February, when it was shoved onto everybody's face. I never heard of the wildly popular book, either. Of course, that's because any book that is wildly popular is usually some scribble geared to teenagers. Not to say that I haven't indulged in schlock as my brothers and I read Sidney Sheldon books in the 1990's. These days, I am a lot more careful about my reading material.So going into this movie, I knew nothing about the contents of the book or what it was all about. After viewing it, I can't understand why anybody would want to see this crud in a theater. 50 Shades Of Grey represents the nadir of Hollywood. Proof positive that crap can draw money because people will pay to watch mediocrity (which this film isn't even) and praise it because they refuse to bother looking for the much better in years past. Films from 1975 explored BDSM way more explicitly and honestly than this fluff.All this film offers are Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) doing G-rated versions of BDSM. That's it. Add in horrible acting from the entire cast, a insipid script written by Kelly Marcel in which she channels a 7th grader's mindset and terrible direction from Sam Taylor-Johnson and you have a multi Razzie Award winner come to life. Boring, unerotic and sterile is all I can say. There's much better out there in regards to films exploring BDSM. If they make a sequel, boycott it. Tell Hollywood that you're not going to get your intelligence insulted any longer.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,One of the worst movies ever!,"I went to watch this movie due to the strong propaganda on the media. Everybody talking about the movie, my curiosity was in its peak I heard that the movie was not very good, although what I found is a terrible, horrible and outrageous movie As a woman, the only thing I can say is: disgusting!!! There were scenes I was not able to see. It damaged my own honor as a woman... i was about to leave the cinema in the half of the movie... I felt terrible indignant with such a horrible movie My main concern is how harmful this movie can be teenagers (specially girls), who consider that kind of unrealistic movies as a reference.The way Grey treats Anastasia is cold and horrible. No woman on earth can feel really attracted by such a bastard.This kind of movie is just harmful for society.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Nothing,I'm so disappointed because I expect too much. I don't know but I fell asleep while watching. I don't feel anything while watching. I was just totally bored. There's no chemistry between the characters. Christian Grey is not intense as I expected and completely zero emotions. His voice is just not what I'm expecting. It feels like he's just reading the script. Anastasia Steele sounds flirt? I mean she should be shy and not too giddy right? Kate is not what I picture her to be. The sex was okay. I feel like this is the end of both lead actors career. It's just bad for me. I hope the sequel will redeem this one cause I really like the book.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,could of done a better film,"50 shades isn't as good as what people was hoping. It hasn't got anything in the film that was in the book, such as the foil from condoms he unwrapped, it doesn't show her giving the glider to Christian from what she got from seeing her mum also the kissing in the lift didn't happen till later on in the book you never saw him ask her out for coffee she just tells Kate that he asked her. Also after her first time Kate asks her how it went and if he made her cum the first time and go in to detail about it. She just says you look different and Anna goes I feel it doesn't explain how she does. , I know its not got half the hard core sex bits in but that's what most women falled in love with the book. The film has ruined it. The film was the new talk with most women, it should have had more effort to keep in line with the book with every little detail as well as the dirty parts. Could of done a lot better should of been a bit longer with more detail and kept with the story line of the book not made up bits in a hour and 56 minutes3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Terrible Shades of Grey,"I didn't read the book, yet I'm intrigued, so I gave it a go for the movie cause with all the talk you surely got this tad bit of curiosity on you. To be honest the 2 minutes trailer I watched basically sum the whole movie plus contains the whole best part of it, so yeah basically out of 125 minutes, I mostly enjoyed the 2 minutes trailer more.The act are terrible, the story line are way more, it's just cheap porn all in all and nothing more. If anyone say that Jamie Dornan are sexy in that movie, I beg your pardon but he's not and during the whole movie he just scream awkward. That Anna girl seems to try so hard that she looks so fake.I definitely waste my time and my money on this, and I hope no other will be so dumb as me, to fall for the great two minutes trailer and feels so bad afterward to watch such terrible movie.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Terrible plot, conversation, depiction of BDSM","This is simply a horrible movie (I'm reviewing the movie, not the book). Ana through doesn't display an innocent, studious college girl. She displays a mentally handicapped person who can't even interview or dress well for an interview or talk properly!!! She doesn't show any love for Christian except being captivated by his looks and wanting to touch him--the line comes up almost every few minutes half-way through. Neither boy nor spastic/handicapped girl display any common ground at all. Instead, there is a handicapped girl who never owns a laptop or computer (unbelievable for a student) who wants to ""love"" a guy for no reason other than looks. She's never heard of BDSM (he erroneously introduces the sport as dominant and submissive as if that's it) and then suddenly accepts it via an idiotic and poorly worded NDa and contract. Christian acts more like a stalker and serial killer than a person or even a guy wanting to like not even love her. The whole sex/tie up/spanking/blindfolding (that is not even a tie-up game) session is more like a spider tying up a dumb fly than bondage at all. The final part of ""punishment"" is more like ISIL/ISIS style torture than sexual punishment.Watch the show to see a mentally handicapped girl and a dumb guy. But as always there are people who want to love idiotic shows and TV series.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,very bad movie,"Edward Christian have been .Bell Anastasia. Bella and Anastasia have the same character. Even copied biting Bella all lips. Edward fleeing people. because Edward is a vampire. Christian is sadomasochist.completely ridiculous movie with nothing to do with romance. (i am not incapable of leaving you alone And do not) had the same dialog in the twilight.Twilight fans should remain silent. Twilight has developed a lot of people's lives in a positive way. Bella is the basis of the behavior of individual problems can be interpreted correctly. but Anastasia is not a role model for people. Anastasia accept kinky desires of the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. this is not normal. not things that make a girl looking for the love of life for many years. There are many quotations from the Twilight movie series before.After the Twilight series, was associated with many films about vampire. Fifty Shades of Grey, but the worst movie ever made.completely sexual nature film. You will not find anything related to romance.can only understand the twilight fans. !!!can only understand the twilight fans.!!! if twilight brought about a change in your life, this movie will do the opposite effect.because twilight showed true love people.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,So so so disappointed,"Couldn't wait for this movie to come out after reading the books but was so disappointed by this movie. HORRIBLE cinematography, scenes didn't transition smoothly and it left you feeling very awkward. The two unfortunately did not pull off the desire the books makes you feel during the sex scenes. In the book Christian Grey is seen as a serious, no messing around guy but the entire time he talks in the movie, Dornan is smirking oddly and doesn't give the same ominous sex appeal that is so vividly described in the books. Also, the entire time in the movie all I could hear was Dornan's thick accent. All around bummed out that this movie did such a poor job at meeting the expectations of movie viewers and fans of the books.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Don't let curiosity rob you off precious time u will lose on this movie,"I can honestly say that whatever marketing company marketed this book must be amazing, any company that can get masses and masses to spend money on such despicably written insult to literature must be amazing. The only feat is on the marketing company for the movie as well. Such trash. Makes me ashamed that I am a woman and the success of this franchise makes me realize that indeed women are stupid and men treat us like idiots because general population of women who contribute to the popularity of this series shows just that. Also it is clearly an indication of how much of women are sexually repressed and unhappy with their sex lives that even such badly written stuff helps them imagine a better sex life. I am so glad that no respectable actors have accepted to be part of this movie, I would have hated to see any decent actors reputation be tarnished with this movie. The actors are awful, Mr Grey looks like the dude from Cruel intentions with curly blonde hair had a love child with Barney from how i met your mother and he is the resultant weird looking kid. Anastasia (i even hate her name) needs to get her nose done! I never encourage plastic surgery but my god the girl could use it, get some lip fillers, decent teeth. Actually she should stop appearing on screen bcos she is so displeasing to see. Everyone in this movie is awful at acting. In defense of the actors it would have been near impossible to produce decent acting with those awful lines and scenes anyway and all the actors are straight from starbucks i presume so considering that...they are barely alright... Also no human ever lives this storyline ever, none of those sentences were ever said by anyone ever. Also casting what looks like a 35 year old for the role of a virgin? deserves a belly laugh really, she has crows feet and lines all over her face and the fact that her teeth are mostly worn away from the fact that she is OLD. If the writer of The story of O was alive she would have sued that her amazing book has been reduced to this...this is basically twilight mashed badly with the story of o. its a sham and just like this stupid modern culture that allows Kim kardashian to be famous and miley cyrus to sell records so these kinds of trash makes it to the bookshelves and to the movies and does well and nurtures the ongoing success of bad mass produced books and movies that make younger generations stupider and stupider.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Bad, just plain bad.","So, I read the book up to the contract and was disgusted. Thinking back on my own age, I don't give a damn who you are a girl who has never done an ounce of anything would not be up for this extreme sex. She wouldn't be able to walk, nor go for a next round right after. It's completely crap.Now for the movie itself, I watched it because most times movies don't follow the books very well. I watched this and some parts were sexy and others not so much, such as the beatings. Yes, the guy was pretty sexy and had a sexy voice. However, what I was expecting was a lot more ravishing I guess. No woman is going to be aroused by this, some parts yes like what he says.I knew all along that when people who are into ""rape"" themed sex on paper saw this, they might rethink that after seeing that crap with their own eyes. The plot was just bad, all in all can this film. Scrap all the sequels and move on.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Can't believe I have to give it one star,"""You're going to Georgia for one day??? Why didn't you tell meeee????""*hits her* *she cries*""You're MINE. ALL MINE!!

I was bored and I had a couple hours to kill so I thought I could have a laugh and stream the movie online. I was wrong. It was so upsettingly boring that I had to create an account, and write to warn everybody not to watch this ""movie"". Seriously, donate your money to some charity, don't waste it on a ticket.The actress has really horrible bags under her eyes and disgusting armpits. seriously, a 5 o'clock shadow on your armpits is not sexy. just like everything else in this movie.Was the guy only casted because he is a former model? because I can't think about any other reason. He has abs. Nothing else. My bald landlord could have more sex appeal than this guy.Oldest story in the book. Boy meets girls. He's a millionaire, she's a virgin.They have no chemistry whatsoever. I rather see my dog groping the sofa cushions.About the ""sexy talk"", they might as well had been talking about ikea furniture.Ana makes her orgasm moans as soon as the guy takes her panties off. Ridiculous.Im not a BDSM expert, but I understand that its all about consent. If I were into BDSM, I would be insulted.He's creepy and he stalks her, she has no common sense or brains....I wanted to continue this list, but just like when watching the movie, I got really bored.The movie (or better, the trilogy) should have ended with the scene where Ana is crying (after he hit the sh*t out of her) and she says: ""Don't you dare come near me""",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Man, you swallowed those blue pills faster than any previous victim","If the title 50 Shades of Grey, aside from the obvious play off a character name, is meant to imply some sort of moral ambiguity or complexity on the subject of love, sex, and kink, then there is definitely a case for a class action law suit here.Full disclosure: I have not read the book. I know some who have read it, in full and in part. The impression I got from what talk I heard of the book was that it was just an unusually successful dirty book. I'm male, I have access to the internet, and don't feel enough of a sense of guilt over my dirty thoughts to have to dress them up in a story to read to give them good taste. Now, for the romantically inclined who are rolling their eyes right now, I beg you to not misunderstand me. I do have a sense of romance, and can enjoy a romantic story. If the movie is any kind of reflection on the book, however, you won't find any romance there. That isn't itself a bad thing if the movie is just serving to scratch an erotic itch for you. I'm willing to bet this movie will fail miserably in that department for you as well.The principle issue with this movie as romance is both characters seem to suffer from some form of personality disorder. Our male lead, the not-so-secretly kinky billionaire Christian Grey, is supposed to be the archetype of the bad boy the female gets to ""fix"" and settle down with but this aspect of his character is handled with no grace at all. The script literally has him telling us that characterizations of him being heartless are based on just simple fact. He warns her, in about three different ways, that he and the whole love thing don't mix. He's in the market for a sex slave and¬Ö he is more than willing to engage in polite and professional negotiations about it while he cuddles with you in the bath, and takes you to dinner with his family. Aside from the contradictions, he also suffers from Twilight syndrome in that most of his words and actions would be huge red flags that would have any woman reaching for a Taser or panic whistle and running.Not a problem for the sheltered Anastasia Steele. (Excuse me as I groan every time I speak that name). Upon meeting the apparently dreamy Grey she offers very little hesitation in the ""play room"" and seems to be having a good time in the steamy scenes¬Ö that she judges him intensely for because they are painful and demeaning. There is the most hilarious example of this that I can't even give you as it would qualify as a spoiler being essentially the end of the film.If you wanted to see this film because of the sexual content, lower your expectations. The movie is rated R, there is nudity and simulated sex. Most of the ""kink"" is in dialog, and the two actors have zero chemistry with each other. The lack of chemistry combined with awkward and questionable character behavior throw a cold shower on any eroticism. One odd note, if you're a straight male whose girl wants you watch this with her, don't worry, it was directed by a straight guy who apparently had little regard for this movie's target audience. It suffers terribly from male gaze, as the camera is on the woman way more than the man. As I said though, it's little comfort as the scenes just don't work. I watched this with a friend and we were hoping the much cuter guy who shows up for a few seconds in one scene in the hardware store would appear again.To readers who have seen this movie, can someone help me? There is a scene where Anastasia wakes to find ""eat me"" and ""drink me"" signs on the bed side table, and the ""eat me"" tray looks like it has big blue pills. Are these pills? Are they candy? Can someone tell me what they are? I've never seen anything like it and I certainly wouldn't have popped them in my mouth without a second thought! Is this a Matrix sequel? Seriously, the blue pills are bothering me!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,What a joke,Don't waste your money or time. This movie is disappointing in every way. Starts trying to be a love movie between a rich guy and a college student and 15 minutes later it's all about nudity BDSM and terrible unromantic rough sex.The WOMAN'S DIGNITY IS EXPLOITED TO THE MAX BY A RICH GUY WHO HAS SERIOUS SEXUAL ISSUES AND THE MOVIE TRIES TO ADDRESS THOSE SEXUAL BDSM ISSUES AND THE WOMAN TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS RICH GUY IS SO SEXUALLY PERVERTED. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NICE LOVE STORY BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE THAT IS SO ROMANTIC ON VALENTINE'S DAY YOU CAN FORGET IT.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Terrible film!,"When the books first came out, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. The way in which these books are written is simply terrible. Poor effort. Although an okay storyline.I agreed to go and watch Fifty Shades of Grey yesterday, feeling a little dubious I must admit. I felt that they spent a lot of the time playing music which didn't really even fit the scenes. Then moments which were meant to feel sexy and seductive, had the opposite effect and made everyone cringe in the cinema. Some were actually laughing at how ridiculous the whole thing was.I really didn't think it could be any worse than the books, but yet it was. I suggest watching the film, so that you can see for yourself how horribly made it was. This film could have been so much more if they tried harder. Worst film I have seen in a very long time.My friend and I actually felt uncomfortable the whole way home after watching this.Also, Christian Grey was a terrible actor in this, Anastasia at least tried on her part",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Expected. Terrible book, terrible movie","Worst things: Terrible cast - No chemistry between the actors, I think they hate each other. But we as public are talking about them, is not their fault. Is THE DIRECTOR and PRODUCERS FAULT!!! and now that face of this disaster are Dakota and James.....let's be fair.The movie is a ""sunday afternoon movie"", for young girls that don't know nothing about sex, life and any experience. BUT, let's be clear. THAT IS WHAT THE BOOK IS!! No more than that. A fairy tale of the Prince Charming with money and a little bit hot?I read the books, expecting for something else, looks like wrote it a teenager with 15 years old. And of course, I pay for them, and contribute with the success and crazy sales. Even when doesn't like me. The same with movie.Is a shame that Hollywood spend a lot a money in a movie like that, That could be a better movie, better than the book. And we are NOT talking about a Hard Porn.Can you imagine with Christian Bale (remember him in American Psycho) and let's say...figure it out. When Matt Boomer was chosen was better, good actor and good looking, and young...like the book wanted.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,No chemistry!,"Pro (there is one): pretty cinematography Cons: lifeless, bland, no chemistry between the main characters, corny lines, horrible writing, boring, weird casting choices, very few and tame sex scenes, insincere and forced ""passion"" and bad actingMy fianc√© and I wasted our Valentine's Day night watching this. There were times in the movie where the dialogue or the line was so corny that the entire movie theater laughed. I had relatively high expectations for the movie. I read the 3 books a few years ago. While they certainly reeked of Bella and Edward, and poorly written erotica, this movie is worse. It was so boring. A very poor adaption of an already poorly thought out story.Jamie Dornan was not good a fit for Christian Grey. I have see him in a few other things and enjoy his work. I'm not sure if it was the writing or him, but everything he said came out awkward and overly rehearsed. The American accent did not work great for him either. Dakota Johnson I did not really like either for this role. I have never seen her in many thing else but while she fits the character of Ana more than Jamie fits Christian, I feel like her acting was not great. Everyone else in this filmed absolutely sucked at acting as well (or maybe it was the poor screenplay - I don't know). I noticed they took a lot of stuff verbatim from the book - it was a lot better left on paper. A lot of the lines, like I said, just sounded unnatural and weird.One thing this movie lacked a lot of was the natural grace and realistic dialogue that good acting has. The actors and the screenplay sounded very unrealistic and nothing anyone would ever actually say in real life. It was just not relatable - it totally missed that very important aspect of believability and naturalness. Everything sounded over produced and scripted.This movie also has one of the most severe cases of lack of chemistry that I have ever seen between two main love interest characters. I didn't feel like it was believable at all that they liked each other. It felt like a lot of weird fake forced passion from Christian's end and again just really unnatural.Not to mention, the movie was super boring, even more so than the book. The plot seemed very predictable and I am not exactly sure where the climax of the movie was supposed to be. I guess the end - but it was a pretty dry climax.Neither my boyfriend or I enjoyed this movie and I feel like I wasted my money. Way over hyped. There are no real redeemable qualities about the actors, writing, sex or anything else that a good movie has. I do applaud the great marketing campaign this movie committed to for most of 2014. Unfortunately it was a lot of hype for a major let down. I really wanted to like it but it is probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 shades of ABUSE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is a tale of stalking, domestic violence, abuse, and torture, dressed up like a love story! My honest to god biggest fear of 50 Shades of Grey is not that people will watch it, because people will, but that abusers will use it to brainwash their victims more than they already do. That more women will be left wondering why this isn't making them happy when it's suppose to. And more women will be hurt in worse ways because ""this is what everyone else wants."" If someone you care about likes 50 Shades of Grey, ask them if they would be okay with you being in a relationship like that. Ask them what they would do if you came to them and told them your boyfriend is controlling what you eat, what you wear, what you do, and is making you do sex acts you aren't comfortable with. Ask them what they would say if you told them that a man you just met is stalking you at work. Ask them what you should do if a man tries to get you to sign a consent form for sex or asks you to marry him 5 weeks after meeting him. See what they say.6 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Wasted Time and Limited BDSM Knowledge,"Couple years ago managed to force myself through the first book to see what the fuss was about. I have literally read fanfictons with more substance and far better sex scenes. Went to see the movie with my sister to see if they'd managed to adapt it into something tolerable. They haven't.The movie is just as awful. Bland. Dull. Absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads, which is sort of important in a supposed 'romance' movie, I was very tempted to leave less than halfway through and get a refund. The plot is very almost non existent, there's no logical explanation for Grey wanting Ana, there's no VALID back story for the reason Christian is ""F*ed up"", extremely limited character building and no substance.The script is beyond poor, some lines that were supposed to be sexy were downright laughable and there were awkward laughs shared by people in the cinema on more than one occasion. The acting was wooden (I've seen my younger brother act more convincingly) and both leads were far from arousing, even to one another it seemed.And for those of you who have looked extensively through the reviews on here, I'd like you to know that the men and women who have rated this higher than a 3* and claim to see no abuse, have probably never participated or even looked up the BDSM community.The consent in this movie (if you can call it that) is questionable at best, and the fact that he doesn't even CONSIDER her input and tentativeness towards some things in his contract shows that. He tries to OWN her. He stalks her and controls everything she does from the moment they meet. That is not a consensual relationship. That is abuse. It sickens me that young women BELIEVE that this sort of behavior is OK.BDSM is nothing like anything in this movie. In a BDSM consensual relationship EVERYTHING is on the subs terms. Absolutely everything. If the sub says stop, you stop. If the sub is happy, you're happy. If the sub says no, you don't push it. What Ana and Christian exhibit is a controlling, manipulative relationship, please look up BDSM and be safe if you're wanting to try and spice up your love life. DON'T USE THIS MOVIE (OR THE BOOKS) AS A LEAD BY EXAMPLE.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Pointless movie, promotes women being used","OK I am open minded, but this is the worst movie i have seen in a long time.Rich guy beds girl and uses her. That's the movie.Why anyone would like this is questionable...? Basically the use of women as a sex slave. Is everyone who likes this messed up? A throw back to 1920's use of women who have no mind of their own. Those poor girls who are brainwashed into loving their captives is all I see.If it's ture women like this... then there is no hope for the human raceThe only point within the film, which is ture to life is the mother part coming in half way though...3 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Chloroform In Print = Chloroform In Celluloid,"The emperor has no clothes. Or rather he does, they're just really really dull.Behold the sexploitation film. The bottom of the barrel in exploitation sub genres. And it's a deep barrel! Sexploitation is just one step short of outright porn. Except sexploitation doesn't rate as high a porn. At least pornography gratifies its audience. But 'Fifty Shades' doesn't even rate as high sexploitation.Behold the great American novel, the bottom of the barrel in print. Based on the recent successes of 'Twilight' and 'The DiVinci Code' and 'The Hunger Games' (the first novel to ever advertise itself as being plagiarized) the American reader is dumb as rocks. Raised on 'Sweet Valley High' and 'The Babysitters' Club' the American reader cannot be expected to comprehend any type plot, character development, or writing prose. It has to be dumbed down, mashed up, and spoon fed to them.When I first heard about the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' novels I was just as much up for (no puns intended) some good erotic fiction as any other reader. I read the first twenty pages of a bootleg version before I fell asleep. To sum it up in a single word it was ""juvenile."" It read like stereo instructions, as if the words had merely been randomly assembled by a computer program rather than a typing monkey.The mere names of the characters are laughable. Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele? Seriously? Were the names Hester Prynne and Seymour Butts already taken? How can any reader take this seriously after reading those names?The setting is equally as cardboard. An office. Move over 'Claiming of Sleeping Beauty' this erotic novel takes place in an office.So no matter what your personal tastes the last thing you want anything to be is boring. That's what 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is, boring and juvenile.Then came the media sensation! The novels were plugged left and right as being ""erotic"" and ""controversial."" As I already stated they're as ""erotic"" as stereo instructions and the claim of controversy would be more convincing if these novels weren't SOLD AT THE CHECKOUT LINE IN GROCERY STORES!!! Come on! How ""controversial"" can it be?Finally last night I chose to embrace the horror and get it over with and finally watch a bootleg version of this movie. How bad could it possibly be? I figured, if I could endure 'Cannibal Holocaust' 'Cannibal Ferox' 'Riki Oh' 'Salo' and ALL THREE 'ILSA' movies I could certainly survive this.I braced myself (no puns intended) for this ""controversial"" ""shocking"" ""erotic thriller"" which barely got an R rating to see..... bare breasts. That's right! The most shocking scenes in the movie feature bare breasts. That's it!!! That's the big ""shocker!"" Bare breasts! Dakota Johnson's flat as a board bare breasts. I can name PG movies that feature bare breasts!Staying true to the novel it was boring as sin. Well I guess I should have expected as much.This only reinforces what I've said all along. Who is the target audience here? There's no shortage of actual porn. And porn fans will be bored to tears. The only way they'd enjoy this is if the role of Anastasia Steele was played by Tanner Mayes and the role of Christian Grey was played by ten black men.At the same time other people won't be interested in seeing this trash. So who was the target audience to begin with?'Fifty Shades' is pure hype built on nothing. The emperor has no clothes. Or rather he does, they're just really really dull.I was very saddened to learn that this film was produced by Michael De Luca. The Michael De Luca? The same screen writer of one of the greatest films ever made 'In The Mouth of Madness'? Now I hate 'Fifty Shades of Grey' even more!",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Very good book, awful movie",I am a big fan of the book trilogy. The director Sam Taylor Johnson did an amateur work. There is more sexual tense in Gone with the wind between Rhett and Scarlett than in 50 shades of Grey. We can not see any feelings between Anastatsia and Christian. The film is showing unrelated scenes without any transitions. This is as if the director would have taken out of the book some chapters without being able to link them. Jamie Dornan is unable to show any feeling. We can neither see on his face nor on his body how attracted he is to his partner. He is spoiled.We started a petition to stop the damages. It would be a shame if she would be allowed to direct the adaptations of the two other novels.8 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Movie for gold diggers,"Worst movie I have ever seen. This movie is perfect for gold diggers. Rate 1/10. Boring. The movie is about sex. BDSM. It seemed like the creators only wanted to dwell upon that, but unfortunately had to create some background story, because you don't get directly to sex, you get porno if you do. So all the plot is extremely weak and its only purpose is to provide the terms for sex. Characters behave unrealisticaly, they do unreasonable and random stuff, they get horny by looking and each other lips etc. You might think ""Well, I bet at least the sex scenes themselves are cool"". No, they are not. They are neither appealing, nor horryfying, nor passionate. They are lame and boring. The deep breathing, fist clenching, shouting etc. seem out of place for there is no real cause for them. And it gets more and more random. During one of the final scenes which were supposed to be extremely dramatic and make viewers cry the entire cinema hall started to clap and burst into laughs because what was happening on the screen was random, illogical and simply stupid.4 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Dog Excrement.,"I have a feeling that the director tried so hard to salvage this movie but the author is too stubborn so in the end the director just gave up.A CRAP movie from a CRAP book. Even the actors hated it.Ôªø I doubt they'll get the writer and the director back. E.L. James wants to write the sequel and Taylor-Johnson has expressed her dislike for James countless times. Heck everyone in the production expressed their dislike with James's micro managing.To all the guys reading this who actually have girlfriends: If she wants to see this movie, it's time for you to be that control freak she seems to lustfully desire, and tell her, ""There is no way in heaven or hell we are going to see this movie. Are you insane? No."" Draw a line in the sand, and go see something like Kingsman, or even the Spongebob movie. I'm serious. I would give -1 but that's not possible.Worst movie ever.

The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything.""4 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades Of Garbage,"It finally was filmed. A movie with absolutely no storyline what so ever. A movie that has made over a half a billion dollars due to the post advertising of the film and the writing of the book. I never read the book but did go to the movie to see what all the hype was about. I can say this was one of the worse movies made. A plain girl who draws the attention of a billionaire. A weird billionaire at that. He leads her into the dark world of whips,leather belts and sexual games. And that IS the entire movie. I went to the premiere and the stadium seating was totally filled from the bottom to the top. At the end of the movie I thought there was going to be a riot in the theater. Everyone,and I mean everyone, started talking, yelling, swearing at once. The young man next to me stood up, looked down at his girl friend and said ""I told you this movie was going to be a piece of crap...but you had to go!"" A half empty box of popcorn when flying to the screen stage. If you remember the final show of that great HBO series the ""Sopranos""..be prepared. The movie is total trash and I am not a stranger to movies of this type. Entertaining it was not. There was a much better 8-10 minute sex scene in JLo's movie ""The Boy Next Door"" that was far more sexier then this entire movie. And face it,that's what you went to see. Jamie Dornan (Gray) has said in an interview he will NOT be appearing in the sequel at the request of his wife. Ya..good play Mr. Dornan..until they put a $20,000,000 pay check in front of you. I'd have said the same thing to up that paycheck too. Based on the what I seen and heard I would be willing to bet the sequel won't make as near as much as this film did. Those who haven't seen it as of date...save your money. It's a stinker from beginning to end.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,-50 Shades of Charisma,"I cannot believe I persevered with this truly dire film, hoping at some point it would redeem itself. No such luck unfortunately, minutes of my life I'll never get back. The leads had zero charisma or chemistry, and with such a poor script I guess it's no surprise, so the writers can shoulder some of the blame.Really speaking though, while it would have been somewhat predictable casting 'known' more suitable leads, it would have at least made things a tad more bearable. I suppose the dilemma is finding Hollywood 'A-list's', that are willing to gamble their career.Anyway to sum it up: creepy, icky, awkward, unconvincing, z-movie, lame, wooden, worse than 'Show Girls' (rating-wise; as I thankfully haven't seen that pile of poo), actors & film crew who must've thought OMG have I really involved myself in such an embarrassingly bad project (oh heck at least I'm getting paid loads), Thunderbirds puppets delivered lines more convincingly and had oodles more presence, worse accents than Dick Van Dyke (""Chitty bang-bang, chitty chitty bang-bang!"" üòÅ), unsexy, not a jot of romance, more cringe worthy than watching your folks getting frisky. In a nutshell, the next time someone asks me to watch this, I'll poke them in the eye with a sharp stick as they're certainly no friend of mine.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,"BDSM? Nah, just Chick-Flick through and through","Thank God I'm not the only one here thinking the movie was horrid. I really hate to admit it, but it was even worse than Breaking Dawn, despite being equally horrid. At least Breaking Dawn has an actual plot, but I think I've heard Fifty Shades'plot somewhere else, like, it's oozing in every adult-romance novels there is. The only difference that those chick flicks dealt with normal sexual preference instead of BDSM.When I first heard about BDSM theme of the novel (haven't read it), I thought it'd be about a BDSM maniac guy and his one hell of twisted life. But, after watching the first half of the movie, I thought, ""What the hell? It's nothing twisted, it's totally chick- flick!""I'm never a big-fan of chick-flicks, and it's hard to determine which one's more irrational; zombie's falling in love, sparkling- skinned vampire, or impeccably gentleman-like BDSM maniac. I think I'd opt for the last to be the most impossible. Yup, bottom line.I don't understand what the big fuss people were talking about this movie. Honestly, after the first half of the movie, I practically sleeping in the second half. It's everything to be expected from a chick-flicks; a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy falling in love (well, maybe, since I never read the novels and most likely would never, thanks to this infernal movie) with an innocent young woman and (most likely) would change him someday. *yawn* It's too chick-flicks, I can barely stand it.Acting aside, they're just as wooden as Kristen Stewart, everybody could see that. For me, it's nothing more than a delusional fantasy of every girl. Well, who wouldn't fall for a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy even if he's a maniac? You get a new car, new laptop, a room that you could decorate all you want, and a romantic date every weekend. And then you get to have your own personal health-monitor and not to be afraid of venereal disease when you're having 'fun' with said guy. Now, sparkling-skinned vampire becoming even more and more realistic. Blah...Honestly, I prefer sparkling-skinned vampire. Sure, both guys are impeccably gentleman-like. But the vampire was consistent throughout the movie(s), while the BDSM maniac doesn't even sit well with his own contract. It's just doesn't make sense.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Thomas Crown meets the Secretary.,"My wife read the books and liked them enough to drag me to this film on opening weekend. I wasn't expecting much since the reviews had been pouring out - no male frontal, in France they are letting their 10 y/o's go see this film, etc.Don't know this E.L. James author, but she isn't a Danielle Steele by any means. Sam Taylor- Johnson? She won the lottery when she married the kid from Kick Ass so I guess she doesn't care what she puts on film for people to watch.The producers should have never let E.L. have that much control over a script. Did anyone see the Secretary with James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhall? Did anyone see the remake of Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce Brosnan? It seems like those two films got merged and made into this pile of whatever it was.I've heard the novels were plenty more graphic, so if that was the case, slap an NC-17 rating on it and get some actors that can act and make the film E.L. James wrote.I think the downfall of this film started with the casting - the guy from Sons of Anarchy was the wrong choice and then he dropped out from so much negative review and then they bring in Don Johnson's daughter and the British guy.The script was shameful. I've watched porn online that has better dialog. The cinematography was horrific. I could go on about how much technical stuff, the things that actually still mean something when you make a film are terrible.Don't waste your money. I wouldn't even rent it at home to be honest.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Awful acting / poor story line / over hysterically hyped,"It seems the hype around this series of books and the hysterical blind following by women has led to them giving an awful movie 10/10 I wish I could give -10 to balance this but a 1 is the minimum.A film portraying a tycoon seducing a young women...OK if he was on the dole shed run a mile... a torture room OK weirdo I'm outa here but he's a billionaire so its different? Romance? 24/7 contract on a relationship, phone tapping, stalking, rape and violence..I fear for society if people vote this 10/10 its everything that is wrong in a relationship.People at the cinema actually laughed at the wooden acting and the corny lines ..Awful simply awful and demeaning to women who fought so hard for equality... the list of what she wont do and what he wanted to do is disgusting..After this film number 2 and 3 will have little following.. should have little following",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A film about rape and debasement,"I read the first book and hated the heroine from the get-go ... I gathered the gumption to finish the book 'till the end, thinking that maybe, just maybe it'd get better. But sweet mother of Zeus it didn't. It just went downhill from there. The main character is moronic. The writing style is vapid.The film? It didn't do any better. Is the world really out of fresh and good ideas that there is no choice but to make a movie from a book that is so irresponsibly written? On average, 1000 men die from BDSM every year and this doesn't include the women. This statistic is only in the US. Think about it, people. What's so wonderful about that? And if you still don't believe me, here are comments from people who are PRACTICING THIS LIFESTYLE... and I quote:""I am a dominant currently in a relationship with a submissive. I feel quite offended that this movie portrays our lifestyle so negatively! BDSM is supposed to please BOTH... 50 Shades of Grey is a terrible way to educate society of what BDSM is all about.""Here's another one:""I watched the movie with my girlfriend on Saturday and criticized it the whole way through. It DISGUSTED me how they portrayed us. I really wish I hadn't watched it. Society already has a negative view on BDSM and now rubbish like this is released. It's really sad.""Here's another:""It was about glamorized ABUSE and RAPE. All the other people I know in the lifestyle are APPALLED at this portrayal of BDSM. It creates a false illusion of a real lifestyle.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,it's worse than twilight,"i've been with my friends to see this movie, excepting the fact that there was crowded and i should wait like one hour to buy some nachos. i have to admit that the only two things good at this movie were the soundtracks and the pr strategy, because they were able to make the people to want to go see that movie after they saw the trailer. i've read the book as well and it was not a well written book, i mean i've read books like this before and i've seen better. so i hoped that the movie would be better, because i don't think it's to hard to change a few things and spike the things a little bit up. but i was wrong, because it all turned up to be a real disaster. i personally can't understand how a big film studio like universal would sell a movie like thins. anyway, except the fact that there was no actions or climax, the actors played awful, i think i could do it better myself, the very acting so unnatural especially Christian Grey. i also don't find it OK the fact that people over 15 can see this movie, because we all know that there are a lot of teenagers girls who don't know much what sex means or what life means, and i think that they can be very easy manipulated to do the same things like Ana and Christian did. don't get me wrong, i'm totally OK and i agree the fact that there are people who do things like this and i don't want to offend them, i just think that people should be old enough to know exactly that this is something they want to try and do.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,ewwww,"the adverts made it look amazing, they hype surrounding it made it seem amazing, that actual movie made it awfulnever have i seen such boring acting, even the line 'mr Grey will see you now' is just awful and she couldn't have sounded more bored saying it, the only truly amazing thing i saw in the whole movie was a bunch of excited 18-25 year old women walking in with huge grins and leaving in horror as they had just realised that their sexual fantasy does not stretch that far. It was cute their sex at the start but the second he put the tie on her wrists i just got weird.in conclusion i am pretty sure there are websites on the internet which have better quality bondage then this and you don't have to pay ¬£15 for it!!!5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disgusting Movie,"Nope, not because of any sex scene, I actually did not find any of the scenes erotic on it any way. Nope, not because there is BDSM on it, I actually did not find any believable BDSM on it any way. Nope, not because the movie degrades or not, women, or men, I actually did not find any hint of a real women or men on it any way.Disgusting because the poor, poor, performances.Disgusting because the lack of (even one) credible scene, plot or history.Disgusting because the massive marketing that promotes a movie that delivers nothing but an attempt to fool us all thinking we will be entertained for a while, but in practice reveals an array of careless directing, production, acting and writing, with the only purpose to take our money and run with it. Just like the book (as it seems by looking at other reviews).",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Sadly misconstrued on the subject matter - Disappointing,"Utterly horrible movie, completely misconstrued, making the whole Dominant/submissive relationship appear abusive and coming from a place of hate when it is quite the opposite.I cannot believe I anticipated this movie as much as I did, I should have read the book to see what a complete joke the entire thing is.This should have been about connection, bonding, a deeper meaning between the two, the freedom of giving yourself wholly to another, of letting go in a safe and trusted environment.Mr. Grey's wealth has no point or bearing on the subject matter, how could this even have gotten nearly the hype it did except to people who are ignorant of the subject matter, who think such a relationship is unhealthy when they couldn't possibly know what the REAL thing is even about...Sadly disappointed :(",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Awful awful awful!!,"Firstly, I can't get over how cringe worthy bad this movie was. I had very low expectations because I didn't think the books were that great but I didn't expect the movie to be so shocking! Five minutes into the movie I knew I would hate it. The icing on the cake was the scene after she interviews Christian and he says ""Anastasia"" at the elevator, it sounded so put on and fake. And I found this through the whole movie.The acting is horrible and wooden. The main actors American accent is SO bad. He can't keep the accent up so very often during the movie he slips up. The girl is slightly better but still bad. The two of them have absolutely no chemistry. None at all. The lack of chemistry is what makes so many of the scenes laughable. She looks very old for her age and she looks tired most of the movie. I found all the acting scenes put on and I couldn't take one scene seriously. I spent majority of the time laughing out loud. The only reason I didn't leave the cinema is because my friend paid for my ticket. Oh and I went to go get some extra food to get myself through the second half of the movie. The sex scenes.. well because the two leads had no chemistry and can't act, I found myself laughing and cringing again.And who the frek cast Rita Ora in this movie? Bahaha.I would rather not give this movie even a 1. But I can't score any lower. Dreadful, dreadful dreadful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Gag!!,"I read the reviews before I watched it and I thought I'd give it a chance and maybe just maybe everyone else was being really mean because it was ""mainstream"" to hate this movie. Well, I was wrong. It truly and undoubtedly is an awful film. I don't understand how it had enough funding to actually be filmed and produced. Who the hell would put their money into a film like this? It's truly the worst movie I've ever watched. Even the sex scenes (more like rape scenes) were just disgusting. I didn't find myself even remotely interested in what was going on. Hell, I feel even worse for making my husband watch it with me. it was a waste of two hours of my life that i'll never get back. Seriously, do not watch this movie. No matter how hard you want to try to like it, you will not. It is horrendous.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon,"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY review by Mike SmithLiterature student Anastasia Steele's life changes forever when she meets handsome, yet tormented, billionaire Christian Grey.When I write a review I try to find at least one good thing about every movie. That being said, Fifty shades of grey had NOTHING to contribute to my cinematic love. The cast is terrible; Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have no on screen chemistry. They don't keep us interested in the film because they can't act. At one point Charlie Hunnam was attached to play the main role of Christian Gray and after wasting a hour and fifty minutes on this abortion I really think he would have brought some acting to this train wreck. The writing is crap and Christian Gray came off more like a stalker and a creeper. Anastasia Steele seems like she is slow and dumb. One thing that pisses me off about this movie is that if Christian Gray was just an average guy, not a billionaire, the tone of the movie would be completely different. The music is just dark ominous tones or crappy covers of songs.And let's not forget the sex scenes, there is nothing special about any of it. So what, you see her boobs not a big deal, but the sex parts (which is what the books are built upon) are nothing to be excited about. I should have just watched a real porno! There would have been a better story and much better acting. It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon. Cheers and remember I watch the crappy movies so you don't have too.0.5 out of 10edited by Samantha LockeTwitter: FatMikeTPKFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"sex scenes are lame, plot is ignorant and insulting","A baser reason one might watch this is to see the sex scenes, but even those are disappointing. The BDSM stuff that is actually shown is the kind that non-kinky folks might try just to be mix things up a bit in the bedroom. When I hear about places banning or cutting scenes, I wonder if the filmmakers encouraged this to build a rep. There are loads of better sources for bondage scenes out there, making this movie totally worthless in that department.Now it would be interesting to explore the dynamic that might result if two people fell in love where one of them is way into BDSM and the other is categorically turned off by that stuff. It would be cool to see love set against an irresolvable sexual preference in that way, and to explore the process of discovering how much trust and respect between people is really involved in BDSM stuff. Unfortunately this movie doesn't do those things.Instead, the film tries to convince us that the only reason someone might be into dominance role-playing is if he's a controlling selfish jerk who is not capable of love. The movie's only victory is a completely failure to communicate, both between the characters on screen, and between the filmmakers and their subject matter.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,WHAT the Heck !?!,"Well, this is my first review here, as I never felt I wanted to share my thoughts about movies publicly, until this very moment... Gosh, this film was very brutal and I do not mean sex scenes. Broadly speaking, actors, dialogs and all that jazz came across rather fake and completely unnatural.. not mentioning the plot with the contract and T&C's... what? Even the sex scenes seemed not interesting, you usually get much saucy stuff in movies for 15's! SO over all folks, such a waste of time... The only, ONLY decent thing in this movie was music.. that's all and I really mean it... SO if they plan to shot a second episode, than I am moving to Moon... I am giving this film ONE star and that is only because I cannot give it a ZERO!! :)7 out of 17 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,What a pile of rubbish,"I only gave the film a 1 star rating, as i can't give it no stars, unfortunately. The books were infinitely better than this mediocre rubbish, which begins with a warning of ""strong sex"" If the film had been intended as a comedy- it would have failed anyway; though the crowds of girls & women who found parts hysterically funny ( for no reason I could fathom, unless large quantities of alcohol had been imbibed first) ( which might be the best foreplay to watching this movie. The ""sex"" was tame to nonexistent, the characters, for the most part, were in-believable, and the script so generic it defied belief. When I read the first book, i HAD to follow up with the second, and then third, immediately.Needless to say, the hype will only catch me once; I expect the next two films to flop dramatically, once the public know what they aren't going to get for their money.Don't waste your time or money.8 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Worst movie experience ever !,"Before I begin talking about this ''movie'', let me clarify a few things- I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. I watch movies everyday. When I finished watching this ''movie'', I felt so angry. Let's begin by talking about everything that's wrong with this ''movie''.The screenplay is god awful, the story is damn awful, the characters are stupid and laughably bad, the first half is laughably bad and the second is just painful to watch, the editing is absolutely stupid, the directing is awful, the female protagonist is the weakest character I've ever seen in my life, the entire movie is so clich√© and atrocious, the sex scenes are boring and awful, the main character is called Anastasia Steele (the worst name I've ever heard), not a single frame is interesting or worth watching, you don't care for the characters even for a small second, all the characters except the protagonist and Mr. BDSM are useless and add absolutely nothing to the film, even the original song for the movie is not featured but a instead a remake, I laughed so hard when a curtain dialog happened, the ending was the best part because the credits finally showed up so I could breath for a moment, and this movie's so bad I actually refuse to call this ''movie'' by it's original name- for me right now it's called ''Fifty Shades Of Bullshit''.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,An insult to the BDSM world...,"Frankly, I'm not sure that there is a rating low enough to accurately describe Fifty Shades of Grey. Universal Pictures and Focus Features, along with producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti took E.L. James' badly written book series and made them into bad movies.The only reason that Fifty Shades of Grey gained the amount of attention and popularity that it did was because the subject matter is considered by the general public to be taboo. Taken as a whole, the books and films are a colossal insult to and a highly inaccurate of the entire BDSM community.If Christian Grey were a real person, he would be shunned by the community. The author portrays him a being mentally unstable and controlling in a completely non-consensual manner.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Noooooooooooo,"People seem to realize that this movie is bad. Horrible, even. But that's not the real question; no, the real question is: Is this movie worse than cancer? Well...at least with cancer you die. Everything about this movie is wrong. The acting is wrong. The script is wrong. The sex is wrong in all the wrong ways. At one point, Christian states that ""I don't make love. ""I f***. Hard."". He promptly ties her up and makes love to her. Christian, I hate to be the bringer of bad news here, but just because you tied her up does invalidate your love making. There wasn't even a point to her being tied aside from ""oooh look at our edgy, kinky sex"". But it wasn't. It was pretending to be. The most accurate plot summary of this movie would be ""a compulsive liar pretends to be a sadist and is constantly on the brink of tears about it."".6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Thank GOD the tampon scene wasn't in this movie.,"""""You'd kidnap me?"" ""Oh yes,"" he grins. ""Hold me against my will?"" Jeez this is hot."" - Definitely not rape, from 50 shades of grey.the 50 shades of grey movie was much less painful to experience than reading the horribly written, edited, and disturbing novel. This movie doesn't even extend into the ""Cult Classic"" category with it's nightmarish acting, horrific dialogue, and warped concept that offends the BDSM culture itself!""He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string¬Ö what! And¬Ö a gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet. Holy (bleep). Sweet mother of all¬Ö Jeez. And then he's inside me¬Ö ah!"" - True love, from 50 shades of grey.Acting: 1/10 - There's a lot of things that you can tell about a movie from the actors. During many interviews, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan express contempt for one another (if not the film itself). This followed into the movie. The acting seems almost robotic, lacking in personality.The gooey sexual content: 1/10 - Porn was never meant for mainstream theaters. This is another example on why. The book ventures into bizarre forms of paraphilia and gender abuse that readers can't seem to get enough of. While many were making their pants moist, or pitching a tent for the tampon scene, the film had to be heavily edited from the ""Fifty shades of sexual abuse"" guide, in order for it to enter into theaters.The atmosphere: 6/10 - The atmosphere along with the camera editing did indeed help make it slightly more tolerable. But what it didn't do, was keeping the men in the audience from laughing, saying ""This is just diluted porn"" to get up and walk away, or keep the women from sneaking out of the theater, hoping that nobody saw that they paid for it.Overall: 1/10 - Porn is porn, whether we want to acknowledge it or not. There are many websites of men taking advantage of women and beating them while the woman says ""More please"" if that's what you're into. Attempting to add a storyline to porn doesn't often turn out well, and this goes double when you edit said porn and put it in mainstream media. This movie holds no stable plot to satisfy those who are seeking a good story, and it's offensive to women enough to spawn boycotting campaigns, it's offensive to the BDSM culture because it depicts a practitioner as being someone who takes advantage of their partner, and ultimately, there is absolutely no saving grace for this movie other than the tampon scene not being added. This movie holds no comedic value to compensate for its horrible performance in the sense that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" does, and it holds no strong plot, storyline, or acting for it to be taken seriously.""Next time you'll be in the cargo hold, bound and gagged in a crate."" -50 shades of greyThis movie will stand strong as being one of the largest money-makers this year, but its performance score will remain below the Spongebob Movie.Don't torment yourself by watching this movie, and don't give someone who gets work inspired by twilight your money. God Speed, ladies and gentlemen.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Sick Perverted DISGUSTING,I'm sorry but i feel sorry for the people who actually made the effort and wasted nothing but their time and threw money down the sewerage for a trash like this movie. The book was horrendous to say in the least and the writer should not even be acknowledged/regarded as a professional but perhaps the writer should seriously consider getting psychological help or perhaps save everyone the trouble and get admitted in the mental hospital. HOW CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S OK TO ABUSE Each other?????????? And this is NOT a romantic movie...love is so different than this S**T. I don't want to waste my time or energy on describing how sick this is and the idiots actually had the audacity to make a movie out of it....i wonder if the writer gave the same favors as described in the books to get the movie...6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disgusting,"So obvious to the audience that it is just a brushed of version of a 'Twilight' FanFiction. Just like 'Twilight' it portrays an abusive relationship, that for some reason people are going crazy over.Why anyone would want to watch the glorification of an abusive relationship is beyond me. The film degrades BDSM by not showing an accurate portrayal of what a BDSM relationship is actually like. Christian is not a Dom. There are countless times when he ignores Ana's requests to stop, or doesn't respect her boundaries. He also stalks her, like all the time.50 Shades also degrades women. It teaches people that when a woman says ""no"", it's okay for you to carry on. As if we don't have enough trouble having people believe women in our rape culture. I really feel for women who have had to live through abuse, such as the stuff shown in 50 shades, and then see their misery and pain blasted all over the media and portrayed as ""romantic.""",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Disappointment,"As an erotica fan, I find this movie insulting.Despite the book's literary shortcomings, the plot isn't that dreadful. However, in this movie the majority of the plot was abandoned. Having taken into account that producers would have to shorten the plot, they seem to have compressed it down by only, of course, using the 'saucy' parts. This may be what viewers have gone for, but the build up towards it has been taken out almost completely, which makes it hard to follow, and instantly makes the story less important and meaningful. It removes the romance and takes away what motive E. L. James decided to write the novel on.If I could've given this title 0/10 I would've. I guess the only thing I can offer with this one star is the soundtrack. Despite Elle Goulding's awful song.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Shockingly dull!,"To be honest, I never have high expectations of movies that generate so much hype before anyone even saw them, but sure I was curious to see what this is all about. I was stupid enough to think US producers finally came to terms with sexual topics but then again, it doesn't get any more dull than that. The acting and the entire cast are into this and they are trying their best to deliver some sort of performance, but the script is so shallow and the dialog so cheesy that I wonder how many people will be brave enough to ask for their money back as in the end you are left with a feeling of being totally ripped off by Hollywood! If you want to see some real taboo sexual topics, go watch an European production, cause nothing will even come out of the US without being hand picked for the entertained minds...shame this time there isn't even a hint of entertainment!9 out of 21 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Nothing Happens,"I really don't get the hype. The anti-rape/BDSM-butt-hurt floating around the media hype of this movie is absolutely ridiculous.The movie floats mostly around the theme of consent. It is actually a fairly decent, albeit far-fetched, interpretation of what BDSM can be or mean to people. Did people see Rocky and say ""This is a terrible representation of what boxing is."" Probably. And they were cast aside. See The Green Mile and say ""This is not what death row is like."" Probably. And it's one of the best movies of all time.That's actually what's disappointing about this movie (and the book, too, really) is that it could have been so much more. A seemingly taboo theme gets loads of attention; but it's so incredibly awfully made that no one particularly cares.The movie comes off as a soap opera, an episode of The Bachelor, and an excruciatingly soft (read here: barely explicit) porno all in one.While folks joked that they wouldn't be able to hear the movie over the din of vibrators; the loudest thing in the auditorium was actually countless men snoring, having been dragged along by their dangerously unfulfilled wives.I'm afraid it did not receive a rose. Fifty Shades gets a big 1/10, simply because IMDb does not permit a zero. Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Book way better,"The acting is awful, there's not chemistry between Dakota and Jamie, they look like they'r trying too hard to act. There's a lot of scenes on the book that they didn't put on the movie so that's why for me the movie is kinda boring and not as sexual as it needs to be, the movie isn't THAT sexual how everyone was saying, it has sex scenes just like a lot of movies that we have seen, nothing special so i'm disappointed.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of romanticised domestic abuse,"Right. First thing's first, before I launch into an enraged monologue, I will attempt to review Fifty Shades of Grey as a film, as this is technically a film review. It is awful. Not so-bad-it's- good awful. Not hilarious awful. Not even a friend made me watch it and I fell asleep awful. Actually awful. I have personally never seen either of the lead actors in anything else but I've seen better acting in the amateur dramatics plays in my local village after everyone's had six too many pints at the pub before the evening performance. Not that they can be entirely blamed of course, when the film (and, I'm assuming, the book, which I never intend to read) has utterly no plot and the writing is genuinely embarrassingly bad.So yes, the film is terrible, but now to the real issue. I had heard a lot of the controversy about this film and feel strongly about some of the issues raised, but felt as though I should watch the film so that my arguments would been grounded in actual knowledge, so as not to seem hypocritical or ill-informed. So I sat down and watched it. I can honestly say I have never been so traumatised in my life. To add some context, I am a great lover of horror films, and this film was the most terrifying experience of my life. I cried on multiple occasions during the film and when it finished, I sat in a state of shock for a whole ten minutes, my body shaking uncontrollably.As someone who has been a victim of domestic abuse in the past, I tend to avoid films that depict violence, control and emotional manipulation in the context of a relationship. Films such as these are usually marketed as psychological thrillers. Not romances. The way in which Fifty Shades was marketed genuinely appals me. The fact that audiences are being told that domestic abuse is not only acceptable because 'he had a tough childhood' but also romantic and desirably is utterly disgusting. It's not only unpleasant, distasteful and misogynistic, it goes much further than that. It is violating, insulting and most of all actually traumatic for people like me. For a film to bring back old memories of abuse is bad enough.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Pretty bad, pretty boring","Well... I saw this movie to discover what was so appealing in it that everyone was talking about it whether they've seen it or not, whether they've read the books or not. One of my friends - after she read the book - told me: I fall in love again, referring to Mr. Grey. So, yes, I was curious.Anyway, it was very disappointing. It was not about romance or even about sex - as everyone says - it's about controlling a person - Anastasia -, controlling every detail, every aspect of her life, even sex... and also telling her in many different ways that he wants to hurt her.The movie is bad. Boring, too long, no chemistry between the actors... The story is OK (so so). At least Anastasia is not as submissive as Grey wants but she tolerates a manipulative,jealous, controlling and abusive guy just because she wants him to love her... Sorry girl, that's no love.Leaving sex apart,it seems to be an apology for domestic violence with all those rewards and punishments.... and all those excuses for his behavior because he is a complex, traumatize man who has shades... No woman should tolerate a man like Mr Grey and, actually, it worries me that so many women have fallen ""in love again"", as my friend.I said before ""sex a part"" because I'm not judging neither it nor the practices the character have, that belongs to the intimacy in a couple but yet I judge the model of man that is making women crazy about in a time when so many is made to combat gender and domestic violence.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,So bad I created an account on this page to tell you.,"I've read the book, you maybe read it too. Remember how awful it was? Well... this is worse. A movie from a book written by a lonely woman who misses having sex and watches lots of porn. Remember when as a kid you stayed up just to see those shitty erotic movies from those shitty TV channels? That might give you an idea of what this is. The acting was really poor, zero chemistry, really forced faces and talking, awful accent by Jamie. Awkoward at times, really makes you want to leave. Well... maybe I went to far with that ""shitty erotic movie"" thing. This is actually worse, in those movies women are treated as... well, women. This movie shows Anastasia (Dakota) as a sex toy with long hair and beautiful eyes being abused in many ways. Some years before this would've make the director go to prison... or at least it would've made the same middle-aged women that now call this ""art"" being REALLY mad. This movie has nothing to sustain from, there's no ethical/philosophical theme brought to the table, just two people having sex, he abuses her, she tries to make him change with her ""love"". Really boring overused stuff.It doesn't get deeper than that. I really want to say something good about it, but I just can't, even the music was poor. A film that deserves to be played in those theaters that Travis Bickle (De Niro on Taxi Driver) used to go.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Nothing Happens,"I really don't get the hype. The anti-rape/BDSM-butt-hurt floating around the media hype of this movie is absolutely ridiculous.The movie floats mostly around the theme of consent. It is actually a fairly decent, albeit far-fetched, interpretation of what BDSM can be or mean to people. Did people see Rocky and say ""This is a terrible representation of what boxing is."" Probably. And they were cast aside. See The Green Mile and say ""This is not what death row is like."" Probably. And it's one of the best movies of all time.That's actually what's disappointing about this movie (and the book, too, really) is that it could have been so much more. A seemingly taboo theme gets loads of attention; but it's so incredibly awfully made that no one particularly cares.The movie comes off as a soap opera, an episode of The Bachelor, and an excruciatingly soft (read here: barely explicit) porno all in one.While folks joked that they wouldn't be able to hear the movie over the din of vibrators; the loudest thing in the auditorium was actually countless men snoring, having been dragged along by their dangerously unfulfilled wives.I'm afraid it did not receive a rose. Fifty Shades gets a big 1/10, simply because IMDb does not permit a zero. Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of romanticised domestic abuse,"Right. First thing's first, before I launch into an enraged monologue, I will attempt to review Fifty Shades of Grey as a film, as this is technically a film review. It is awful. Not so-bad-it's- good awful. Not hilarious awful. Not even a friend made me watch it and I fell asleep awful. Actually awful. I have personally never seen either of the lead actors in anything else but I've seen better acting in the amateur dramatics plays in my local village after everyone's had six too many pints at the pub before the evening performance. Not that they can be entirely blamed of course, when the film (and, I'm assuming, the book, which I never intend to read) has utterly no plot and the writing is genuinely embarrassingly bad.So yes, the film is terrible, but now to the real issue. I had heard a lot of the controversy about this film and feel strongly about some of the issues raised, but felt as though I should watch the film so that my arguments would been grounded in actual knowledge, so as not to seem hypocritical or ill-informed. So I sat down and watched it. I can honestly say I have never been so traumatised in my life. To add some context, I am a great lover of horror films, and this film was the most terrifying experience of my life. I cried on multiple occasions during the film and when it finished, I sat in a state of shock for a whole ten minutes, my body shaking uncontrollably.As someone who has been a victim of domestic abuse in the past, I tend to avoid films that depict violence, control and emotional manipulation in the context of a relationship. Films such as these are usually marketed as psychological thrillers. Not romances. The way in which Fifty Shades was marketed genuinely appals me. The fact that audiences are being told that domestic abuse is not only acceptable because 'he had a tough childhood' but also romantic and desirably is utterly disgusting. It's not only unpleasant, distasteful and misogynistic, it goes much further than that. It is violating, insulting and most of all actually traumatic for people like me. For a film to bring back old memories of abuse is bad enough. For that same film to convey that those experiences were not horrific but in fact romantic and exciting is utterly unforgivable.If you have been a victim of abuse, do not under any circumstances watch this film as it will cause you a great deal of pain. Anyone else reading this, understand that Fifty Shades of Grey is a horrendously misinformed mistake that should never have found its way into popular culture.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Shockingly dull!,"To be honest, I never have high expectations of movies that generate so much hype before anyone even saw them, but sure I was curious to see what this is all about. I was stupid enough to think US producers finally came to terms with sexual topics but then again, it doesn't get any more dull than that. The acting and the entire cast are into this and they are trying their best to deliver some sort of performance, but the script is so shallow and the dialog so cheesy that I wonder how many people will be brave enough to ask for their money back as in the end you are left with a feeling of being totally ripped off by Hollywood! If you want to see some real taboo sexual topics, go watch an European production, cause nothing will even come out of the US without being hand picked for the entertained minds...shame this time there isn't even a hint of entertainment!9 out of 21 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Noooooooooooo,"People seem to realize that this movie is bad. Horrible, even. But that's not the real question; no, the real question is: Is this movie worse than cancer? Well...at least with cancer you die. Everything about this movie is wrong. The acting is wrong. The script is wrong. The sex is wrong in all the wrong ways. At one point, Christian states that ""I don't make love. ""I f***. Hard."". He promptly ties her up and makes love to her. Christian, I hate to be the bringer of bad news here, but just because you tied her up does invalidate your love making. There wasn't even a point to her being tied aside from ""oooh look at our edgy, kinky sex"". But it wasn't. It was pretending to be.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Thank GOD the tampon scene wasn't in this movie.,"""""You'd kidnap me?"" ""Oh yes,"" he grins. ""Hold me against my will?"" Jeez this is hot."" - Definitely not rape, from 50 shades of grey.the 50 shades of grey movie was much less painful to experience than reading the horribly written, edited, and disturbing novel. This movie doesn't even extend into the ""Cult Classic"" category with it's nightmarish acting, horrific dialogue, and warped concept that offends the BDSM culture itself!""He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string¬Ö what! And¬Ö a gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet. Holy (bleep). Sweet mother of all¬Ö Jeez. And then he's inside me¬Ö ah!"" - True love, from 50 shades of grey.Acting: 1/10 - There's a lot of things that you can tell about a movie from the actors. During many interviews, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan express contempt for one another (if not the film itself). This followed into the movie. The acting seems almost robotic, lacking in personality.The gooey sexual content: 1/10 - Porn was never meant for mainstream theaters. This is another example on why. The book ventures into bizarre forms of paraphilia and gender abuse that readers can't seem to get enough of. While many were making their pants moist, or pitching a tent for the tampon scene, the film had to be heavily edited from the ""Fifty shades of sexual abuse"" guide, in order for it to enter into theaters.The atmosphere: 6/10 - The atmosphere along with the camera editing did indeed help make it slightly more tolerable. But what it didn't do, was keeping the men in the audience from laughing, saying ""This is just diluted porn"" to get up and walk away, or keep the women from sneaking out of the theater, hoping that nobody saw that they paid for it.Overall: 1/10 - Porn is porn, whether we want to acknowledge it or not. There are many websites of men taking advantage of women and beating them while the woman says ""More please"" if that's what you're into. Attempting to add a storyline to porn doesn't often turn out well, and this goes double when you edit said porn and put it in mainstream media. This movie holds no stable plot to satisfy those who are seeking a good story, and it's offensive to women enough to spawn boycotting campaigns, it's offensive to the BDSM culture because it depicts a practitioner as being someone who takes advantage of their partner, and ultimately, there is absolutely no saving grace for this movie other than the tampon scene not being added. This movie holds no comedic value to compensate for its horrible performance in the sense that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" does, and it holds no strong plot, storyline, or acting for it to be taken seriously.""Next time you'll be in the cargo hold, bound and gagged in a crate."" -50 shades of greyThis movie will stand strong as being one of the largest money-makers this year, but its performance score will remain below the Spongebob Movie.Don't torment yourself by watching this movie, and don't give someone who gets work inspired by twilight your money. God Speed, ladies and gentlemen.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Sick Perverted DISGUSTING,I'm sorry but i feel sorry for the people who actually made the effort and wasted nothing but their time and threw money down the sewerage for a trash like this movie. The book was horrendous to say in the least and the writer should not even be acknowledged/regarded as a professional but perhaps the writer should seriously consider getting psychological help or perhaps save everyone the trouble and get admitted in the mental hospital. HOW CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S OK TO ABUSE Each other?????????? And this is NOT a romantic movie...love is so different than this S**T. I don't want to waste my time or energy on describing how sick this is and the idiots actually had the audacity to make a movie out of it....i wonder if the writer gave the same favors as described in the books to get the movie...6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disgusting,"So obvious to the audience that it is just a brushed of version of a 'Twilight' FanFiction. Just like 'Twilight' it portrays an abusive relationship, that for some reason people are going crazy over.Why anyone would want to watch the glorification of an abusive relationship is beyond me. The film degrades BDSM by not showing an accurate portrayal of what a BDSM relationship is actually like. Christian is not a Dom. There are countless times when he ignores Ana's requests to stop, or doesn't respect her boundaries. He also stalks her, like all the time.50 Shades also degrades women. It teaches people that when a woman says ""no"", it's okay for you to carry on. As if we don't have enough trouble having people believe women in our rape culture. I really feel for women who have had to live through abuse, such as the stuff shown in 50 shades, and then see their misery and pain blasted all over the media and portrayed as ""romantic.""",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Disappointment,"As an erotica fan, I find this movie insulting.Despite the book's literary shortcomings, the plot isn't that dreadful. However, in this movie the majority of the plot was abandoned. Having taken into account that producers would have to shorten the plot, they seem to have compressed it down by only, of course, using the 'saucy' parts. This may be what viewers have gone for, but the build up towards it has been taken out almost completely, which makes it hard to follow, and instantly makes the story less important and meaningful. It removes the romance and takes away what motive E. L. James decided to write the novel on.If I could've given this title 0/10 I would've. I guess the only thing I can offer with this one star is the soundtrack. Despite Elle Goulding's awful song.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Worst movie experience ever !,"Before I begin talking about this ''movie'', let me clarify a few things- I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. I watch movies everyday. When I finished watching this ''movie'', I felt so angry. Let's begin by talking about everything that's wrong with this ''movie''.The screenplay is god awful, the story is damn awful, the characters are stupid and laughably bad, the first half is laughably bad and the second is just painful to watch, the editing is absolutely stupid, the directing is awful, the female protagonist is the weakest character I've ever seen in my life, the entire movie is so clich√© and atrocious, the sex scenes are boring and awful, the main character is called Anastasia Steele (the worst name I've ever heard), not a single frame is interesting or worth watching, you don't care for the characters even for a small second, all the characters except the protagonist and Mr. BDSM are useless and add absolutely nothing to the film, even the original song for the movie is not featured but a instead a remake, I laughed so hard when a curtain dialog happened, the ending was the best part because the credits finally showed up so I could breath for a moment, and this movie's so bad I actually refuse to call this ''movie'' by it's original name- for me right now it's called ''Fifty Shades Of Bullshit''.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,An insult to the BDSM world...,"Frankly, I'm not sure that there is a rating low enough to accurately describe Fifty Shades of Grey. Universal Pictures and Focus Features, along with producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti took E.L. James' badly written book series and made them into bad movies.The only reason that Fifty Shades of Grey gained the amount of attention and popularity that it did was because the subject matter is considered by the general public to be taboo. Taken as a whole, the books and films are a colossal insult to and a highly inaccurate of the entire BDSM community.If Christian Grey were a real person, he would be shunned by the community. The author portrays him a being mentally unstable and controlling in a completely non-consensual manner.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,What a pile of rubbish,"I only gave the film a 1 star rating, as i can't give it no stars, unfortunately. The books were infinitely better than this mediocre rubbish, which begins with a warning of ""strong sex"" If the film had been intended as a comedy- it would have failed anyway; though the crowds of girls & women who found parts hysterically funny ( for no reason I could fathom, unless large quantities of alcohol had been imbibed first) ( which might be the best foreplay to watching this movie. The ""sex"" was tame to nonexistent, the characters, for the most part, were in-believable, and the script so generic it defied belief. When I read the first book, i HAD to follow up with the second, and then third, immediately.Needless to say, the hype will only catch me once; I expect the next two films to flop dramatically, once the public know what they aren't going to get for their money.Don't waste your time or money.8 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon,"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY review by Mike SmithLiterature student Anastasia Steele's life changes forever when she meets handsome, yet tormented, billionaire Christian Grey.When I write a review I try to find at least one good thing about every movie. That being said, Fifty shades of grey had NOTHING to contribute to my cinematic love. The cast is terrible; Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have no on screen chemistry. They don't keep us interested in the film because they can't act. At one point Charlie Hunnam was attached to play the main role of Christian Gray and after wasting a hour and fifty minutes on this abortion I really think he would have brought some acting to this train wreck. The writing is crap and Christian Gray came off more like a stalker and a creeper. Anastasia Steele seems like she is slow and dumb. One thing that pisses me off about this movie is that if Christian Gray was just an average guy, not a billionaire, the tone of the movie would be completely different. The music is just dark ominous tones or crappy covers of songs.And let's not forget the sex scenes, there is nothing special about any of it. So what, you see her boobs not a big deal, but the sex parts (which is what the books are built upon) are nothing to be excited about. I should have just watched a real porno! There would have been a better story and much better acting. It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"sex scenes are lame, plot is ignorant and insulting","A baser reason one might watch this is to see the sex scenes, but even those are disappointing. The BDSM stuff that is actually shown is the kind that non-kinky folks might try just to be mix things up a bit in the bedroom. When I hear about places banning or cutting scenes, I wonder if the filmmakers encouraged this to build a rep. There are loads of better sources for bondage scenes out there, making this movie totally worthless in that department.Now it would be interesting to explore the dynamic that might result if two people fell in love where one of them is way into BDSM and the other is categorically turned off by that stuff. It would be cool to see love set against an irresolvable sexual preference in that way, and to explore the process of discovering how much trust and respect between people is really involved in BDSM stuff. Unfortunately this movie doesn't do those things.Instead, the film tries to convince us that the only reason someone might be into dominance role-playing is if he's a controlling selfish jerk who is not capable of love. The movie's only victory is a completely failure to communicate, both between the characters on screen, and between the filmmakers and their subject matter.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Waste of Time,"A complete and utter waste of time. I can see this movie landing itself a world record for worst movie of the 21st century. However, I don't exactly blame the crew behind the movie's production; how could anyone make a good movie out of a horrible book? The plot is poor, the acting is cringe-worthy, and the concepts presented are shabby at best. It seems they're putting anything into theaters these days... I wouldn't be surprised to find a movie adaptation of yesterday's newspaper. In fact, said movie adaptation would probably get better reviews than this rubbish.I recommend not seeing this movie, but instead spending your time doing something you would actually enjoy, like watching grass grow or paint dry.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

They have made 81 million on watching a rated R movie of ""you got mail"" with no plot... it was just... pathetic.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Twilight,"Was it just me or did we see another Twilight, but without vampires?! Watching Anastasia Steele was like watching Bella over and over again. And that lousy spanking, when he punishes her...and then his words: ""Welcome to my world""... OMG :)))))) what a terrible moment to BDSM community :)))))) If this is the idea of sex and attraction, if this is what women love to read or see...well, I guess people do have a lousy sex life, after all... They should all read ""Story of O"", cause that's some real s**t about BDSM and submission. About freedom and about 1000 shades of people...From what I know, this EL James and the creators of the movie know s**t about what it really looks like to live a different life5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Thomas Crown meets the Secretary.,"My wife read the books and liked them enough to drag me to this film on opening weekend. I wasn't expecting much since the reviews had been pouring out - no male frontal, in France they are letting their 10 y/o's go see this film, etc.Don't know this E.L. James author, but she isn't a Danielle Steele by any means. Sam Taylor- Johnson? She won the lottery when she married the kid from Kick Ass so I guess she doesn't care what she puts on film for people to watch.The producers should have never let E.L. have that much control over a script. Did anyone see the Secretary with James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhall? Did anyone see the remake of Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce Brosnan? It seems like those two films got merged and made into this pile of whatever it was.I've heard the novels were plenty more graphic, so if that was the case, slap an NC-17 rating on it and get some actors that can act and make the film E.L. James wrote.I think the downfall of this film started with the casting - the guy from Sons of Anarchy was the wrong choice and then he dropped out from so much negative review and then they bring in Don Johnson's daughter and the British guy.The script was shameful. I've watched porn online that has better dialog. The cinematography was horrific. I could go on about how much technical stuff, the things that actually still mean something when you make a film are terrible.Don't waste your money. I wouldn't even rent it at home to be honest. My wife had a nice Valentines Day though...Happy wife, happy life.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Avoid like the std you'll inevitably get after watching this,"This has to be plain and simple the worst film I've ever been dragged to by the mrs.Even she changed her mind about 30 minutes and wanted to leave but after witnessing two other couples returning to the screen having been refused refunds we remained and suffered the rest of the film.Quite simply, awful casting, wooden performances, secondary cast phoning in performances on the safe knowledge that hysterical middle age housewives who should know better will secure their pay days.other than the film, the worst thing about this film is the pathetic immature tittering of gaggles of certain age groups of women at the sight of a mans bare bottom on the screen. for gods sake, grow up.This has to be a shoo in for multiple razzies but simply having a successful PR campaign behind it means we will be subjected to two more installments of this utter and absolute drivel.I would rather watch Steve Buscemi have his ingrown toenails treated than suffer through any more of this 'mummy porn' and no, I'm really not kidding.If you have to waste your money and time by watching this, then expect nothing less than a boring and thoroughly unenjoyable 2+ hours.When I say a prostate exam with a iron glove would be more enjoyable, its a fact.I cant say this enough, AVOID!!!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Awful acting / poor story line / over hysterically hyped,"It seems the hype around this series of books and the hysterical blind following by women has led to them giving an awful movie 10/10 I wish I could give -10 to balance this but a 1 is the minimum.A film portraying a tycoon seducing a young women...OK if he was on the dole shed run a mile... a torture room OK weirdo I'm outa here but he's a billionaire so its different? Romance? 24/7 contract on a relationship, phone tapping, stalking, rape and violence..I fear for society if people vote this 10/10 its everything that is wrong in a relationship.People at the cinema actually laughed at the wooden acting and the corny lines ..Awful simply awful and demeaning to women who fought so hard for equality... the list of what she wont do and what he wanted to do is disgusting..After this film number 2 and 3 will have little following.. should have little following",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A film about rape and debasement,"I read the first book and hated the heroine from the get-go ... I gathered the gumption to finish the book 'till the end, thinking that maybe, just maybe it'd get better. But sweet mother of Zeus it didn't. It just went downhill from there. The main character is moronic. The writing style is vapid.The film? It didn't do any better. Is the world really out of fresh and good ideas that there is no choice but to make a movie from a book that is so irresponsibly written? On average, 1000 men die from BDSM every year and this doesn't include the women. This statistic is only in the US. Think about it, people. What's so wonderful about that? And if you still don't believe me, here are comments from people who are PRACTICING THIS LIFESTYLE... and I quote:""I am a dominant currently in a relationship with a submissive. I feel quite offended that this movie portrays our lifestyle so negatively! BDSM is supposed to please BOTH... 50 Shades of Grey is a terrible way to educate society of what BDSM is all about.""Here's another one:""I watched the movie with my girlfriend on Saturday and criticized it the whole way through. It DISGUSTED me how they portrayed us. I really wish I hadn't watched it. Society already has a negative view on BDSM and now rubbish like this is released. It's really sad.""Here's another:""It was about glamorized ABUSE and RAPE. All the other people I know in the lifestyle are APPALLED at this portrayal of BDSM. It creates a false illusion of a real lifestyle.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,it's worse than twilight,"i've been with my friends to see this movie, excepting the fact that there was crowded and i should wait like one hour to buy some nachos. i have to admit that the only two things good at this movie were the soundtracks and the pr strategy, because they were able to make the people to want to go see that movie after they saw the trailer. i've read the book as well and it was not a well written book, i mean i've read books like this before and i've seen better. so i hoped that the movie would be better, because i don't think it's to hard to change a few things and spike the things a little bit up. but i was wrong, because it all turned up to be a real disaster. i personally can't understand how a big film studio like universal would sell a movie like thins. anyway, except the fact that there was no actions or climax, the actors played awful, i think i could do it better myself, the very acting so unnatural especially Christian Grey. i also don't find it OK the fact that people over 15 can see this movie, because we all know that there are a lot of teenagers girls who don't know much what sex means or what life means, and i think that they can be very easy manipulated to do the same things like Ana and Christian did. don't get me wrong, i'm totally OK and i agree the fact that there are people who do things like this and i don't want to offend them, i just think that people should be old enough to know exactly that this is something they want to try and do.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,ewwww,"the adverts made it look amazing, they hype surrounding it made it seem amazing, that actual movie made it awfulnever have i seen such boring acting, even the line 'mr Grey will see you now' is just awful and she couldn't have sounded more bored saying it, the only truly amazing thing i saw in the whole movie was a bunch of excited 18-25 year old women walking in with huge grins and leaving in horror as they had just realised that their sexual fantasy does not stretch that far. It was cute their sex at the start but the second he put the tie on her wrists i just got weird.in conclusion i am pretty sure there are websites on the internet which have better quality bondage then this and you don't have to pay ¬£15 for it!!!5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disgusting Movie,"Nope, not because of any sex scene, I actually did not find any of the scenes erotic on it any way. Nope, not because there is BDSM on it, I actually did not find any believable BDSM on it any way. Nope, not because the movie degrades or not, women, or men, I actually did not find any hint of a real women or men on it any way.Disgusting because the poor, poor, performances.Disgusting because the lack of (even one) credible scene, plot or history.Disgusting because the massive marketing that promotes a movie that delivers nothing but an attempt to fool us all thinking we will be entertained for a while, but in practice reveals an array of careless directing, production, acting and writing, with the only purpose to take our money and run with it. Just like the book (as it seems by looking at other reviews).",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Sadly misconstrued on the subject matter - Disappointing,"Utterly horrible movie, completely misconstrued, making the whole Dominant/submissive relationship appear abusive and coming from a place of hate when it is quite the opposite.I cannot believe I anticipated this movie as much as I did, I should have read the book to see what a complete joke the entire thing is.This should have been about connection, bonding, a deeper meaning between the two, the freedom of giving yourself wholly to another, of letting go in a safe and trusted environment.Mr. Grey's wealth has no point or bearing on the subject matter, how could this even have gotten nearly the hype it did except to people who are ignorant of the subject matter, who think such a relationship is unhealthy when they couldn't possibly know what the REAL thing is even about...Sadly disappointed :(",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Awful awful awful!!,"Firstly, I can't get over how cringe worthy bad this movie was. I had very low expectations because I didn't think the books were that great but I didn't expect the movie to be so shocking! Five minutes into the movie I knew I would hate it. The icing on the cake was the scene after she interviews Christian and he says ""Anastasia"" at the elevator, it sounded so put on and fake. And I found this through the whole movie.The acting is horrible and wooden. The main actors American accent is SO bad. He can't keep the accent up so very often during the movie he slips up. The girl is slightly better but still bad. The two of them have absolutely no chemistry. None at all. The lack of chemistry is what makes so many of the scenes laughable. She looks very old for her age and she looks tired most of the movie. I found all the acting scenes put on and I couldn't take one scene seriously. I spent majority of the time laughing out loud. The only reason I didn't leave the cinema is because my friend paid for my ticket. Oh and I went to go get some extra food to get myself through the second half of the movie. The sex scenes.. well because the two leads had no chemistry and can't act, I found myself laughing and cringing again.And who the frek cast Rita Ora in this movie? Bahaha.I would rather not give this movie even a 1. But I can't score any lower. Dreadful, dreadful dreadful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Gag!!,"I read the reviews before I watched it and I thought I'd give it a chance and maybe just maybe everyone else was being really mean because it was ""mainstream"" to hate this movie. Well, I was wrong. It truly and undoubtedly is an awful film. I don't understand how it had enough funding to actually be filmed and produced. Who the hell would put their money into a film like this? It's truly the worst movie I've ever watched. Even the sex scenes (more like rape scenes) were just disgusting. I didn't find myself even remotely interested in what was going on. Hell, I feel even worse for making my husband watch it with me. it was a waste of two hours of my life that i'll never get back. Seriously, do not watch this movie. No matter how hard you want to try to like it, you will not. It is horrendous.4 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon,"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY review by Mike SmithLiterature student Anastasia Steele's life changes forever when she meets handsome, yet tormented, billionaire Christian Grey.When I write a review I try to find at least one good thing about every movie. That being said, Fifty shades of grey had NOTHING to contribute to my cinematic love. The cast is terrible; Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have no on screen chemistry. They don't keep us interested in the film because they can't act. At one point Charlie Hunnam was attached to play the main role of Christian Gray and after wasting a hour and fifty minutes on this abortion I really think he would have brought some acting to this train wreck. The writing is crap and Christian Gray came off more like a stalker and a creeper. Anastasia Steele seems like she is slow and dumb. One thing that pisses me off about this movie is that if Christian Gray was just an average guy, not a billionaire, the tone of the movie would be completely different. The music is just dark ominous tones or crappy covers of songs.And let's not forget the sex scenes, there is nothing special about any of it. So what, you see her boobs not a big deal, but the sex parts (which is what the books are built upon) are nothing to be excited about. I should have just watched a real porno! There would have been a better story and much better acting. It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon. Cheers and remember I watch the crappy movies so you don't have too.0.5 out of 10edited by Samantha LockeTwitter: FatMikeTPKFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"sex scenes are lame, plot is ignorant and insulting","A baser reason one might watch this is to see the sex scenes, but even those are disappointing. The BDSM stuff that is actually shown is the kind that non-kinky folks might try just to be mix things up a bit in the bedroom. When I hear about places banning or cutting scenes, I wonder if the filmmakers encouraged this to build a rep. There are loads of better sources for bondage scenes out there, making this movie totally worthless in that department.Now it would be interesting to explore the dynamic that might result if two people fell in love where one of them is way into BDSM and the other is categorically turned off by that stuff. It would be cool to see love set against an irresolvable sexual preference in that way, and to explore the process of discovering how much trust and respect between people is really involved in BDSM stuff. Unfortunately this movie doesn't do those things.Instead, the film tries to convince us that the only reason someone might be into dominance role-playing is if he's a controlling selfish jerk who is not capable of love. The movie's only victory is a completely failure to communicate, both between the characters on screen, and between the filmmakers and their subject matter.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,WHAT the Heck !?!,"Well, this is my first review here, as I never felt I wanted to share my thoughts about movies publicly, until this very moment... Gosh, this film was very brutal and I do not mean sex scenes. Broadly speaking, actors, dialogs and all that jazz came across rather fake and completely unnatural.. not mentioning the plot with the contract and T&C's... what? Even the sex scenes seemed not interesting, you usually get much saucy stuff in movies for 15's! SO over all folks, such a waste of time... The only, ONLY decent thing in this movie was music.. that's all and I really mean it... SO if they plan to shot a second episode, than I am moving to Moon... I am giving this film ONE star and that is only because I cannot give it a ZERO!! :)7 out of 17 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,What a pile of rubbish,"I only gave the film a 1 star rating, as i can't give it no stars, unfortunately. The books were infinitely better than this mediocre rubbish, which begins with a warning of ""strong sex"" If the film had been intended as a comedy- it would have failed anyway; though the crowds of girls & women who found parts hysterically funny ( for no reason I could fathom, unless large quantities of alcohol had been imbibed first) ( which might be the best foreplay to watching this movie. The ""sex"" was tame to nonexistent, the characters, for the most part, were in-believable, and the script so generic it defied belief. When I read the first book, i HAD to follow up with the second, and then third, immediately.Needless to say, the hype will only catch me once; I expect the next two films to flop dramatically, once the public know what they aren't going to get for their money.Don't waste your time or money.8 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Worst movie experience ever !,"Before I begin talking about this ''movie'', let me clarify a few things- I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. I watch movies everyday. When I finished watching this ''movie'', I felt so angry. Let's begin by talking about everything that's wrong with this ''movie''.The screenplay is god awful, the story is damn awful, the characters are stupid and laughably bad, the first half is laughably bad and the second is just painful to watch, the editing is absolutely stupid, the directing is awful, the female protagonist is the weakest character I've ever seen in my life, the entire movie is so clich√© and atrocious, the sex scenes are boring and awful, the main character is called Anastasia Steele (the worst name I've ever heard), not a single frame is interesting or worth watching, you don't care for the characters even for a small second, all the characters except the protagonist and Mr. BDSM are useless and add absolutely nothing to the film, even the original song for the movie is not featured but a instead a remake, I laughed so hard when a curtain dialog happened, the ending was the best part because the credits finally showed up so I could breath for a moment, and this movie's so bad I actually refuse to call this ''movie'' by it's original name- for me right now it's called ''Fifty Shades Of Bullshit''.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,An insult to the BDSM world...,"Frankly, I'm not sure that there is a rating low enough to accurately describe Fifty Shades of Grey. Universal Pictures and Focus Features, along with producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti took E.L. James' badly written book series and made them into bad movies.The only reason that Fifty Shades of Grey gained the amount of attention and popularity that it did was because the subject matter is considered by the general public to be taboo. Taken as a whole, the books and films are a colossal insult to and a highly inaccurate of the entire BDSM community.If Christian Grey were a real person, he would be shunned by the community. The author portrays him a being mentally unstable and controlling in a completely non-consensual manner.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Noooooooooooo,"People seem to realize that this movie is bad. Horrible, even. But that's not the real question; no, the real question is: Is this movie worse than cancer? Well...at least with cancer you die. Everything about this movie is wrong. The acting is wrong. The script is wrong. The sex is wrong in all the wrong ways. At one point, Christian states that ""I don't make love. ""I f***. Hard."". He promptly ties her up and makes love to her. Christian, I hate to be the bringer of bad news here, but just because you tied her up does invalidate your love making. There wasn't even a point to her being tied aside from ""oooh look at our edgy, kinky sex"". But it wasn't. It was pretending to be.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Thank GOD the tampon scene wasn't in this movie.,"""""You'd kidnap me?"" ""Oh yes,"" he grins. ""Hold me against my will?"" Jeez this is hot."" - Definitely not rape, from 50 shades of grey.the 50 shades of grey movie was much less painful to experience than reading the horribly written, edited, and disturbing novel. This movie doesn't even extend into the ""Cult Classic"" category with it's nightmarish acting, horrific dialogue, and warped concept that offends the BDSM culture itself!""He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string¬Ö what! And¬Ö a gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet. Holy (bleep). Sweet mother of all¬Ö Jeez. And then he's inside me¬Ö ah!"" - True love, from 50 shades of grey.Acting: 1/10 - There's a lot of things that you can tell about a movie from the actors. During many interviews, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan express contempt for one another (if not the film itself). This followed into the movie. The acting seems almost robotic, lacking in personality.The gooey sexual content: 1/10 - Porn was never meant for mainstream theaters. This is another example on why. The book ventures into bizarre forms of paraphilia and gender abuse that readers can't seem to get enough of. While many were making their pants moist, or pitching a tent for the tampon scene, the film had to be heavily edited from the ""Fifty shades of sexual abuse"" guide, in order for it to enter into theaters.The atmosphere: 6/10 - The atmosphere along with the camera editing did indeed help make it slightly more tolerable. But what it didn't do, was keeping the men in the audience from laughing, saying ""This is just diluted porn"" to get up and walk away, or keep the women from sneaking out of the theater, hoping that nobody saw that they paid for it.Overall: 1/10 - Porn is porn, whether we want to acknowledge it or not. There are many websites of men taking advantage of women and beating them while the woman says ""More please"" if that's what you're into. Attempting to add a storyline to porn doesn't often turn out well, and this goes double when you edit said porn and put it in mainstream media. This movie holds no stable plot to satisfy those who are seeking a good story, and it's offensive to women enough to spawn boycotting campaigns, it's offensive to the BDSM culture because it depicts a practitioner as being someone who takes advantage of their partner, and ultimately, there is absolutely no saving grace for this movie other than the tampon scene not being added. This movie holds no comedic value to compensate for its horrible performance in the sense that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" does, and it holds no strong plot, storyline, or acting for it to be taken seriously.""Next time you'll be in the cargo hold, bound and gagged in a crate."" -50 shades of greyThis movie will stand strong as being one of the largest money-makers this year, but its performance score will remain below the Spongebob Movie.Don't torment yourself by watching this movie, and don't give someone who gets work inspired by twilight your money.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Sick Perverted DISGUSTING,I'm sorry but i feel sorry for the people who actually made the effort and wasted nothing but their time and threw money down the sewerage for a trash like this movie. The book was horrendous to say in the least and the writer should not even be acknowledged/regarded as a professional but perhaps the writer should seriously consider getting psychological help or perhaps save everyone the trouble and get admitted in the mental hospital. HOW CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S OK TO ABUSE Each other?????????? And this is NOT a romantic movie...love is so different than this S**T. I don't want to waste my time or energy on describing how sick this is and the idiots actually had the audacity to make a movie out of it....i wonder if the writer gave the same favors as described in the books to get the movie...6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disgusting,"So obvious to the audience that it is just a brushed of version of a 'Twilight' FanFiction. Just like 'Twilight' it portrays an abusive relationship, that for some reason people are going crazy over.Why anyone would want to watch the glorification of an abusive relationship is beyond me. The film degrades BDSM by not showing an accurate portrayal of what a BDSM relationship is actually like. Christian is not a Dom. There are countless times when he ignores Ana's requests to stop, or doesn't respect her boundaries. He also stalks her, like all the time.50 Shades also degrades women. It teaches people that when a woman says ""no"", it's okay for you to carry on. As if we don't have enough trouble having people believe women in our rape culture. I really feel for women who have had to live through abuse, such as the stuff shown in 50 shades, and then see their misery and pain blasted all over the media and portrayed as ""romantic.""",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Disappointment,"As an erotica fan, I find this movie insulting.Despite the book's literary shortcomings, the plot isn't that dreadful. However, in this movie the majority of the plot was abandoned. Having taken into account that producers would have to shorten the plot, they seem to have compressed it down by only, of course, using the 'saucy' parts. This may be what viewers have gone for, but the build up towards it has been taken out almost completely, which makes it hard to follow, and instantly makes the story less important and meaningful. It removes the romance and takes away what motive E. L. James decided to write the novel on.If I could've given this title 0/10 I would've. I guess the only thing I can offer with this one star is the soundtrack. Despite Elle Goulding's awful song.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Shockingly dull!,"To be honest, I never have high expectations of movies that generate so much hype before anyone even saw them, but sure I was curious to see what this is all about. I was stupid enough to think US producers finally came to terms with sexual topics but then again, it doesn't get any more dull than that. The acting and the entire cast are into this and they are trying their best to deliver some sort of performance, but the script is so shallow and the dialog so cheesy that I wonder how many people will be brave enough to ask for their money back as in the end you are left with a feeling of being totally ripped off by Hollywood! If you want to see some real taboo sexual topics, go watch an European production, cause nothing will even come out of the US without being hand picked for the entertained minds...shame this time there isn't even a hint of entertainment!9 out of 21 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Nothing Happens,"I really don't get the hype. The anti-rape/BDSM-butt-hurt floating around the media hype of this movie is absolutely ridiculous.The movie floats mostly around the theme of consent. It is actually a fairly decent, albeit far-fetched, interpretation of what BDSM can be or mean to people. Did people see Rocky and say ""This is a terrible representation of what boxing is."" Probably. And they were cast aside. See The Green Mile and say ""This is not what death row is like."" Probably. And it's one of the best movies of all time.That's actually what's disappointing about this movie (and the book, too, really) is that it could have been so much more. A seemingly taboo theme gets loads of attention; but it's so incredibly awfully made that no one particularly cares.The movie comes off as a soap opera, an episode of The Bachelor, and an excruciatingly soft (read here: barely explicit) porno all in one.While folks joked that they wouldn't be able to hear the movie over the din of vibrators; the loudest thing in the auditorium was actually countless men snoring, having been dragged along by their dangerously unfulfilled wives.I'm afraid it did not receive a rose. Fifty Shades gets a big 1/10, simply because IMDb does not permit a zero. Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Book way better,"The acting is awful, there's not chemistry between Dakota and Jamie, they look like they'r trying too hard to act. There's a lot of scenes on the book that they didn't put on the movie so that's why for me the movie is kinda boring and not as sexual as it needs to be, the movie isn't THAT sexual how everyone was saying, it has sex scenes just like a lot of movies that we have seen, nothing special so i'm disappointed. I would not say that i wasted my money but i would recommend to read the book and imagine your own scene that would be so much better than the movie. And of course the movie is so overrated by the public in general7 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of romanticised domestic abuse,"Right. First thing's first, before I launch into an enraged monologue, I will attempt to review Fifty Shades of Grey as a film, as this is technically a film review. It is awful. Not so-bad-it's- good awful. Not hilarious awful. Not even a friend made me watch it and I fell asleep awful. Actually awful. I have personally never seen either of the lead actors in anything else but I've seen better acting in the amateur dramatics plays in my local village after everyone's had six too many pints at the pub before the evening performance. Not that they can be entirely blamed of course, when the film (and, I'm assuming, the book, which I never intend to read) has utterly no plot and the writing is genuinely embarrassingly bad.So yes, the film is terrible, but now to the real issue. I had heard a lot of the controversy about this film and feel strongly about some of the issues raised, but felt as though I should watch the film so that my arguments would been grounded in actual knowledge, so as not to seem hypocritical or ill-informed. So I sat down and watched it. I can honestly say I have never been so traumatised in my life. To add some context, I am a great lover of horror films, and this film was the most terrifying experience of my life. I cried on multiple occasions during the film and when it finished, I sat in a state of shock for a whole ten minutes, my body shaking uncontrollably.As someone who has been a victim of domestic abuse in the past, I tend to avoid films that depict violence, control and emotional manipulation in the context of a relationship. Films such as these are usually marketed as psychological thrillers. Not romances. The way in which Fifty Shades was marketed genuinely appals me. The fact that audiences are being told that domestic abuse is not only acceptable because 'he had a tough childhood' but also romantic and desirably is utterly disgusting. It's not only unpleasant, distasteful and misogynistic, it goes much further than that. It is violating, insulting and most of all actually traumatic for people like me. For a film to bring back old memories of abuse is bad enough. For that same film to convey that those experiences were not horrific but in fact romantic and exciting is utterly unforgivable.If you have been a victim of abuse, do not under any circumstances watch this film as it will cause you a great deal of pain. Anyone else reading this, understand that Fifty Shades of Grey is a horrendously misinformed mistake that should never have found its way into popular culture.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Domestic Violence,"The premise of the story appears to be, if you put up with the violence long enough, your man will eventually love you.Holy hell.If the location was a council estate in Bradford, it would be filmed by Mike Leigh.This is honest to goodness Daddy Complex horrorshow.The casting is astounding, astoundingly bad. Jamie Dornan stumbles through the film missing all scene stealing moments and just ends up looking like the kind of stalker that is all macho and sexy at twenty but ends up in Crown Court at the age of forty for going to far to obtain used underwear.Dull, painful and downright daft.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"How bad could it be? Well, now I know.","I thought I've seen some bad movies in my time. But this does take the cake. And the cigar. And the cherry on top. This thing (I'm reluctant to call it a movie) is so ridiculously, incredibly bad that I'm genuinely feeling sorry for myself for having wasted 2.5 hours of my precious life on this. And even the fact that my wife now appreciates the effort that I've made by watching this with her can't make me feel any better.This film fails on every level. The nonsensical script feels like something that was written by a 15 year old who'd been watching too many music videos. We all know the source wasn't great literature to start with, but the script apparently stays close enough to the novel, making it just as bad if not worse.The acting is depressingly irritating. Jamie Dornan's character is supposed to be a charismatic dominant. Instead he is a robot with a single voice tonality. Dakota Johnson is trying her best not to laugh, and I can't blame her really, but unfortunately it does nothing for her acting. And since most of the screen time is shared between those two their lack of chemistry is too obvious.The soundtrack is nauseatingly predictable. Not a single courageous choice there, nothing memorable or emotionally involving.Lastly, I think this movie completely outdid itself by making sex scenes not sexy. Arguably BDSM isn't everyone's cup of tea, but not every sex scene here is BDSM. And yet this surely was the first movie I've ever watched where I found myself falling asleep during almost every scene involving some kind of intimacy. In fact, I felt compelled to skip forward a few times because I just couldn't be bothered with watching those two make sex look unappealing.And now I know that I'll probably have to spend another 5 hours watching the second and third installments of this thing, and it's enough to make want to hit the bottle.No redeeming qualities.1/10 (way too generous)",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Pretty bad, pretty boring","Well... I saw this movie to discover what was so appealing in it that everyone was talking about it whether they've seen it or not, whether they've read the books or not. One of my friends - after she read the book - told me: I fall in love again, referring to Mr. Grey. So, yes, I was curious.Anyway, it was very disappointing. It was not about romance or even about sex - as everyone says - it's about controlling a person - Anastasia -, controlling every detail, every aspect of her life, even sex... and also telling her in many different ways that he wants to hurt her.The movie is bad. Boring, too long, no chemistry between the actors... The story is OK (so so). At least Anastasia is not as submissive as Grey wants but she tolerates a manipulative,jealous, controlling and abusive guy just because she wants him to love her... Sorry girl, that's no love.Leaving sex apart,it seems to be an apology for domestic violence with all those rewards and punishments.... and all those excuses for his behavior because he is a complex, traumatize man who has shades... No woman should tolerate a man like Mr Grey and, actually, it worries me that so many women have fallen ""in love again"", as my friend.I said before ""sex a part"" because I'm not judging neither it nor the practices the character have, that belongs to the intimacy in a couple but yet I judge the model of man that is making women crazy about in a time when so many is made to combat gender and domestic violence.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,So bad I created an account on this page to tell you.,"I've read the book, you maybe read it too. Remember how awful it was? Well... this is worse. A movie from a book written by a lonely woman who misses having sex and watches lots of porn. Remember when as a kid you stayed up just to see those shitty erotic movies from those shitty TV channels? That might give you an idea of what this is. The acting was really poor, zero chemistry, really forced faces and talking, awful accent by Jamie. Awkoward at times, really makes you want to leave. Well... maybe I went to far with that ""shitty erotic movie"" thing. This is actually worse, in those movies women are treated as... well, women. This movie shows Anastasia (Dakota) as a sex toy with long hair and beautiful eyes being abused in many ways. Some years before this would've make the director go to prison... or at least it would've made the same middle-aged women that now call this ""art"" being REALLY mad. This movie has nothing to sustain from, there's no ethical/philosophical theme brought to the table, just two people having sex, he abuses her, she tries to make him change with her ""love"". Really boring overused stuff.It doesn't get deeper than that. I really want to say something good about it, but I just can't, even the music was poor. A film that deserves to be played in those theaters that Travis Bickle (De Niro on Taxi Driver) used to go.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of I want my money back,"This movie was so shameful, and it's two hours of my life that I will never get back. The acting was abysmal at best, and I've watched porn that stirred more emotion than 50 Shades. Do not waste your money, you will hate yourself for going. If I had a time machine and could only go back in time and change one thing, I would not go to this movie. The singularly tolerable thing about this movie was the soundtrack, but even then the horrendously filmed BDSM scenes have pretty much ruined any song by Ellie Goulding or The Weeknd for me. This is a sorry excuse for anything that's supposed to be erotic, and I'm pleased to say that most of the movie theater agreed as they made no attempts to stifle their laughter and side commentary. Save your money, time, and dignity and go see the Spongebob movie instead.10 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A great movie for torturing people,"I have expected a bad movie, so my expectations were low, but i didn't imagined that I would spent two hours watching this horrible ... i don't even know how to call it. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends. The bad thing is that it will have two more sequels. There is nothing to spoil here because nothing is going on. The whole movie is poor rip off of great Secretary with James Spader.Both main characters have same facial expression throughout whole movie. The writing is 0/10. There isn't even one complex sentence. A two year old could write a better script.I would rather watch marathon of Piranha 3D than to watch even a clip of this ...Do yourself a favor and take your girlfriend for dinner instead of cinema.5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Why,"Once upon a time, a television executive discovered the ""Twilight"" books, and became such a super-fan of the poorly written drivel that she decided to take up the hobby of writing Twilight Fan Fiction.Somehow, this developed into the novel that is ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".She has admitted to being aware of the fact she is not a great writer, and that the book is her ""midlife crisis, writ large. All my fantasies in there, and that's it."" Allegedly, she was as shocked as anyone that the book's popularity escalated so quickly and that suddenly she had film studios negotiating for the rights to turn her version of Twilight into a major motion picture.The film adaptation is just as bad as one might expect given the facts I have presented you with. One gets the impression that both writers really don't have even a rudimentary understanding of what BDSM is, how it actually works, and that everything they know about it is based on every bad cop drama that's misrepresented or otherwise created an aura of terror around that subculture, things they've seen but didn't understand at an adult ""bookstore"", and maybe a glance at a Wiki article on the subject.This resulted in the perpetuation of the ignorant perception that BDSM is synonymous with psychopathy and that it's really just domestic violence dressed in leather and carrying a whip. Needless to say, this really angered people that actually do participate in such activities - especially those that consider it a lifestyle. I myself having a working knowledge of the subject and an open mind, find it irritating and obnoxious. The film has all the eroticism of an episode of ""Saved by The Bell"" and honestly that show is more arousing.Yet, inexplicably, there is a sequel in the works.My advice, if you have yet to see this film is to never watch it. It's not even so bad that it's good...it's just garbage with a big budget.If you went to see this because all of the media hype regarding how kinky and risqu√© it was supposed to be, and that part of it piqued your interest...and you were hoping to get at least a glimpse into that world, I highly recommend watching the documentaries ""Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist"", and ""Graphic Sexual Horror"".",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,2 hours of my life i'll never get back,"This review is for the blokes being made to watch it by their WAGS.I don't know what to say. I'm a bloke and i was dreading it. Not cos it's a chick flick, but because i read some reviews before i watched it. Then i read some critic reviews and they scored it quite high.So i go in trying to be positive and i felt as though the whole experience was detrimental to my life. I left confused and angry that someone got away with it. Preying on innocent females who have no idea and probably no sex life.This movie is about SPANKING??!!!OK anyway The acting is terrible. The writing is terrible and unbelievable. The sex scenes are crap and she's not that hot. I have no idea what the movie was about and as a bloke i left feeling disconnected to women, cos if you thought this movie and probably even the book is good, then you probably have a lacklustre sex-life and you're unfulfilled. This is like crap porn for sad women.My Fianc√© thought it was rubbish but if i can take anything away from this movie. It's that almost all women want a good spanking.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Atrocity,This film rarely interested me i sat in my chair restless and counted the lights in the cinema. When i did watch i felt nothing but sheer anger. To see so many women turning into giddy school girls over a lead character who is basically promoting domestic violence. Women have come far in today's society and to see them lusting after the idea of a man who is going to control them and tell them what to do like some 1920's husband and sickening. Forgetting the storyline for a second the film itself was absolute garbage. The the characters were completely one dimensional and may as well have read on screen from the script. It was in fact not even sexually arousing which i believe it was meant to be. i have never been less excited to see boobs in a movie. Such obvious product placement was laughable worse than james bond film sponsored cola. Everything was just so unrealistic. also Christian grey is clearly a psychopath. Just do not watch this movie!11 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother to advertise such a disgusting movie.Normal, intelligent grown up person won't go to watch it.I'm seriously shocked how anybody is able even to like such book or movie.

Fifty Shades of Grey,This is not a movie - this is an social experiment.,"I've decided to make my darling feel good and follow her on this projection, she was all excited, all her friends read that book - she didn't - and she wanted to see the movie. Oh boy, she was disappointed, I almost felt a sleep during projection, couldn't wait this waste of time to end. Movie about flying helicopters, gliders, driving Audi cars, pubic hair, and whipping, in forenamed order, no story, no plot, nothing. There was this gay couple on our left side, I've started chatting with them by the end of the movie, and I am usually homophobic and I never talk during a projection - this is how bad this movie was. I have realized now how you can sell rubbish if your marketing has been done right. I didn't want to write an review right after the movie, I've waited for a week to see if I would still think the same and I do. This is not a movie - this is an social experiment.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I beg you, no award please","The damage is done, the book and the movie are out there. The big fat question is: really?

So I will hold my tongue here and only say this, please do not give any award to this movie.. we have more population who are less educated and less experienced to the comprehensive ability to adapt to the recent development of human desire and happiness, please think about what they would think and start doing after watching this movie ... Our people won't be able to read the reviews here on IMDb to know that there are thousands of normal people gracefully giving their reviews on how terrible this movie had made them feel (oh how I suffered since the beginning) and if you guys give it any award, the media in China (before watching it themselves) would immediately make a big deal of it and the damage would be irreversible. oh yes, they tell would say its award winning in America!6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,One of the worst stories of all time,"Let me just say, I have read maybe half the first book, and so have not read all the trilogy. Firstly, I watched this because my wife wanted to go and not because i believed it would be a great movie, as i felt the story and the author is possibly the worst i have ever read, worst story, and writing is well just terrible. So i had little hopes for the movie, and well it didn't disappoint. Acting...woeful. Dakota really? Terrible acting, really really terrible script, but i suppose the script is no worse than the actual book. All i can say is this...if the book was written by a man, it would never have been published, let alone successful. Why women get off on the story of a wealthy successful man using his wealth and power to coerce a young innocent woman to become his slave, using her merely as a sex object just amazes me. I'm a man, and this story puts women's liberation back fifty years. Why women find it alluring that a man uses a woman as a sex object i just cannot imagine. And to make it all worse, the script and the writing quality of both the book and script is so poor, so amateurish it is actually quite embarrassing. Com on women of the world, how can you find this story anything but sexist and all those other clich√©s that women have been fighting against forever. Come on girls, WAKE UP!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Unbelievably Boring and lack of any excitement,"I have not much hope to begin with for this movie. Since it was my wife's choice to see it. I never read the novel but I have saw the trailer, so going in to the theater. I have no surprise. As I expected, I was rape multiple time mentally. By the entire cast of the movie, the director , play-write, the actors and actresses..The movie is so bad. This type of movie used to be call Porn. I don't think anyone whose in the right mind would want to see this movie. The line between violence against women and sexual pleasure from torture is just so thin. So it is so hard for the public to distinguish whether this is an outcry of a middle age women or just promotion of sexually violence against women in general. This is just a major waste of time and money. I sincerely suggest if you would like to have a good time for the Valentine days weekend. Go for something else.10 out of 21 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Emotionally Sterile Corporate Goop For The Masses! Fifty Shades of Tedium,"What nauseated me most is how we - as a culture - slobber all over rich people. The joke is on us! Sure there are some great rich people out there like Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and George Soros, but most other truly rich folks could care less if the other 99% of us dropped dead! When our heroine asks Mr. Grey which of the row of Mercedes and Bentleys are his and he says, ""all of them!"" I muttered to myself ""that's disgusting"" and I got up and walked out! I'm so glad I didn't pay a dime to see this film. Such extravagances are absolutely repulsive. We need to stop worshiping rich people! Instead we should feel sorry for them for being so mind-bogglingly selfish and banal.The acting was so unconvincing, I would call it stale and wooden. So even if you really do love all those rich people out there - and secretly want to be one of them - the movie is plain boring. All the soft porn S & M in the world will not save 50 Shades of Tedium when you could care less about any of the characters!7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

But this film is really just the romanticized version of rape. This has nothing to do with actual BDSM, it's abuse in its finest form. What this movie does is pretty much encourage rape as well as tell guys that no doesn't necessarily mean no and could really just mean yes. I just hope that no couples went to see this movie to ""try out something new"" in the bedroom. Always remember that you need CONSENT!!

Christian is very vocal in how he doesn't want a romantic relationship. He doesn't do romance or dating.The characters are horrible and annoying- Christian Grey is creepy, controlling and possessive and Anna is just whiny and irritating.The dialogue is absolutely awful and made me cringe so many times.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"This a very abusive relationship, not a BDSM one.","50 Shades of Grey is a very inaccurate portrayal of BDSM. This is not BDSM, this is abuse glorified and disguised as erotica.

They might want a BDSM relationship, which is okay, bu they might think this is a safe relationship. They could not know well enough and might get tricked into an abusive relationship.

Fifty Shades of Grey,A two hour trailer,"I have never seen such a lifeless, underwritten script make it to the screen, let alone with such a budget. A slow build up, I was expecting, but where was the suspense? This is a story about sex and yet there was no obvious reason why they would have sex. It was all mechanistic tease, no enjoyment, no orgasms. When Christian finally gets Anastasia in his Playroom he doesn't seem to enjoy himself anymore than when they did it 'vanilla' style. There could have been so much more detail here, so much more characterisation - we can assume that Gray can only orgasm in a bondage situation, but where was the evidence? Think of 'Some Like it Hot', with Tony Curtis feigning lack of interest while Marilyn Monroe lies on top of him - and that was a far sexier film. I like this director's work - her film about John Lennon was funny and poignant - but this script was almost unfilmable. The depressing thought is, and this evidence proves it, that box office failure was inconceivable, however bad the end result. Dakota Johnson does her best and brings some humour and vulnerability to the role, and manages to make the abrupt changes of mind (mostly) believable, despite minimal support from the dialogue. But Jamie Dornan is just pleasant, a nice looking boy like you might find waiting at your table in a Dublin restaurant. Totally miscast, too young, merely eye candy. (Reminded me of George Lazenby in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. But that was a movie with a *story*.) Meanwhile, if you want the eye candy then there's plenty of pics of Mr Dornan available on the web in various stages of undress. There's plenty of pics, and indeed films, where you can see people having sex and giving a damn sight better impression of enjoying it. Save your money. Please.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Awful. Just, so, horribly awful","Let's get it out of the way: 50 Shades of Grey is one of the most laughable pieces of garbage I've ever sat through. I'll admit I read the first book, so I knew the quality (or lack of quality) the screenwriter would be working with to turn this joke of a story into a film. But honestly they could have produced something decent, at the very least tried to make it artistic or potentially thought provoking. The Secretary or 9 1/2 Weeks covered similar themes, and they seem poetic compared to this. In the end it's a mess, a boring slog of a mess that drags on and on until it climaxes with a tiresome yet lackluster ending (Really? That's the worst you want to do to her? Snooze...). No spoiler here: the movie ruins itself.Let's talk about acting. For all the hoopla, I really don't see the draw of Jaimie Dornan or why he is in movies. Yeah yeah, I should watch The Fall. But really, he used to be a model? Is that why he's here? I love how much people are fawning over his workout regime, like, Wow! He did sit-ups and drank protein shakes to get a 6-pack, that's crazy. Honestly, for someone trying to be ""The epitome of male beauty,"" he looked mediocre at best. I know all the lonely house-moms who've been waiting anxiously to personify their dirty little fantasies into an actual human being are dripping wet for this guy. But seriously, never once did I find myself have any emotion toward Dornan or think, ""Now that's an attractive man."" If anything I couldn't get past his stupid mouth, how it would crumple like a wilted sprig of ivy any time he tried to make sounds come out and hide his accent. And that's the true failure of this film. It wasn't the few sex scenes or the whips or floggers that made me or the audience uncomfortable. It was EVERYTHING ELSE.Watching 50 Shades reminded me of watching a sequel that went straight to DVD. IMDb says the actors learned all their lines in 5 days. That's really not shocking. The dialog consisted mostly of, ""Hello Anastasia,"" ""Hi Christian,"" ""Did you consider the contract Anastasia,"" ""I'm still thinking about the contract Christian,"" ""How about now Anastasia? Have you considered the contract now Anastasia?"" ""Maybe in a bit Christian."" I felt like I was being forced to watch two people with no idea how to flirt or function in society try to reason through installing an Ikea bed using only their feet. ""How will we put the boards together Christian? Should we use a screwdriver?"" ""Yes, Anastasia [*furrows brow, stares blankly at the floor], we could use a screwdriver"" [*Anastasia bites her lip. Christian continues to stare blankly into the ether. Screwdriver is seen for half a second]. That actually sounds way more entertaining compared to this movie.In short, Dornan couldn't act his way out of a cardboard box (even one for that king-sized bed from Ikea), and the film pays a huge price by casting him as the lead role. That being said: bless Dakota Johnson's heart. She really gave it her all in this movie and tried to make a steak dinner out of a baloney sandwich. She's relatable, plain and pleasant and does a fine job at her job (though anyone would appear great next to that block of wood named Dornan). The lack of chemistry is palpable, or bitterly dry (I don't know which is more accurate). You can't blame the girl. I couldn't imagine lying on a bed naked while cast and crew stare over you expecting you to moan and pretend to be turned on by a man with the personality of a washing machine pesters you over and over about a contract (Seriously give it a rest dude. You sound super rapey about the contract. And quit waking her up all the time. Let the poor girl sleep). Dakota's a decent actress, and I hope she pulls the rip cord and distances herself from this franchise before she gets typecast as ""full frontal"" girl.If I took anything away from this film, it's that sadly human beings will do anything for a paycheck, and an audience will pay to see how boring it is. Mediocre has become the norm, and this film doesn't even make the grade. There's nothing good, or original, or edgy, or thought-provoking about 50 Shades. It feels dated, and designed to be fantasy porn for those too vanilla to try anything risqu√© in their own lives. Truthfully, if the main character wasn't a billionaire, or white, or attractive, this movie wouldn't be so popular. It would be a drama about horror, rape, and abuse and real issues people don't want to talk about. 50 Shades is a false portrayal of kink and a subculture that is already misunderstood. Really people just want to see two semi-attractive bodies rub up and down on each other and maybe daintily slap each other with whips (LOL, the kink in this movie is such a joke!).For a movie gaining so much press because it covers the topic of sex, I wish I could have told it I had to work early in the morning and needed to go to bed. Nothing could ever make me watch this film again or convince me to see the sequel, even if they cast me over Dornan.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Suicide,"Well, I watched it and as per expected it was atrocious. Am I surprised? No. Fifty Shades of Grey was a book that somehow managed to get published and I have no idea how. It's as if the writer was a mom and rummaged on her 14 year old daughters computer and found a sexual fan fiction about some popular YouTuber and changed the names around and edited some of the stuff, made it longer and threw it at a few publishers. It became controversial for the absurd sexual content and a specific tampon scene. The movie takes this story and gives it a massive budget, and throws it on the big screen for you.What are the good things?The first hour of this movie is so bad that its actually good and pretty entertaining, the camera-work and soundtrack are honestly not half bad and Dakota Johnson is very attractive. That's honestly everything good I can name.What are the bad things?Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst big budget movie I have ever seen in my entire life. They try and go for subtlety and foreshadow a few things in the beginning but it's done so badly that it calls for a few awkward moments. The acting is sub par at best and the way the characters communicate to each other is ridiculously unrealistic. The first hour may be so bad its good, but the second hour is extremely boring, and it's just hard to watch. This movie honestly gave me anxiety.""BUT ITS NOT MADE FOR GUYS!!!""Honestly, I watch a lot of movies and I do watch a lot of movies people would consider chick flicks and have enjoyed some of them. It's such a ridiculously stupid argument. Maybe if you're a girl who doesn't watch very many movies ever and doesn't care about writing or anything like that, then they'll probably enjoy it. Good for you. But this movie if you actually take grasp of the elements that signify whether the movie is good or bad, then this swims deep into the bad side.Fun fact: The guy who plays Mr. Grey has quit the franchise, seemingly due to his wife not being okay with it.Should you see this?If you're curious you can go ahead, the first hour of it would be fun to make fun of with friends because of how terrible it is but the second half is god awful.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Sick Mind of America,"I just read a few pages of this book ""50 shades of Grey"". I wonder is this a product of crazy author? What kind of girl is Anna? Or American girls are something like Anna: smart in works, stupid in love?When I heard about this movie. I ask What? Seriously? A movie base on this god damn book? F*ck American! So sick!This is the end of American literature! I'm totally f*cked!When I come to movie, oh my Buddha! This is a porn! Not a movie! I prefer JAV from Japan. How stupid is the girl! And the Grey, the actor is fool, ugly! I prefer Brad Cooper. He's the best for this movie! he can save this movie!30 out of 65 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty shades of disturbing!,"This is a bad snuff film. There are no redeeming qualities in this movie, the protagonist is a prick the, the girl is stupid and vulnerable. Then comes the the incredibly over-the-line sadomasochism sex scenes. Which by the way, are more like a horrible porn film. How did this even pass an ""R"" rating? I guess the main feature of the film is that she somehow ""changes him"". Which I don't really see depicted and quite frankly is nothing like the book the movie was based on. There is actually nothing I liked about the movie. I think the acting is poor, the character development is poor, the directing is poor. I feel like the creators just made ""cheap shots"" with all nudity and explicit depictions of disturbing sex scenes to compensate for their lack of talent to put together a decent movie.7 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Nothing,"Being the curious person that I am, I decided to give the movie 50 Shades of Grey a shot.One of the worst movies I've seen. How I wish I get those 2 hours back. 2 shitty actors and a shittier plot. Enlighten me on how all the females found any of this crap attractive? I didn't read the book but I'm still not convinced on why I should. I won't be watching another Sam Taylor- Johnson movie again. Boring. Boring. Boring.I was actually getting annoyed of hearing all his rules. No one likes to hear what they can and cannot do.The only thing I liked was everything Christian Grey owned. :)8 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,How About Zero Stars???,"Was it just me, or was this the worse piece of cinema we've seen in a long time? The good part is I didn't pay to see this hot mess. I attempted to read the book but finally gave up halfway through. I was hoping the movie would be a little better, but I guess not and can see why a lot of people walked out of this movie. It was God awful; the acting was so unbelievable; there was no chemistry between the characters and it was just bad acting all around. I have to say the scenery was beautiful. The plot? What plot!! It made absolutely no sense and the ending, albeit, I was so glad the movie was over, the ending was just stupid. I never thought Melanie Griffin or Don Johnson could act, now I see they passed their genes onto their daughter. I hear that a sequel is in the works?Kudos to the better known actors who declined to be in this movie.8 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Angry at having wasted an hour and a half,"I had a free ticket, and thank goodness for that because if I had paid money AND spent an hour and a half watching this horrid movie I would be even more upset and probably demanding my money back. Sadly, there's no way I can get the hour and a half I wasted watching this horrible movie back.Reading the other reviews, I'm not sure what I can add other than to say I truly was disappointed. I'm not even sure there's a story line to this movie, it's just that bad. I have read the book and also felt it was a waste of time, so poorly written.If you have money to burn and are really extra bored, I would say go for it, see what all the fuss is about. But don't go expecting anything more than a warm spot to spend an hour and a half. Maybe bring an ipod so you can at least listen to a half decent pod cast should you go with friends who want to stay the duration.21 out of 42 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Most boring film I've ever been to,"What Chinese water torture? If you really want to torture someone, make them look at this movie over and over again. They'll die of boredom. Literally.It was the first time in my life when I was checking my watch every 15 mins, praying for the ordeal to end. Too bad I knew it lasts for 2 hours.Never heard so many jokes in the movie theater before; and with all the laughs generated by those, it felt I came for a comedy.The sad part was that both characters seemed to be mentally and emotional unstable. There's no romance in there, no chemistry, just abuse. From any angle I see it.And the last straw..there were plenty of girls fascinated by the romance and giggling each time the actors kissed or had sex. Really?!Overall - I hope they never transform the other 2 parts into a movie.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Boredom!,"This is the most boring movie I've ever seen. I watch a lot of movies from many different genres, and this ranks in my top 5 as one of the worst. I went with a female friend, who said she enjoyed the movie, so I suffered this torture for her sake. I literally reached a point where I was about ready to start crying from boredom. Even the sex scenes became boring. It was like, don't they do anything else? The whole movie was pointless. We never find out why the characters are motivated to do what they do. They give us 10 minutes of sappy dialogue, then they go have weird kinky sex, which has no passion, then they talk some more, then more weirdo sex, then more talk....you get the picture. Then, abruptly, it ended. Don't waste your money on this soft core porn with horrible acting and long, drawn out, boring sex....18 out of 34 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Only a Horny Man could love this,"This was so terrible it shouldn't even be called a movie.The only people who watch this are men and boys who want to see Dakota's boobs and butt.Two women,including me,where in the whole theater and the rest were men.I guess women like the book but they don't wanna see a porno also known as Fifty Shades of Grey. Don't bother watching this.I tried to read the book once and couldn't finish it because it was terrible and degrading to any woman.Only a stupid man could love this movie. So please don't be a stupid man. Seriously,seeing Dakota naked isn't worth this very bad movie.Just watch porn instead if you're that desperate. The moral of my review is too stay away from this movie. I feel like I lost a piece of my life and I could have done much better things then watch that mess of a movie.And to the people who just wanna see porn...those scenes were bad too. What happen to Titanic,Gone With The Wind,and The Note book?? Those are great romantic movies! Not this sadistic porn addicted crap! Terrible,terrible,terrible! No woman will ever love this. (all of my lady friends hated it)...And Lady's do not be fooled!! This is not a chick flick. It's a porno. A man's movie. Well,just a bad movie anyway. I don't even think a man is stupid enough to like this.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Not worth wasting your time,"This movie is a complete disaster. It lacks any meaning whatsoever.There is no real story line. Some poor girl meets a rich guy who buys her everything. She falls in love with him but he is insane and it all goes back to his childhood. And that's it, the rest is just pure porn. At some points you start wondering if you are watching a romantic movie or some cheap porn.The actors were not very good either but who could blame them...this definitely cannot be their dream part. In addition, it is way too long to handle. I definitely wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you have some time to waste and have nothing else to do.13 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,As bad as the book,"I started reading the book and thought at first how bad the English was. But beyond the lack of vocabulary and grammar, it was just very wrong to romanticize S&M and sexual violence/humiliation. We are in the modern world where woman work and stand up for themselves. It was kind of a joke to see the innocent, insecure whimpy stupid girl like Ana. I never finished the book because it gave such a wrong message to young girls who have never experienced love. The movie itself makes it worst because of the gorgeous actors and Hollywood-version of something crappy. I could not sit through the end of the movie either. What a bad investment! I am ashamed to say I wasted money on it.14 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Utter rubbish!,"In short,this movie made me laugh and offended me, all at the same time. Any porn video on the net is far better than this abomination. The sex scenes are so tame that it leaves little point to the rest of the story.Unbelievably Bad,I can't believe I sat through this entire movie. The person who wrote scenario and made this movie hasn't even read the book. I should have stayed home, and would advise others to do the same. Acting: 1/10 Plot: 1/10 Overall: 1/10 !!! Horrible acted,non romantic,plot less.This is awful.Avoid watching this movie at all costs. Waste of money and time!14 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Loads of Crap,"OK... let's talk ""Fifty Shades of Grey""... first of all, let me start saying that I did not read the books. Well I did start reading the first one, but when I got to the ""contract"" part, I could not take it anymore. I thought that the book was really bad, poor written skills and very repetitive. So I tossed away. But I just saw the movie and what a load of CRAP. I think the movie might be even worse than the book. As a former student of cinema, I do pay attention in every single detail and I could actually direct this movie better than who did. There was no sensuality, no erotism, not chemistry between the actors, not a drop of sweat, they didn't even kiss with tongue, nobody had an orgasm, nothing, just some slaps on the butt, duh and for calling himself a ""dominant"" in a BDSM world ""Christian Grey"" was way to amateur, practically a virgin himself, there was not a believable scene in this movie, maybe when she was crying, but even then it looked more like a soap opera. Btw... Jamie Dornan disappointed me. I do prefer him as a serial killer in the British series ""The Fall"". I do blame the director for this poor movie, more than I do the actors. The movies ""Secretary"" with Maggie Gyllenhaal and ""9 1/2 Weeks"" with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger are my favorites on this genre.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,it's not worth paying to see this movie on cinema,"a poor movie, which degrades woman as sex-dolly. the movie is boring and shows just a few nice scenes. for example the scene where Ann wakes up in her guest room, and goes down the stairs when Christian was playing piano was shown two times. The movie tried to show every detail which made the movie boring and for nothing interesting. Some scenes are also to obvious and to cheap. For example the scene where Christians Mum makes all the way coming to Christian to see and speak with him and already after one minute he puts her out of home. I don't recommend to watch this movie on cinema. such a bad movie shouldn't be rewarded for his performance.22 out of 42 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,crap is better than this film,Don't waste your money on this movie it was beyond garbage it was a mixture of watching a porn and the incredible hulk pure Awful. This movie should have been bonded to a molecule and dispersed into thin air. Truthfully I want my money back And I think the movie should have left in the woods behind a steak house for the wolves to pee on it. Take this movie out of the theater a waste of time and space. The movie made me want to vomit and the acting was as stupid has a pigs butt on steroids. Please let this movie no longer exist. Exactly what the man said in the movie it was fifty shades of messed up. I am not happy with this movie at all and think it was created by an awful writer.18 out of 33 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,As expected.,"Yes, i have read the book, and i don't like it at all, but at least it has SOME purpose. Women in middle ages that aren't satisfied with their marriage, miss adventures and aren't a type of person for watching porn consider it pretty fun. Totally understandable, it doesn't really have any art value, but its purpose is FUN!But talking about the movie... that was a total failure. Seems like person who wrote scenario and made this movie hasn't even read the book, because the story actually lost that only purpose it had.Wrong selection of actors, first of all. They did awful job, Dakota is so lame in scenes that demand natural reactions, like falling down and being scared, drunk, surprised, etc., and that's the most important part of being Anastasia Steele. And Jamie is nothing but a sissy, which is exactly the opposite of how he should be. It's probably more a fault of director, but he smiles when not supposed to, talks what not supposed to, and that makes Christian Grey in the movie way too different than the one from the book. A lot of important parts from the book are missed, or just changed, the point is lost after first 10 minutes. If there were no good camera work, scenery and so, i'd say that this movie is made by high school kids.The book can be liked by women in middle ages or horny teenagers, but movie can be liked by LOW IQ-ed people that can't recognize the quality and people who masturbate to bdsm, but didn't have a chance to search youjizz, because i still think that it contains better material than this crap.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Cartoons have more depth,"It's good to see movies like this - it makes you appreciate other movies, that _try_ harder, more. Let's be frank: if there is a movie that'll win ALL golden raspberries ‚Äì this is it. It's just that bad. Cartoons have more depth than this movie - many times over.There is no life. There is no script. There is no _story_. There is no depth in the characters in this movie. At all. They might as well have rented robots ‚Äì the characters are that shallow. It's almost creepy. There are many twists and turns but we never fathom why they are. I can't fathom the choices they make.As for the scenes trying to tell the movie's story... Really... The only reason they are there is to gather a 'R' rating. It's like the old method of putting a couple of dirty words in there to get the attractive 'R' rating. The nudity, the purported ""sex"" scenes, the bondage - it's mere exhibitionism and does nothing for the story.Bland. Boring. Awful. Just awful.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Terrible beyond belief,"I cannot believe this was even allowed to made into a movie The acting, storyline, and even the name is atrocious. This movie was terrible. I read the book and had to read the entire dictionary, and encyclopedia after wards. I have friends who were fans who said they would never support this franchise again. This storyline is disturbing beyond words and so is anyone who thinks that this is even remotely okay. The only reason why this movie has made as much as it did, is because of delusional fans who can't get laid. And also people who were curious myself included to see if this piece of crap could redeem itself, and after all I could think was I regret ever watching this terrible movie.

The acting was the same. Good thing I didn't spend any $ on this movie.I am very sure I could have written a way better,hot and steamy interesting plot. Most of everything has been done before for years and years. I could come up with something people can actually feel and not want to leave their seat when it is over.These days, I do not understand why people are allowed to write crap and sell it.

Fifty Shades of Grey,First movie review EVER...just to share my opinion!,"Given that the books weren't well written, I didn't have extremely high hopes for the movie. However, I was curious to watch it anyway.I made my poor husband go see it with me and we both wanted to leave immediately, but I made him stick it out.In addition, Jamie Dornan was the absolute WRONG actor for Christian Grey. Not only was the acting terrible, there was absolutely no chemistry and in my opinion he didn't have the right ""look"" or mannerisms for the part. It was literally painful to watch. They tried to add a little humor and playfulness to the movie, to most likely hide the seriousness of the subject matter, but it was an epic fail. They should have played more on the drama aspect of it and not worried about the subject matter. If they can make movies about war and serial killers, horror films, etc., they should have at least done this movie justice by making an excellent film.The lack of depth and character development was a huge mistake.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Monotonous drivel,"Just like the title says. Really sad for a topic with so much potential. It simply encompasses kinky boss, confused ""adventurous"" girl, something that passes for some form of a relationship, barely, poor excuse for temptation in the form of BDSM. They argue, have sex, argue, have more sex, etc. If you're planning on this being something to get a little info on this type of relationship, you'll have a better and more accurate time watching something on the internet. If you're planning on getting your kicks with your partner or using this as a means to broach the subject don't. This movie might have just killed the pun ""still a better love story than Twilight"". Also on a side note, and personal agitation, the glider scene was basically stolen from (my favorite movie) The Thomas Crown Affair.19 out of 34 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

In real life, for anything alike you would be accused for rape and go into the jail for years.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Infinite Shades of Beep-Beep,"Back in 2011, after media cogently pressed me, I read Fifty Shades of Grey. Despite its extremely poor prose, I enjoyed the novel. When I finished it, I tried to not be judgmental about it. But now after watching the movie, I have to be. For lay-men and erotica-loving audience, this movie is their ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Clockwork Orange"". For ticket-not-available-for-any-other-movie unfortunate stakeholders, this might work as well. But for critics, dilettantes, and intellectual people, it's mostly a piece of beep-beep.Not just that, even the cast was pathetic. Although Dakota Johnson fills the countenance of my imagery of Anastasia Steele, she didn't do justice to her role. She was overly dramatic, artificial, and didn't fully understand her character's prerequisites. She's pretty and all, and perfectly looks like ""Anastasia"" but doesn't feel like her, except when the main couple is frolicking, but that's not acting, only sensual mingling, is it not? Throughout the movie, she tries to appear foxy and overly-sensual through her dialogues and expressions, but miserably fails. It all seemed made-up; the kind you come across with when you're watching a college-level theater play. When I hadn't seen the movie, only the trailer, I actually thought Dakota would make the best Ana, but to my bad, she was utterly disappointing. Nonetheless, she was bearable, and somewhat likable, as paradoxical as it sounds.And Jamie Dornan, or the pathetic-Christian-Grey as you'd all know him by‚ÄîI literally laughed seeing him (hiding the urge to scream or express my depression). The guy is not slightly the kind anyone predicted. He doesn't look like a magnate; he looks like a third-class, high-school, and hey-my-name-is-Swag guy. There's billionaire neither on his face nor in his gait, although I'd have to appreciate his vocal chords, but they hardly complement the other drawbacks. Halfway into the movie, he starts gaining momentum and stability in his character. By then, it's too late. The impression has already been delivered. I had two choices in mind when I heard that a movie was being made of the book‚ÄîStephen Amell and Matthew Goode. I'm happy that people actually considered these two choices. Stephen, especially, was immensely appropriate. Nobody could do it better than Stephen. His incandescence evidenced in Arrow, where he shows all signs auspicious for Christian Grey. Matthew Goode. He would have been a great choice too, given his gait, his voice, and sophistication, as per his performances up to date. But no, they were stubborn on showing their lack of professionalism throughout. I don't know where the senses and credibility of casting supervisors went that they became so lame during the casting process.I might not have been disappointed had the cast been suitable. The couple devastated the movie in a manner reminiscent of Kristen Stewart devastating ""Twilight"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", you see what I'm saying?Now comes the director. In modern film-making, direction is no longer a separate department with separate responsibilities. Director is practically in charge of everything going on with the movie. Sam-Taylor Johnson, just like her husband, is pretty mundane, and banal, the only difference being the different departments both handle. She's nothing extraordinary. I mean it's not evasive; she doesn't have that in her. Such directors can only finish the project, not gloom it. They stick with the hard-lined facts, and produce in millimeters, never thinking about the immaterial perspective of film-making. But then, how good can you direct a movie that sucks so badly at content?This might be the first time I'm criticizing Universal, which for this movie, wouldn't agree on a NC-17 rating because that would lead to a loss of potential audience. Seriously? Fifty-Shades-of-Grey-fans would have loved it. Even R is explicit enough for parents to stop their children from coming to cinemas. What difference would NC-17 have made? Let me answer this ""rhetorical"" question: it would have allowed the movie to elevate the otherwise below-ordinary script. Screenplay writer Kelly Marcel didn't really have any other option than to use explicitness of the novel in the movie, but everybody rejected it. If they had stuck to the originality of the novel (which by the way sucked too), they'd have been able to pull out something that both entertains mass audience, and gets appreciated, if only a little, by true aesthetes.I would still say that I enjoyed my time watching it. The erotica sure was catchy, and don't be judgmental, everybody gets a turn-on on something that explicit. Also, there's always something sentimental and lovable about romantic movies. The ethereal sexuality was highly complemented by the score and songs. Beyonc√©, in particular, nailed it. In fact, the main reason why the movie is ruling the media nowadays is her exquisite performance. The last trailer, for example, exhibiting Haunted, enjoyed a massive fan following, later providing an esteemed platform for the movie itself.In my opinion, screenplay writers should have had the audacity to change the theme, mold it to perfection, make it more sound and logical, and not make something that only shows a guy proving mainstream feminists true. The audience, at least the post-modernist one, does not follow a strict line. It's only looking for the line of best fit. Plus, it wasn't the adaptation of a sci-fi novel that there might have been a chance of all logic and equations gone awry.Fifty Shades of Grey made James's life a heaven; maybe she was good at luck. The book didn't deserve an applause, really. The movie? Well I'd give it something, considering the effort it takes to make a movie with this much and this kind of sex without turning it into porn.Five Shades to Grey; I think that'll suffice.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"You might as well watch porn, this was atrocious.","The title speaks for itself, you might as well watch Porn with the one you love than this piece of movie garbage. Acting was bad, chemistry wasn't there, and worst of all it was filled with horrible/clich√© scripts.I would recommend watching Porn instead, it's cheaper (hell it's basically free at this day and age PLUS the choices are limitless), chemistry is usually better between the actors, you see MUCH more of the actual sex, and best of all you don't have to sit and watch it for almost 2 hours.It kinda speaks for itself if a 50 dollar porn scene outclasses a multi-million dollar movie.16 out of 27 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fell asleep for about 30 minutes,"Awful movie after a long time. My wife read the book and wanted me to at least watch the movie.Poor girl, she was embarrassed too coming out of the theater. Routine plot, boring screenplay, repetitive adult scenes, end. ...... That's all.Started out a bit funny and interesting which was good and promising, fell pretty fast from there.Actors looked good, but acting was monotonous as there was nothing else to do in the movie.Neither of us will watch the sequel/s in the theater.21 out of 37 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Shockingly bad,"I don't have much to say about this movie apart from the fact that it's the worst film I've seen all time. The acting is awful, robotic and emotionless the whole movie just made me feel awkward all the way through it's just a weird way to portray such a successful book. I don't understand how there can be no chemistry at any point in a film like this. To me both actors had the same look and tone of voice no matter what was going on in the scene.Seemed to end in some kind of a dire cliffhanger which I'm guessing is leading to other useless adaptations of the book as a film. What I can can safely say is that won't be seeing another one of the films based around the trilogy again.My advice save your money. Bottom line I wasted 2 and a half hours I can't get back.I wish I never saw it.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,no,"I'm a girl and I hadn't read the book before I went into the movie. this was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.. the writing MUST have been done by a 13 year old. the acting was horrendous, nothing about the movie was hot or well done or worth anybody's time. I seriously thought about walking out in the first 5 minutes but stayed just to see if the movie would get any better because I know so many people love this book. but if the book is anything like the movie, then WHY?? this was like the most high budget porno ever except there really isn't that much to see the there was absolutely no chemistry between the actors. the lead male actor was just awkward and not good. do not see21 out of 36 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Very Bad,"This can be considered one of the worst movies of the century... 50 Shades of Grey is filled with bad acting and is very badly directed. Annoying and stupid, is simply an adaptation of a Fan-Fiction to cinema, from a mediocre novel by a mediocre writer. The importance of this movie (and the book) lives simply on the dirty minds of the 7 billion people that live in this planet. Well, it is not bad enough to receive 1... I gave 2 for trying. I thing that the Raspberry Awards AKA Razzie Awards have plenty of work in this one... In terms of quality I think this would be the ""Schindler's List"" (1993) of the Razzies. It is still better than ""Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas"" and ""Justin Bieber's Never Say Never"" though.37 out of 67 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,horrible film,"Terribly written book. How is this listed as drama / romance? If women see anything romantic about abusing women, flogging and spanking a woman tied up then i don't know what romance is. I posted on face book don't waste your money. I didn't realise my wife is a sheep no pun as I'm Welsh and shes condemned me and my valid opinion that the film is terrible amongst the worst I've ever seen telling me I'm jumping on the band wagon bashing the film which i hope will be a flop... Go ahead waste money and time watching it then come back and see my i told you so. They're making another two of these.

Fifty Shades of Grey,glamorising sexual and emotional abuse,"There has been a lot of fascination of the 50 shades series amongst women. I have never read the books but wanted to see what all the fuss was about. After seeing the film last night I am utterly repulsed that this film was even allowed to be shown. We have come so far giving women equal rights and there is a constant fight to allow women to be given equal opportunities however this film goes against all of this. Grey is allowed to control, manipulate whilst physically and emotionally abusing Anna. Even allowing to dictate her food and drink consumption. She even has to sign a contract allowing Grey to do anything he was wants to her and if she does not abide by these rules he is allowed to punish her by hitting her. Is this the message we want to be sending to young girls? It gives the green light to allowing someone to control, manipulate and hit you. How is that pleasurable or acceptable on any level. This film glamorises domestic abuse and should never have been allowed to be shown. Not only is the plot ridiculous it is also very low budget as the main bulk of the film is filmed in about 3/4 rooms. The acting is equally as poor. It makes me very sad that women are being 'turned on' by this film and are encouraging this behaviour. Maybe if Mr Grey wasn't a billionaire and wasn't so handsome there would not be this same attraction and acceptance.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,a stupid 'story' makes for a stupid film,"this stupid film has no storyline; it has stupid dialog; it has all the stupid excuses for cold sex, sex, sex, sex that people call it romance??? another word, it is pure plain stupid film; this is Hollywood version of porn being sugar coated as romance so that is can pull in audience; else, it wouldn't make it to the big screen. Never thought there'd be a day when porn made it into Hollywood and the sad thing is, people makes it happened. Twilight was a film about love between the couple that was slowly developed and they didn't have sex until marriage. Whereas Twilight was white, 50 shades was black; the author was inspired by Twilight and copycat it and made it into something ugly that demeans women. We should be ashamed of supporting such trash; how low our culture has gone. We have become a people of low intelligence because we can't distinguish what is good and what is bad.23 out of 39 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disgusting,"Glorifies the abuse of women, tries to disguise it as 'BDSM.' Features a 'weak, submissive' female with a powerful, disrespectful male counterpart who ignores safe words, follows her, is extremely over- protective(to the point of it being creepy), and again, hides abuse by calling it 'BDSM.' Please do not waste any money on this shitty movie, instead, donate all the money you would have spent to go see it on a donation to a women's abuse shelter. Do not see it. I repeat. Do not see it. Do not give this woman any more money. Do not aid in the glorification of women's abuse. Do not go see this shitty movie.

I decided to just go and watch he movie with higher expectations though, but after watching it, i couldn't even go through the movie for 30 minute, I started getting bored and sleepy. In my opinion, from the beginning of the movie to the end, there was lack of chemistry between both the actors.though the music was good, but the the acting was like more amateur style. the whole domination thing was beyond a joke....not kidding, as i know how BDSM works, wanted to see a little bit of strong chill than just a whipping. ...anyway.

You were based on a book that was so badly written it's hard to believe that English is the author's first language, not to mention a book that didn't contain a lick of research into actual BDSM practices. And I'm not even going to talk about how the third book in the trilogy from hell contains a scene which sexualized an unborn child - something that made me literally throw up in my mouth when I saw it. Now, the film version of the worst book ever written is officially the worst film ever made.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Mediocre novel, awful film","I've read the book and didn't like it, it wasn't horrible, but it didn't have the enough quality to justify its fame,a lot of people ""consumed"" the movie out of pure curiosity, including me. See, you can really ""despise"" the novel, but, in the end, most of you will go watch this, either because you want to know how could a movie look like based on the book or maybe because you are curious to see if everything you read ended up better in a film. It is pretty difficult to mention something that we all haven't heard before, Surely my review looks the same as every other in every other site. But it is important to mention that this movie already got several sequels and is praised by a lot of young kids that watch it everyday. A lot of schools here in Mexico display it for children aged between 5 and 10 years old. It is a movie for children, so it must be judged that way. And if you look at it from that perspective: Shrek is a good and fun movie, teaching us about the complex and emotional life of an ogre... Ohhh...

Words can not express how excited i was to see this movie. I knew going into it that the movie would, of course, be somewhat different than the book. I'm sad to say that i'm pretty sure the director did not even read the book. I fail to see how the actors got the parts they did. I don't know where these actors came from, but they had absolutely NO chemistry. The sex scenes were not sexy at all. The movie was literally so bad that I left halfway through. I now have to read the books again to get that horrible film out of my head. Although, i'm pretty sure the movie ruined the books for me as well. I'm beyond disappointed.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty reason not to watch!,"Not much to say about this movie other then it was just awful. Yes , it had some laughable humor, yes I'm OK with the sex scenes in the movie and what goes on. It's kinky fun to spice things up. Nothing wrong with that but as far as the movie goes it was horrific to watch the acting. I can't seem to understand why 100 million people got so "" 50 shades of Grey fever"". I would have to say whoever directed and cast the stars in this movie should be unemployed tomorrow. It was that bad. Waiting for something interesting to happen the entire movie. A few good spanks here and there and a lot of seductive kissing doesn't make for a movie. At times it felt like the actors and actresses where rushing through lines. it was like watching people who read three words and forget there lines and rush through the reading of a script. It was horrible. I would watch this with a free redbox rental code and nothing else to do for 2 hrs.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Like buying 50 roses for your wife...,"Let's say you did something wrong with your wife and she's really upset. Now you have to make it up to her, so she wants you to either spend a lot of money buying her a huge bunch of red roses.... or, she wants you to ""suffer"" for an evening.If you go for the first one, you'll just spend some money and your life will be back to normal within five minutes.If you choose the second option, you'll sit for two hours at the cinema watching this movie. It's the first time in my life that someone woke me up at the cinema. Now, about the move:the main actors are just wrong for the character the play. He can't play a dominant role; maybe in a gay relationship in a comedy. And her!!! Why on Earth would they pick a woman with no sex appeal at all. She's plain flat (in terms of personality). The Chemistry between these two might be the same one as between myself and the bus driver from any random route in any city around the world.the story: I haven't read the books, but if it's based on them, I'd think that the writers should have an easy enough job. So, maybe they just used Kelly Marcel's name but she actually didn't do any work? I know that she's a real professional, so I don't understand how she got herself involved with a movie with basically no story. Really, nothing happens. We could do a 10 minutes version and nothing important would stay out of it.action (that is ""sex""): well, let's say that we (men) come to see this movie with our wives/girlfriends thinking that at least we'll get to see some sex on a main theater. That'll be the case only if you're into sex with very young women, so young that you'd need to ask for an ID to make sure you don't get into any trouble. What you find is a man with lots of sexual experience and a woman with zero experience and a body that looks more like that of a 15 years old girl than a woman in her 20s.So, big NO NO NO NO.Even my wife was disappointed with the movie.Guys around the world: go and buy 50 red roses and no cinema ticket!!!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Absolutely horrendous,"So I'd read the book and realised it was terribly written and just complete rubbish. My boyfriend and I went to see the film for a laugh but it was much worse than I was expecting. The acting was horrendous. The guy who played Christian had an awful American accent. The scripting was as bad as the book. That leaves the sex scenes... Anyone who was expecting amazingly hot, crazy sex scenes will be sorely disappointed. The sex lacked any excitement. It was very boring really. I've seen sex scenes in films with a 15 age rating that are far more exciting. Basically, the whole film was a flop. I couldn't get over the amount of middle aged women giggling like young girls over Christian though.32 out of 52 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,I felt violated afterwards!,"This movie basically tries to make abuse look sexy! The characters have the emotional IQ of a three year old, especially the lead female role.I read two of the three books out of pure curiosity, but started skipping entire pages and later chapters just to get through the book. Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike and absolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man!Also, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his response should NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!!The movie and the books are creepy. Since when has it become sexy for a woman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress, what she wants to eat, where she wants to go....even her cellphone, exercise and waxing habits are under his control. She is basically just a possession.The movie is rated 16 only! Not nearly enough. I sat in the movies with giggling 16-18 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not be seen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship with common sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal. I would feel ashamed if I was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watch this movie! This is the basis that these emotionally fragile children will build their relationships on one day!

Fifty Shades of Grey,Total waste of film materials,"First of all this is just an upgrade of the awful 70's soft porn Rain Mac brigade. Why they would want to make a film with this crass material is beyond me. I suppose when so many sexually insecure people are buying the stupid not very well written book or reading it, this was bound to happen. This film is lame from start to finish, pathetic script. Why these actors got involved in this is a mystery , as it will not enhance their career one bit. It's a cheap version of 9 1/2 weeks which in itself tells you all you need to know , and all you sexually frustrated people do not waste your money on this rubbish. As I only went to see what all the fuss was about and in my mind it was worst than I expected a lot worst. Funny how people are like lemmings and jump on band wagons with all the hype.

You are watching real violence, a real young women feeling really ashamed being humiliated not simply in a private room but in front of cameramen and film crew.

Or my brother's friends that I grew up with. Also there's part of me that's like, I don't want anyone to see this movie.all the money the actors got doesn't make up for the fact that they just add to the plight of women world wide.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Have mercy on your man ladies,"I sit here with my head in my hands, as i now have to relive the two hours of my life that i wasted on watching this 'film'. I don't quite know how i can put across how bad this film is. My most accurate synopsis is that if you've ever watched a porn film, there will usually be (so I'm told ;-)) a terrible ten minute build up containing terrible acting, cheesy lines, and non believable attraction between the characters...imagine that for two hours and you have Fifty Shades of Grey in a nutshell. The whole affair just seems to fade into one long boring series of encounters, with very little substance to the story, and the supposedly 'steamy' scenes are about as arousing as a flash of your school dinner ladies drawers. The lad can act but his American accent is terrible and much like the book, the script is horrendous, he should sack his agent. the female lead is attractive but again i just don't buy that she would be attracted to the male, and if the film is based upon their fascination with each other, then it leaves you wondering why the hell you're sat there...you actually don't care if they get together.Its one of those films that just doesn't grab you from the start and it ultimately fails to pick up throughout, make no mistake, had it been at all possible, i would have left after 10 minutes, but i think my girlfriend (who also found it appalling), would maybe have scowled at wasting the money.Ill sign off with this: WOMEN: wait for the DVD, spend the admission money on a steak for your man, he will appreciate it more.MEN: At any cost, fake illness ,death,self inflicted loss of limb, get yourself out of watching this absolute dross!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 shades of another four letter word starting with 'sh',"""Lifestyles of the Rich and Perverse"" might be a more fitting title for the unusually explicit bedroom drama.This adaptation of a trilogy of novels by E.L. James -- which features a modern-day Marquis de Sade as its male protagonist -- has a pornographically narrow focus and a potentially dangerous message.James, whose real name is Erika Mitchell, has apparently captured the imaginations of bored housewives everywhere by tracing the unlikely romance between socially awkward college student Anastasia and intimidating business tycoon Christian Grey.The popularity -- and notoriety -- of James' fiction is such that moviegoers know from the outset that the stumbling block tripping these two up, as they attempt to tango, will be Christian's fondness for whips and chains. Thus the duo's first interaction -- which comes about when Ana agrees to fill in for her ailing roommate Kate, a journalism major, by interviewing Christian for the campus newspaper -- is loaded down with dramatic irony.All Ana knows is that Christian has been tapped to deliver the commencement address at her pending graduation. But we're on to this dungeon-loving Bruce Wayne's real identity. So his sly double entendres are ever so much fun.In between the zingers, Ana and Christian fall for each other. Yet, as Ana tries to bond with her aloof new beau, she's perplexed by his total lack of hearts-and-flowers romanticism. Until, that is, she discovers that he's an obsessive sadist with an elaborately equipped ""playroom"" full of pain-inducing gadgets and restraints.Though it's framed in the familiar context of a good girl's crusade to redeem a naughty boy, Ana's eventual cooperation with Christian's perversion, risks conveying the idea that all women are potentially willing victims of physical abuse and humiliation. We're also left to wonder what role Christian's helicopter and fancy penthouse pad play in rendering Ana so tractable.While responsible viewers might sympathize with Christian's troubled background, both in childhood and beyond, as well as with his passing acknowledgement of the harmful nature of his proclivities, the intent to stir audiences by teasing a supposed taboo is unmistakable.Sadly, but essentially (at the risk of repeating) this 'fantasy' promotes all the worst things (mostly violence) on the ""person"" (esp women): ie: stalk, do harm (physically n psychologically), prostitute (money), pornography upon women .. and bring down the dignity of men anyway that's my piece... the movie is -10, but the chart doesn't have that option :-)",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,No surprise,"Perhaps appropriately, given its subject matter, Fifty Shades of Grey feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one, a sensual and stylish romance about a young woman on a path of self-discovery, both in and out of the bedroom ‚Äì and the other, a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life, better suited for Cinemax's late night library than the multiplex. Unfortunately, the lesser one of the pair ends up on top, no doubt due to the creative stranglehold in which author E.L. James held director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel throughout the adaptation process, meaning that viewers get to be teased and titillated ‚Äì then totally turned off (not to mention left with a severe case of blue balls, thanks to an anti-climactic ending that calls to mind an arcade game's ""Insert More Quarters"" display). In other words, Fifty Shades of Grey is a victim of behind-the-scenes drama, neither the glossy and intriguingly tragicomic tale of dangerous sexual politics Taylor-Johnson tried to make, nor the thoroughly smutty romance James clearly felt her story worked better as. Instead, tt's the limpest, most colorless hybrid of the two possible. Any true movie lover will detest James for holding a talented director back in her own little, pathetic show of dominance, though it's possible that some fans of the book may have lusted after an adaptation that, on the contrary, existed solely to allow for visualization of the author's most salacious sentences. That's for them to report. The fans already spoke once, back in the summer of 2012, turning James' novel into the fastest-selling paperback of all time, which suggests more readers share her fixation with raw sexuality than would like to admit.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Awful,"Let me resume it. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing...The actors are really the worst pick. For a movie that lives of sexuality they went with actors that have no idea what that means.The writing is just appalling, that is no story, is just more of the same, a page out off that awful vampire franchise, and it even got the same card board actors. But little girls and horny housewife's will love it The directing, just went all over the place. The main focus was with aesthetics, no content what so ever.There are amazing love and or sex story's out there, this in not the case... now let's wait for part 2 and 3.

This was a film comparable to a nickelodeon cartoon series, or quite possibly worse. If I could rate any lower, it would be a -3 out of 10.

I saw a movie by Disney and i vomited during the first five minutes of it, and that was better than this film. >Go on a date with girl >Take her to nice restaurant >She orders a shrimp cocktail and several drinks >Ask for the check >The waiter places the check in front of me, not in front of her, not in the middle of the table >Look of horror comes across the girl's face >I reach for the check and place my credit card inside >She begins to tremble >Tears well up in her eyes >I can tell she is paralyzed by fear at the oppression she is experiencing >I chauvinistically place the check with the my credit card on the table in front of me, daring her to do something about it >The power of my oppression of this woman surges through my body as I lean back in my seat and stare directly at her >She is shaking with fright, the oppression strangling her voice away >The waiter returns to take the check away >All is lost to her now >Men at other tables begin to stand up and clap >Women all over the restaurant begin to shriek and cry >I feel my erect penis lift the tablecloth in front of me >I ask my date, ""Did you enjoy your dinner?"" >""Y-yes... thank you"", she says behind a mask of tears >I lean forward, a devious, patriarchical smile spreading across my face >And I tell her, ""It was my privilege.""",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A terrible movie that had to be made.,"Fifty shades is an awful film no doubt, but it had to be made no question, and here is why. Purely from an economic standpoint Comcast, that owns Universal had no choice. How could they say to their share holders that they passed on such a cash cow, allowing Warner, Fox or Sony to rake in the profits that this movie is guaranteed to make. The board meeting probably went something like this.""We have an option on this book 'Fifty Shades of Grey- Now this one of the worst books ever to be written, but bear with me here, because this book is selling like hotcakes to desperate housewives everywhere. It's a no brainer we have to make this movie. The great thing is that we don't even need to make a good movie, it only has to be almost as good as the book, and since the book is so bad to begin with, that means that the bar is already set very low. We just can't fail.It's not Lord of Rings, the fan base isn't looking for great quality, if they were they wouldn't have bought the book in the first place, and that means we don't need to spend much money developing the script. Neither do we need to waste money on any A list talent. Forget Tom Cruise, and Keira Knightly, just get a couple or relatively unknown actors, they don't even need to be that good as long as they can remember their lines. And we don't need to budget for a great director either. Let's face it we are not remaking Citizen Kane here, so keep Spielberg and Scorcese for another project. Heck, we don't even need to pay out for someone like Ridley Scott and he'll pretty much do anything these days. No an unknown mediocre director will do, but make sure that the director is a woman as it will help to deflect any negative PR from those folks that think fifty shades glorifies domestic abuse and the like.Now here is the best part. Here is how we can make a ton of money out of this steaming dung pile. There are two days in the year when even the most Jockiest of alpha male guys who normally only watch action movies will happily take their significant other to see a chick flick. One is on her birthday, and the other is Valentines day. Since birthdays fall every day of the year, then February 14th has to be the release date.Oh and as luck would have it, Valentines day this year falls on a Saturday, so not only will all the male schmucks who think taking their girl to see this pic will get them laid later, all the single ladies who don't want to be stuck inside on this evening will come out to see this movie in droves with their girlfriends.Seriously guys, we've been handed a gift horse. Let's green light this thing and make ourselves a huge pile of cash"".",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,About that special place in hell...,"Remember I said there was a special place in hell where they torture Hitler with Twilight and Nicolas Sparks movies? Yo dawg, we based a movie on a book based on a Twilight fan fiction so you can remember the horror of Twilight while memorizing the new horror of 50 shades of gray.While advertised as a BDSM erotic movie/book, 50 Shades is rather a rape fantasy. I am thankful the tampon sex scene was not included; that would be an extra nail in the movie's coffin.But I guess the bad writing is not so visible in the movie form; and the average sexually dissatisfied overweight housewife might still enjoy it.204 out of 319 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 shades of the best marketing ever,"I've never read the book and the marketing around the movie was so good that I had to see it. But the movie is so bad, it is not worth it. The actors are really terrible and the dialogues couldn't even exist in real life. You'll be siting for two hours to watch nothing happening in the movie besides 2 minutes of sex scenes. I can say that I laughed the whole time because it was ridiculous. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack which really matches the whole thing on the screen.50 Shades of Grey is one of the worst movies I've seen and if your girlfriend asks you to take her to watch it, she doesn't love you.130 out of 195 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Really really bad,"One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother to advertise such a disgusting movie. I consider myself fairly sophisticated, however this is not entertainment .This is not a sign of being in with the times. This is not art or a venue for good acting. This is pure filth, violence and an offense to women. This movie and I use the term loosely is worse than porn ,as it advertises itself as a main stream movie. At least with porn you know what your getting. This is the worst I've seen, because former sex torture movies, remained with the horror genre ,where they belonged. Disgusted is how I felt about this movie, and ashamed at the hype given it.189 out of 286 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Not worth the time,"This movie, and indeed the book, is NOT about BDSM. I'm 25 and have been involved with BDSM since I was 16, and this movie is about nothing but abuse, non-consent, and even has a scene that is nothing but rape.Grey don't listen to his 'sub', ignores her feeling of safety, there is NO AFTERCARE whatsoever in the entire story, not even once in the book, which would make a REAL submissive have a mental breakdown after being treated the way this girl was.Ladies, you've got mental issues if you think this movie is about BDSM. This guy is the exact thing you want to avoid if you don't want to end up in an abusive relationship. A real dominant, a real top, would never behave in the manners of this so called 'man', and a real sub would never accept this kind of treatment. This is abuse. This is non-consent. This is manipulative and even have a rape scene. Google BDSM for ten minutes and you'll see that I'm right.That is all people - this movie is a pile of trash, the book is even worse trash.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Keeping it short,"Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. I hoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative than predictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story without enough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from my aunt's large collection of ""literature."" She warned me not to expect much and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man.519 out of 754 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,This used to be call porn.,"Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing a serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to .. Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent. Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read the book.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think i missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man had written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyond understanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women I know are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused by a perverted man.1,288 out of 1,806 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,100 Shades of Terrible.,"I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.This film is about two people who have no chemistry ""falling"" for each other. ""Falling"" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter.50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Flippity-flop.,"You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book was unquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so what the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and clich√©, a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home (but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book. Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty Reasons to STAY AWAY.883 out of 1,204 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Oh this film was just DREADFUL!,"Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago.We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add)...We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said ""Do you think there's any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?"" -- and thank God she replied, ""Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can't stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It's just terrible"".We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked!I give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoor scenery!Don't waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it's worst.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,My god.. this was awful,"I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this so-called ""film"".Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at. At least convince us you're an intense guy, Mr. Grey.Plot: 1/10. that wasn't a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot for soft-core porn.. which had as terrible acting in it as real porn.Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is.. great camera work i guess and good sceneryRomance; 2/10. I've seen the notebook... that's romance. This is a poor attempt to romance. It tries to tell you they're madly in love, but it's just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama.""The deeds"" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower points than this.Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t.on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of the best action movies i've seen in a while!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Yeah, I'm sorry, it is that bad","""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,This movie raped my Intelligence,"This movie is atrocious beyond words, and the first movie from which I've ever walked out (an hour and 17 minutes into it). The session was full of giggling middle-aged women, wetting themselves with anticipation - I cannot believe this book and movie has appeal. Are women really so bored, so desperate, that this is what gets them off?? The acting was appalling - I guess that's the end of Ms Johnson & Mr Dornan's careers. And I wouldn't be surprised if the actors who refused the role of Christian Grey are secretly relieved they had the sense to reject it! The script was laughable. No chemistry between the two leads. As for the 'eroticism'.....it was completely lacking. Stilted, awkward, poor cinematography, cheesy scripting. Just terrible.Do not waste your time or money with this.2,433 out of 3,122 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,a reason to watch this movie,"This is a typical Cinderella story with some erotic moments, of course, and it must be popular for them only.Ii don't see any other reason.The idea itself is not really bad had it been a romantic comedy. But, what do you have here? I thought that as it is one of the most popular movies we might have a broken relationship case like in Hemingway's stories. so, I waited for some deep portrayal of the characters. What did I get? A woman who was just looking at the man who was buying her the expensive gifts and the man who had some issues with himself.It just reminds me of the writing that someone started without the real support. Vocabulary is poor, meaning is unclear, and everything seems so unfinished. the movie itself has some really weak points. I mean, your phone is on vibration, and he's calling you, and you don't here it? come on! and you don't check the phone later. really? and there is this other couple who is really off topic here. it's like they used lots of characters from different stories and put it here.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Another hilariously bad LMN movie,"Fifty Shades of Grey is literally based off of the awful and vomit- inducing TWILIGHT FRANCHISE. The author wrote a fan-fiction of Edward and Bella but it was denied for being too graphic, so she decided to change a few things and publish it as a book. Honestly, I want her to do more. I want her to make her own version of a lot of movies because they can work as the funniest and most idiotic versions. When I first watched this movie, I was convinced this was the worst movie of 2015. However, I now watch it as a comedy and it's the funniest thing you'll watch. The entire film tries to set up that these two are a couple but it's so forced and ridiculous that you can't help but just laugh at it. The characters are even more bland versions of Edward and Bella. It's a stupid and bad movie but if you watch it as a comedy, you'll definitely enjoy it more than you think.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Gawd awful!!!,"I believe that this film(?)was written by a radical liberal feminist, produced by radical liberal feminists, directed by a radical liberal feminist and enjoyed by radical liberal feminist. About as painful as watching an old black and white Gene Autry western from the 1930s. Poorly casted, poorly directed, poorly acted all with a terrible soundtrack. I'm a movie fanatic and will watch just about anything and, granted, I've seen worst movies but this is right up there with some that I've seen in the past five years. I find myself seeking out more and more foreign films (except for the French and the Italians) and am getting much more enjoyment from many of them as opposed to the left-wing clap-trap that Hollywood is turning out these days.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Shouldn't Have Been Turned Into a Movie,"First off, I have read the books and when I initially found out that they were going to be made into movies, my first thought was ""how?!?!"". The first book was predominately (I would say 80%) graphically described S&M scenes and honestly contained very little plot, which is why I was surprised they didn't just combine books 1 & 2 together (the second book actually has a plot).Outside of trying to turn water into wine (create a plot from nothing that is) my biggest issue was Jamie Dornan's acting. Although he has a beautiful face, if you have read the books, he was NOTHING like the character Christian Grey. I felt like the strength and demanding attention that was portrayed in the books just wasn't there. Jamie Dornan's portrayal seemed more like a whiny, annoying, persistent person who Anastasia (played by Dakota Johnson who I thought actually did a decent job) basically gave into because she was tired of being harassed.I don't know if the first movie completely ruined it for me but if I DO decide to see the second one, I just hope the actors step it up a notch.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Now that was terrible..,"with Fifty Shades of Grey,you better save your money,time and popcorn.this movie is anything but good,full of flaws,terrible acting and directing,you will clearly notice the lack of emotions,the lack of chemistry between the main characters,coldness overloaded between them. the plot was real boring and weak,the scenes were lifeless and of course the soundtrack which was a disaster,actually you can notice easily that the music was louder than the character's voices,with a huge awkward and silent gap here and there between them. in the books,Christian Grey was supposed to be a charismatic intense and controlling man,well i haven't seen any of these with Jamie dornan,instead it was pure coldness,i had the feeling like Jamie was afraid of something,he didn't enjoy it,and if he really didn't why did he even bother get the role! Dakota Johnson was no better either,but you can tell she did maybe like a little bit the character of Anastasia steel,but still real bad acting. in a brief conclusion,this movie is a trash,especially for those who read the books just like i did,don't even bother buy a ticket to watch it,save your money for a movie worth your time and energy.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,What does she see in him?,"I actually wanted to like this movie, but the combination of a terrible script and a terrible lead actor doomed me to never be able to get past the obvious question: Why would an attractive, smart, charming young woman like this want to have anything to do with such an immature, insecure a-hole? I've got nothing against the specific sexual practices--hey, whatever gets you through the night--but the wooden (!) male character's insistence on being in control every second was profoundly off-putting and decidedly un-erotic. I did like the character portrayed by Dakota Johnson. I hope Johnson (as an actress) outlives this series and goes on to have respectable career. I'll give the movie 2 stars because the music was pretty good.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,So much for a disappointment...,"I saw this movie on Netflix a couple days ago, and it was like a 90-92% match in accordance with my viewing habits, so I figured I'd watch it to see how it turns out. For one, Ana falls in somewhat of a relationship with Christian Grey, who is a multi-millionaire who gives Ana more that what she ever wanted, such as first-edition print books, a new car, and even a nice-shiny-new laptop. Later, they have sex, like every single weekend, but Ana doesn't agree with how Grey treats her and other women, and they break up, ending the movie at a very low note and a cliffhanger.For a pure-drama film, I'd say it would probably put me up to 4 stars. But as a romance film, this is such a total disappointment. If you're looking for something better than this total piece of junk, then I would suggest watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Coming Home For Christmas. Or better yet, just read a romance novel instead. There is now a lot more romance novels than movies that what there used to be. And every adaption of the book to be turned into a movie turns out to become a huge failure.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fails to arouse,"Waiting eagerly in anticipation for what was hyped up to be the must-see Valentine's film-it became apparent within around 15 minutes that this film would be an immediate failure. The books lack any real plot; trying to sustain a film for 90 minutes without a storyline is undeniably a hard task and one that even Jamie Dornan couldn't master. Dakota Johnson tries to be seductive, yet her lip biting was more reminiscent of a nervous twitch and her monotonous voice dragged-like the film. Jamie And Dakota lacked any chemistry thus making the sex scenes tedious and awkward. E.L James' lacklustre writing skills have truly been exposed through this dire film, save yourself the money and buy a curry if you're after some real spice!1 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Nothing like the way the book reads !!,""" May contain spoilers"" OK let me just say that if you have read the book or even if you haven't and have only heard about it, everybody interprets the book in their own way. For me the book was about how one mans need for dominance grew to need and love Ana anyway possible. The book obviously could add in a lot more detail than the film could ever do however when you watch the film the story is hard to follow all those little details needed to be added in someway for example his need for dominance was never truly shown his need to control everything was weak his resistance to her was not defined enough and her need to understand him was there but not properly shown to annoy him the way its portrayed in the book. The sex scenes I'm not so fussed by it would of been better if they could of shown more of the dominant and submissive side because it was more like what every husband does too his wife at least once in their marriage not like what the book makes you feel he needs and wants but the story never showed his need to control every situation even in the bedroom.The book made you need to understand him, made you need to help him, made you want to let him do what he wants to do to you but the film lacked the direction it needed to get there. The actors were good for what they were given a few of the scenes needed more grrr and the role of her friends needed more input to make you understand that its not normal their relationship to other people, The parents house scene was excellent in the book and needed a lot more for the film so that you can understand his needs.i would say overall i will still watch any sequels that come out but it should not follow the rest books as i feel it will not be able to completely show the true nature of what the story shows for me.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I don't know, I don't know...","Simply: I almost fell asleep. Was I expecting something that will have me reaching for ice buckets? No, not really. Was I looking for more SM pornography? Of course not, there are sites that I can find that all over the web. Then what was I looking for? Well, something... This story is in many ways the same as twilight; not so hot girl finds hot boyfriend and falls head over heals etc etc... In a fewer words a complete denial of decades of efforts of feminism thrown in the garbage. All a woman is looking in life is a rich hunk to protect her and dominate her? I am sorry, are we still in 2015 or in the middle ages? Boring script, vanilla dialogs and acting, and a story getting nowhere really. Even the ""kinky"" sex scenes were boring as hell. I would lose any hope but I still find that guy good in Fall, so I will just blame this movie. I don't think this is a film a modern woman want to see but whatever.1 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Why!,"This one goes out to all the negative whiners out there who saw the film - marketing on Fifty Shades was brilliant and that's why Hollywood is laughing all the way to the bank at its $85 mill opener. Yes, at your expense! It has made it's $40 mill back and then some.It's a thin line between love and hate or whether fans/non fans consent to Fifty Shades. This is the perfect film that everyone wants to beat up. Let's talk about it at the water cooler at work or give up our two cents worth of analogies on the Net, Facebook, Twitter or wherever. Hollywood executives dream.I can see them all around the boardroom table feverishly pitching this film.""So we got this Fifty Shades film- """"How many copies did the books sell?""""Hundred million or so, but...""""We'll release it Valentine's Day!""""The thing is it's not exactly a romance...more along the lines of S&M...""""What did I tell you about romance...now get me the crop!""For those of you that didn't favour the books, yet still went to see this film with eyes wide open...too bad, so sad you got duped out of your pocket money. Nobody forced or subjected you to go see it -there's the door, use it, and don't let it hit your butt on the way out!Reviewers have been rather sadistic about the movie, saying it doesn't accurately represent kink or the occasional detour into S&M. Or dating. Or journalism. Or billionaires. Or chemistry. Or romance. Or love. Or the way human beings speak. In other words, it's just like every other Hollywood film.As for the sex part - it doesn't happen until 40 minutes into the movie (shout out goes to the gal that actually timed the first sex scene) and there is 11 minutes in total. Somehow, I can't get the image out of my head of a woman feverishly sitting in a theatre with a stop watch!As for the domestic violence part, I've viewed way more abuse in a litany of other films and on TV. I could give you a list, but frankly I couldn't be bothered too much work. Which makes me ponder if Ghomeshi's damage control team are paying attention, taking notes on what constitutes consensual sex. Having said that...I didn't see the rape connotations reviewers are attributing to this film, but I did witness a girl willing to experiment and test her own boundaries. It was a power struggle between two people about having control. Christian wanted to control all aspects of Anastasia's life. She was not willing to relinquish total control over to him and in that way she was holding all the cards, which made her powerful. Yes, you can walk a fine line right into abuse, but she had the option to leave at anytime or say ""No!"" She wanted to know what made him tick and didn't bank on the consequences of finding out.My personal take on this film is irrelevant, but here goes - it was slow, dull-witted, void of any cohesive storyline. It was not meant to be a romance as mentioned above. Maybe if the leads delivered their lines better, shared some mutual real passion or chemistry, were actually believable - the public wouldn't be so enraged at Fifty Shades of Box Office Bliss!But...I did want to address some of the comments on here about Johnson not wanting to have fans see her movie. She made a generic statement that was taken out of context. She was referencing her parents and how she didn't want them to see her in a sex flick, kind of like how you wouldn't want to view your parents doing it. Johnson was proud of doing Fifty Shades and knew what she signed up for and she did so willingly. She studied for the part by reading and researching BDSM. Dornan went to dungeons and actually watched dominant/submissive sessions to better prepare him for his role. They hired a BDSM to give advice on set, so it would be as realistic as possible. These are quotes taken from Johnson herself - ""I'm proud of the movie. I think she's actually stronger than he is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that.""",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Waste of time and download,I do not write reviews and NEVER commented on a movie before ... however this one asks for it :DI gotta totally agree with majority of reviews i red ... this movie is really crap ... gentle erotic rewrite of Twilight movie series ... this stuff is only for naive teenage girls ... it was hardly the effort of download and really don't understand why would people go for such movie to cinemas ... my sincere condolences to all guys who HAD TO go with their girls to movies to watch it. Well at least hope popcorn was fresh and beer was nicely chilled guys. I had to PAUSE this movie several times ... it was unbearable (breath taking and mind blowing comedy like) ... anyway this is only my point of view.Gotta say .. i enjoyed the collection of cars (thou even that i would question) and the helicopter was not bad ... ;)1 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that!","'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY': One Star (Out of Five)The blockbuster film adaptation of the best-selling book, of the same name, about a 21-year-old virgin college student, who engages in an increasingly disturbing relationship with a sadomasochist industrialist. It was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and written by Kelly Marcel. The novel was written by E.L. James and was first published as 'Twilight' fan fiction, on different fan websites. The movie stars young newcomers Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, as it's two leads. Both the book and it's film adaptation have been heavily criticized for promoting sexual abuse and violence against women (by The National Center on Sexual Exploitation and various other people and groups); although the movie is supposedly extremely toned down from the novel it's adapted from (including the elimination of a scene of questionable rape). I found the film to be very disturbing, as well as laughably bad and pretty poorly made. Critics, and a majority of viewers, have mostly found the film adaptation to be better made than the book though (even though it maintains an average rating of 4.2, out of 10, on both the rottentomatoes and IMDb websites).Johnson stars as Anastasia Steele; a 21-year-old undergraduate at Washington State University. When her roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford), becomes sick and is unable to interview a rich Seattle businessman, named Christian Grey (Dornan), for the college paper, she asks Anastasia to fill in for her. When she meets Christian, Anastasia is clumsy, awkward and very shy. He's immediately drawn to her for these reasons. Grey then proceeds to stalk her; at the hardware store where she works and then at a bar, she calls him drunk from. He takes her home to his place, when she passes out wasted. Despite all the entrepreneur's illegal, and extremely creepy, behavior towards her, Anastasia also finds herself drawn to him and the two begin a sexual relationship. Christian explains that he's a dominant and he wants Anastasia to be his submissive. When she's initially repelled by the idea, he continues to harass her into signing a legal contract; to become his sex slave.First of all the movie is really poorly written and badly acted; but I've heard the book is even worse. It's also shockingly dull and feels drastically unemotional, and very dry, for most of it's 2 hour running length. I found parts of it amusing, and I do like the way it ends, but mostly I found this film to be a complete waste of time; for anyone looking for quality entertainment at all. I also agree with the criticisms that it does promote abusive relationships and violence against women. The central relationship depicted in the movie is definitely not a healthy one, in the slightest, and the Christian Grey character is very much an abusive sexual predator. The fact that the film pretends to be some kind of a romance, as well, is really insulting (to everyone). I've always been attracted to domineering women (mostly as fantasy) but not in any way similar to this. I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbh5F6Mfw",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Crap,"This was a poorly written and unimaginative attempt at a remake of 9 1/2 Weeks that the author tried in vain to pass off as original. They didn't even bother to change the main character's name. Changing the spelling doesn't fool anyone. It was John Gray in 9 1/2 Weeks, which, by the way, was a great movie that was well cast, incorporated innovative details, and succeeded at emotionally committing its audience. Mickey Rourke did everything right to pull us in. Fifty Shades of Grey was garbage. The two stars I gave it are only for the decent soundtrack. I was able to stomach reading the first book and it was better than the movie, but that's not saying much. Dakota was a good choice to cast Anastasia, but Jamie Dornan was so unbelievable as Christian. He was boring. Just boring. All of his lines were read as if he was thinking, ""I can't believe I got this part. I'm so glad Ryan Gosling is above this fluff so I could get a shot."" If you're into flogging, go after the folks that made this waste of time and money.1 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,s**t movie,"This one was a hit among girls and every girl on the block was talking about it, so i decided to watch it just to be plain DISAPPOINTED. Seriously girls?? This is what you like? I was told that the hero was awesome and bullshit like that, but i found him to be quite BLAND for the role. I personally thought the role demanded someone more dynamic. If he wasn't rich this would have been another episode of CRIME PATROL , a popular Indian series. The sheer concept of the film screams bullshit in my face. Really average acting from antanasia (seriously, is that even a name)and guys, seriously, you are better off watching bdsm category of p**n than this sorry excuse for a movie.1 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,I Put A Spell On You,"People talk like this is the worst movie ever made, like it's some Ed Wood Plan 9 fiasco. Well, it's a very bad movie all right. But it's not that bad.Can you really hate a movie that starts with a sexy cover version of Screaming Jay Hawkins' ""I Put A Spell On You"" over the opening titles? I mean, Creedence Clearwater Revival covered that song. It's Fifties rock, and it's the real deal!(Idea for a movie: John Fogerty plays a beloved sixty-something rock legend who has a secret side as a pain-inflicting Dom! They call him the Midnight Choogler . . .)Anyway, this movie is horrible, but not because there's too much brutal violence or hardcore sex. It's just that Master Grey, the handsome boy billionaire who like to tie women up and punish them, lacks all human personality and is a totally lifeless character. Fifty Shades is not a real romance, because there is no romantic hero. There's just an empty suit.See, when you read a real romance, like OUTLANDER by Diana Gabaldon, the hero is dark and tortured for reasons that have weight and stature. He's a guy who commands respect from everyone, not just one impressionable young girl. He's a guy who has already proved himself in ways that involve real blood, sweat, and danger. If someone's going to spank a young girl, it ought to be someone who knows something about pain. A brawler with a broadsword, a warrior from a proud people, not some faceless billionaire who pushes buttons.Fifty Shades fails because this Grey guy is just not an interesting person. His sexual tastes may be interesting, or shocking, but other than that, so what? Think about Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula. Women find him fascinating for reasons that have nothing to do with his vampire nature. Like when they ask him about fixing up his new home, Carfax Abbey, and he says, ""I shall do very little repairing. It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle, in Transylvania."" Dracula is a man with a past, a real identity, real allure. Christian Grey is banal, empty, as lifeless as the models last year's fashion magazines.I keep wanting to say that Dakota Johnson was great as Anastasia. She was, but only because the script actually gives her something to work against. Oh, and I love the fact that her blonde roommate turns out to be nice and not killed at the end.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I could deal with the SM, but not with the male lead","This movie seemed preposterous to me. I mean, I've got no problem with the idea that some people are turned on by being dominant, even by inflicting pain, and I'm equally O.K. with the idea that others might be turned on by being submissive, or even (though more rarely) from receiving pain. But I can't get my head around the idea that a beautiful, sexy, smart, interesting woman like Anastasia (as portrayed by Dakota Johnson) would have any interest at all in a mindless, boring, selfish, cardboard cutout of a man like Christian. He has money. Great. That's always a plus. But is having money really enough to make up for his utter lack of any discernable personality? I don't understand what would motivate this woman to do anything she does.1 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Grey has sex...that's about it.,"I cannot believe I actually watched this. Me, who solemnly swore he wouldn't watch such rubbish, made the bold choice to watch this for the sake of his friend. That's how kind I am. I would succumb to this for friendship. Honestly though, this has less substance than a used condom. I'm not even going to summarise the ""plot"", because there was hardly any. Young girl falls in love with rich man who creates a contract for some submissive dominance relationship thing. I don't know, and I don't care. The film is shot well atleast, and has aesthetic appeal. Don't forget the hardcore foreplay and rough sex...oh wait, it's tame? Oh dear. I've seen more convincing sex (and better plot) in a 70's soft porno. The screenplay can be best described as monotonous. Example: ""I don't make love. I f*ck...hard"". Or even: ""Because I'm fifty shades of f*cked up, Anastasia"". What even was this!? Have we, the human race, actually come to this!? I can't comprehend the stupidity of this dialogue and how undramatic it was. The most excitement I had was attempting to work out the word for a 'vagina wig' which I'm sure Dakota Johnson was wearing. ""Hmmm I know it sounds like mankini? No wait, I'll FaceTime my mum, she'll know...MERKIN! It's a merkin!"". The sex, which the plot clearly revolves around, is too funny to watch. Whips, chains, rope...we got it all, and it's hilarious. Then the accompaniment of generic pop songs, oh yes it gets better. Bursting into Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" has never felt so good. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were abysmal, not their fault though to be fair. Goes to show that a screenplay is the most central and important aspect to a captivating film. And captivating this is not. However, my life is now complete. This film brought me joy. It is so atrocious that I actually loved it. Get ready for when I watch the sequel, I can't wait...",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Aside of the controversial story, this is a sorry excuse of a movie","Aside of the story being extremely controversial (it is still beyond me why this story has enjoyed so much appeal among women), my take on the movies from a pure movie making perspective is this: Although to be fair, this is an extremely complex movie to make with all those conflicted emotions and unspoken thoughts and feelings. However, the exaggerated acting, tacky scenery, and weird inconsistent sequence of events did not make it any easier to convey the story properly. I think the casting altogether was not done properly. Nor was the level of details chosen.All in all it was a really poor movie, I lost interest in the first 20 mins, and was honestly disappointed to see it through till the end.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 shades of boring,"I finally got around to seeing this after all the hype had died down and I can say it is not worth your time. The directing is bad, the acting is bad and the story line is worse.Plenty of flyby helicopter scenes of Seattle are supposed to impress on us that Mr. Grey is a billionaire and therefore able to do whatever he wants according to US mythology. Dazzled by all this cash, our heroine walks into his torture lair, complete with red leather sofa, where he casually tells her he is a ""Dominant"" that will punish her for disobeying him and reward her for pleasing him. This turns her on so much, that she decides to let him ""reward"" her on the spot. Give me a break.The movie devolves from there.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Film Review: Fifty Shades of Grey/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason.If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn't know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time.It's not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn't exist before E.L. James' novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism.I'm not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screen writing and acting skills, you can't do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film's production.Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate's (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper's article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it.Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn't meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself?The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days?Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people's lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine's Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of 'love' for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?Fifty Shades of Grey is a film void of romance, as is the chemistry between its leads. Forcing to become lovers: one a submissive and one a dominant, is clearly seen between the chemistry of Johnson and Dornan. Looking more like two people exploring the world of James' highly clich√©d and unoriginal imagination, Johnson and Dornan look strapped and tied to fake and cheap material within every frame. Hopefully, the scars and marks left from the production doesn't act as a metaphorical stain for these two talented actors for the rest of their careers by being typed casted.My biggest concern of the film is if, by forcing this popular notion of submission and dominance to young girls, charmed and enthralled by the glamorized and wholly unreal Christian Grey ever going to be taken advantage of by older, predatorily type males? What type of message does this source material and film send women who are naive, submissive, innocent and easily charmed by the erotically charged notion of rich men with high brow toys being able to get away with anything they want? Violence, language and difficult subject matters are always at the forefront of rating controversy, yet this film was easily given an R rating, when it's message is one that needs to be taken seriously and cautiously, especially for young women.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Not the best movie!!!!,"I watched this movie because everyone was talking about it. After 10 minutes, I was laughing. I definitely will agree with everyone there was no chemistry between the two actors. it is actually uncomfortable to watch. The actress does not fit and the actor even worse, he is good looking but that it. Out of curiosity I decided to read to books, to understand if it is the movie or the whole story that was bad. I finished those books in less than a week, English is not my first language but you can tell that it was poorly written and not much documented about BDSM. I give two stars for the music. I think the books and the movie got so much attention because of people talking and teenager trying to get the kick.2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Pointless Crap! 2/10,"Review: What a load of rubbish! After all the dominating talk about what he's going to do with her with his weird and wonderful toys, he ends up falling in love with her and realises that he can't live without her so what is the point of this 2 hour long movie. The storyline is extremely simple! Basically, woman meets man! Man & Woman fall for each other! Man has a weird sex appetite! They Get It On! Simple! I thought there was going to be some major twists or some extremely explicit sex scenes but it was two hours of watching two people falling in love. I can see why women might have liked the attraction to a really warped minded man and intriguing billionaire but from a man's point of view, it's boring and pointless. The acting wasn't bad because I was intrigued about the individuals background but I can't help feeling cheated. Maybe it's better on paper than it is on the big screen! Anyway, it certainly took a lot of money at the box office so there's obviously an audience for this type of movie but I really didn't get why there is so much hype surrounding it. Terrible!Round-Up: For a movie that is based around two characters falling in love, I really can't see were the $40million budget went. Jamie Doman has only really starred in TV series, except for his role in Marie Antoinette so he was a weird choice for this major blockbuster. Dakota Johnson has starred in quite a lot of movies, like 21 Jump Street, Need For Speed, The Social Network and Black Mass starring Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch so she's obviously got a lot of experience on the big screen. Personally, I haven't heard of her before so I thought that she was a newcomer. Anyway, the director, Samantha Taylor- Johnson, has only directed 2 other movies in her career which are Districted, Nowhere Boy. Maybe her lack of experience is what makes this movie so bad. Its been reported that she won't be returning to make Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed so there's a possibility that they might be much better than this rubbish.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $570million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic movies about a woman who falls in love with a billionaire who has a weird, sexual appetite. 2/10",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Warning! Read this If you liked this movie! Seriously important!,"If you liked this movie either you are a female in hunger or a man with personality disorders. I read in a newspaper that a recent study reported that the woman who find this movie to be good have serious repressed sexuality issues. On the other hand, the guys who enjoy this movie apparently had problems in early stages of sexuality development. So if you had psychological growing issues during the organization of your individualization (separating from your mother) you will, for sure, like this movie; you can even feel some kind of pleasure by watching this perverted man (with serious sado-masochism disorders). It goes deeper in the early stages of the sexual development as Freud described it. I'm referring to the anal phase. The retention and lose of the faeces. The way you deal with it, and you cope, could determine sexually fixations, such as this. To the woman who wrote this story, this is also true; but, anyway, all the movies tells a lot about the ones who wrote them. Actually it seems that the movie could act as some form of catharsis, helping the writer to externalize her deepest, repressed and not fully-understanding desires. I must tell you, also, that this sexuality behaviour is not normal. Most of the people don't engage in this type of sexuality (wich in fact consists in a behavioural deviation) as the main form of satisfying their desires. Thankfuly! So, be warned. If you are one of those, there's still hope. Find a good analyst and deal with it. The world is full of people in psychological need. Don't be ashamed to ask for help, or cry for freedom.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,......Oh dear....,"I didn't want to bother doing a review for this movie, because being honest it doesn't deserve any more of my time. Nor your's for that matter. Getting straight to the point, a lot of this movie just doesn't work. At all.Based on the inanely stupid book of the same name you have cardboard cut out sheltered chick Anastasia Steele (yeah, really) and kinky billionaire Christian Grey who partake in confusing bondage sex that actually barely appears in the movie. Yep the most anticipated movie in years because of it's graphic sexual content and Twilight mum fan base that trolls the internet doesn't feature much sex.So if there's little sex in a movie all about bondage, bdsm and all that stuff what can we rely on to carry the movie? A good story? If you've read the books you already know the answer to that question (those who haven't, it's garbage). Good and interesting characters? The main characters have less engaging chemistry than a two hour chemistry lecture presented by a professor who should have retired a hundred years ago at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. If there was a huge amount of sex going on in this movie it would be more awkward and uncomfortable as opposed to sexy. Why? Because there is zero sexual tension in this movie which culminates in it committing the worst sex movie/porno sin...inducing boredom. Severe boredom.I give this movie props for two things: one it's actually shot fairly well and does it's best to create an intimate atmosphere (unfortunately the dialogue and awkwardness undoes all that hard work) Secondly at least it's not as laughably bad as the book its based on. Two kinda positive points results in it being given a 2/10.Thanks for reading and if you found this helpful /enjoyable check out my other reviews.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"An atrocity, more kink and originality in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than this 125 minute film","You've heard from all the rest, now hear from the best movie site about this year's biggest mistake: Fifty Shades of Grey.You might be surprised by this fact, but this twenty-something female never read the 50 Shades series by E.L. James. As a member of the novel's target demographic fan base, you know the group that allegedly goes gaga for this crap, let me break it down for you folks out there.Even if you avoided hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey with a fervent effort, you probably were susceptible to some information about the film and book series. You know, assuming you don't live under a rock or are some survivalist living off the grid while you prepare for the end of the world. So a summary of the film and series is basically unnecessary. There's this meek girl named Anastasia Steele who meets a billionaire named Christian Grey. For some inexplicable reason they are captivated by one another and their lust-affair begins.Who here has watched porn? For those of you that didn't raise your hand, please skip to the next paragraph. For those of you who did, or should have because you are a liar, then read on. So you know that formula in porn, doesn't matter if its teacher-student, boss-secretary or housewife-handyman the recipe remains the same: BS dialogue to feign a reason for these two (or three) people getting it on and then bam: naked sex city! Nobody actually pays attention to what the porn stars are saying, not even the production companies, because nine times out of ten the video you are watching is free from any one of the known purveyors of this service. Same goes for this trash but rather than lasting about two or three minutes like with porn, it lasts close to forty minutes in the film.E.L. James wants you to think Christian Grey is this sexual, magnetic and mesmerizing man. You'll have to take James's word for it because there is nothing that actually serves as proof in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. There is more chemistry between Christian Grey and his suit than with Anastasia Steele. For a film whose whole foundation relies upon the main characters' inherent and undeniable attraction, this is kind of a big deal. From the initial meet-cute, which is just contrived exposition, the rest of the film unravels as the series of far-fetched events that theoretically lead to this, I guess you could call it, relationship.The character of Christian Grey is just your average billionaire playboy clich√©, you know the type, the one that has his name on a building. Jamie Dornan's portrayal is equally uninspired and would've been more effective had it been done by a robot. For anything would have been an improvement to his emotionless and stiff performance. Dakota Johnson's version of Anastasia Steele is purely physical and devoid of feeling. She hunches her shoulders, drops her head and averts her eyes, but she doesn't inhabit the personality or character. Johnson does her best impression of acting, even desperately overacting at times to compensate for her co-star's inability to emote.So the characters and plot suck, but surely a film about BDSM has to still be entertaining, right? Wrong. Fifty Shades of Grey is about as sexually adventurous and innovative as vanilla yogurt. The audience of the theater I was in was in a fit of giggles because it is so dreadful it is cringe-worthy and awkward. This isn't BDSM, this isn't even kink or fetish, this is just sex: guy on top, holding your hands up above your head sex.Friends, family, generous guests: I implore you not to waste your time or hard earned money on this garbage. There's more kink in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than a 125 minute film based on source material stretching an unimaginable 500 pages, woof. The best thing about the film is the Crazy in Love remix by Beyonce.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disappointing,"This film was being advertised and raved about all over Brisbane a couple of years ago. It piqued my interest, and I just now got the opportunity to watch it. What a letdown. The actors have little on-screen chemistry; the scenes, although somewhat erotic at times, are pretty clich√©d; the storyline is predictable and the ending is unresolved. Even the support actors did little to raise the level of acting. Much better watching for suggestive eroticism is 9 1/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger, or if you want a silly but entertaining romantic romp, select a Hugh Grant movie, which at least will involve a reasonably high level of acting.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Dull Shades of Grey,"Okay, lets make this simple. After all the hype about the books, I was curious to see what many had come to love about the series. Now i have never read the book, but this movie was just plain awful. Without spoiling any of the ""story"" let me just say this. The acting was a shameful experience. Both characters where very unlikeable. I think what to blame is that there was NO character development. Basically giving you 2 characters and throwing them into a dull plot. The 2 characters are supposed to be adults. Yet this plays out like a teeny- bopper film. What I think really killed the movie was the very very very poorly written script. Awful dialog. Very dull, uninteresting, and unoriginal. Now i am somebody that loves movies and tries to find the artistic and special parts that make all movies enjoyable. But I am sorry Fifty Shades, even with an open mind to movies and film like mine, I just couldn't find anything good about this film. Its a real shame. I had thought with the success and popularity over the novel, that the writers would put a little more effort and time into making this movie watchable, but despite all that this was a flop. If the sequels are like this, why not go straight to DVD?",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,What was the movie about?,"I had no idea what all this 50 shades of Grey phenomenon was about before watching the movie. Regrettably, after watching it, I still have no clue what it is about. From what I understand, the book has proved a hit within a majority of woman who are generally speaking not really into literature. The type of women who normally devour hello magazine, and felt a need to upgrade to fifty shades of Grey to fantasize about a similar experience with a billionaire.But in the movie, there's no room for fantasy as you are shown images and you have to go with the acting. Your mind doesn't take you further than the screen. So if you stick to it, what is left is very very little. While the girl (Anastasia) shows some decent acting skills and she might need another movie to prove her worth, the guy (Christian Grey) was mediocre at best. He doesn't make you believe about the character for a second. I doubt he'll have a successful career if he is not saved by his looks.The only thing that could have saved the movie was if they had wished to create some suspense around the character and the origins of his mentally disturbed personality. Sadly, the person who adapted the script thought this was an unimportant piece of information for the viewer, so when the girl asks to know more about Christian Grey's past, what you get is a simple: ""I can't tell you or you would hate me"". Wow!! A truly unforgettable line!Honestly, I have real doubts that culturally-aware people will have any interest in the book, and surely not one person will find this flick anymore interesting, unless they are the type to like Jersey Shore or some other rubbish Reality TV show.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Waste of time and money,"I read the 1st book when it came out (back in 2011) and since it was the first time I read something like that I found it tolerable. But this movie was horrible! Maybe it's because I'm not 21 anymore, maybe 4 years gap made me realize what a pathetic story this is or maybe the producers didn't do a good job with adaptation.Anyway, the movie made me cringe for the first half and bored out of my mind for the second half.I went last night expecting to see hot, intense and interesting male protagonist and dull, boring and annoying female lead. But I got exactly opposite. Jamie Dornan was horrible choice for C.G., he didn't portray strength and sexiness, he more looked like he was constipating and he delivered his lines without a bit of charm. Extremely bland actor. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is Dakota Johnson. She did her absolutely best with what she got, she even made Ana look not like a complete fool (which I thought would be impossible).I get why this move was such a hit (books were a huge hit, it was very well marketed etc.) but I think that people who go to see the next one should be automatically refereed to their doctor for hearing, eye and mental check.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A Glorified Porno for Repressed Young Women,"Understandably you may have been led to believe from Fifty Shades of Grey's marketing that it is edgy, racy and sexy. It is none of the above, yes you heard me correct and have been sorely mislead, but at least the marketing was highly successful.It is necessary to understand how the film came about, no pun intended. It was adapted from the poorly written book of the same name by ""author"" E. L. James, which in turn was adapted from a fan fiction of 'Twilight', all of this figures. Many of the plot points and events are parallels to the 'Twilight' saga and lines like ""I'm not the man for you"" feel directly lifted from it.But at least the film gets some things right, which is another way of saying barely anything at all. The film is well shot which is unsurprising when it is Seamus McGarvey who photographed the exquisite Avengers. However, this becomes redundant when the film you are photographing is utter trite.The music though, sounds like the things of wet dreams, yet never quite reaches the full potential of composer Danny Elfman, who is somewhat underutilized, as the majority of the film has techno pop songs thrown into the sound scape. 'Love Me Like You Do' is as expected the best element of Fifty Shades and Ellie Goulding's vocals accelerate the intimacy very well. I would rather listen to it a hundred times on a loop than watch the two or three inevitable sequels, depending on whether they split the last book in half.One more element that must be considered before I go on an endless rant is Dakota Johnson who plays Anastasia Steele sounding awfully like a female porn star. She gets the chance to interview renounced Billionaire Christian Grey and they build a rapport to say the least. Johnson really should not be here leaving a giant mess of a film making a bad impact on her limited filmography. If this is the one that she expected to launch her into the atmosphere then God help her. She does the best with what she is given bless her. Mainly biting her lip and trembling with anticipation to be punished by Mr. Grey played by Jamie Dornan who has no idea what he is doing in any scene that he is in, it begs the question; does he even know how to have sex? Dornan is just plain and simply bland and bad, he delivers his lines with the dramatic resonance of a new comer to a soap opera. Almost winking at the camera like a reality TV star from Geordie Shore. At least he has the looks because otherwise he would have nothing going for him, this level of acting I expect to find in a low budget pornographic film, not a Hollywood Blockbuster or is that Block Basher?Which unfortunately brings me to the script. I do not think there has been one this awful and misguided since 'Twilight', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth'. It is the work of four amateurs (or at least it feels that way) and it sticks out like a sore thumb. How four people mashed together this terrible script is beyond any comprehension because it stinks. I have seen better work by one person, Aaron Sorkin, he seems to be one of the few script writers that actually possesses a working brain. The lines do induce laughs, but unintentional ones. You never feel that Grey and Steele are connected emotionally; they are only together because the script is insistent that they are. I fail to see what Anastasia gets out of their sexual encounters apart from losing her cherry. Mr Grey spanks her butt and that is all there is to it. No chemistry whatsoever. Dornan is like a plank of wood, but Johnson reaches to inject her character with some well needed development and tries to make sparks fly, they are just nowhere to be seen. If this is true love, then I think I have more sexual tension with my Blu- ray Surround Sound System.It is far too long and padded to the limit; and I thought 'The Hobbit' and 'The Hunger Games Mockingjay' where stretched to the max, within an inch of their lives. We have to sit through endless talking about mundane topics, which will seem sexual to a male audience under the age of twelve and a female audience under the age of sixteen. In the UK, 'Fifty Shades of Sh*te' is an 18, so they are unable to view it. The only audience members it therefore has are forty-year-old women who have tragic sex lives and unwilling couples who are fooled into watching it because it is released on Valentine's Day.Yes, there are sex scenes and we see Johnson's boobs and butt. However, this does not mean it is worth the ticket price; I do not care how amazing they both are! Dornan simply stares at her like the male equivalent of Bella and there we have it Twilight with rough sex! Which includes BDSM, but the writers seem to have glanced at what a Wikipedia page can tell you! There is no understanding prevalent in the film and Steele seems to be uncomfortable as her bum is slapped about. Just a hint, now might be the time to use your safe word.I can go on for no longer and cannot review what is the worst excuse for a film and not only the worst film of 2015, but also the worst film ever made. 'Batman and Robin' you have been robbed of your kingly crown. Don't take your loved one to see it. You may lose them forever. Just have a romantic night in with any of the following films, 'Titanic', 'Annie Hall', 'Beauty and the Beast', '(500) Days of Summer' or 'Her'. Save yourself from this colossal cum stain of a film.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disappointment,"After watching the movie, I cannot stop being disappointed for almost every single moment throughout the entire film! It just, you know, kind of having so many confusing scenes which causes audiences misunderstand what's going on, what the film actually features about. One more point is that the film doesn't show how important the 2 main character are because they played their scenes constrainedly. I think that they should have some more scenes so that they can link together and make the audience easily get to the main aim of the director or the film maker. For the rest of the series, they should have considered more about which necessary scenes they should put on so that the audience can enjoy them positively not like with the first one.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Terrible everything,"I don't know if it is fair for me to write this review as I am only 24 minutes into the movie and forcing myself to keep watching. The acting is absolutely terrible I have my face scrunched up. To be fair to Jamie Dornan he is better than Dakota Johnson even though his accent is appalling, Dakota Johnson is awkward, irritating and talks slowly to try and give off the impression of being nervous, there is no chemistry between the two actors or characters, they are awkward and I don't see any connection. I don't really have anything else to say as by the end of writing this review I am so bored with the film it is getting turned off as I would rather do History homework. The book was bad enough but the film is abysmal.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,An A for Effort,"Extremely drab.The book has seemingly been written as a joke, and the movie looked like a lot of effort and cash has been spent in vain.The primary theme is s/m; the movie made a good effort at retaining the fine line between a commercial movie and porn. However, that somehow defeated the purpose. Did I also mention how lackluster the plot is? Not to mention, the bizarre way the plot ends. The credit goes to the author, though. Book writing is not for everyone. The next time i come across ""fan fiction"", i'll steer clear. The movie was a better effort than the book. A staggering Thumb-up to that!A waste of reading and viewing-time :-(3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Waited 2 hr for something to happen,"This movie views as awkward as the book reads. The least graphic way I can describe it is picture something a 50 year virgin old-maid who has lived with cats all her life would write, but only after being in a body cast for 2 months with no sexual release.Its just awkward, the dialect is forced and everything in the story conveniently just happens to go their way. Its not plausible in anyway and to top it off, its BORING. I kept waiting for something of a actual story line to emerge from the miasma but nothing came. Even the music seemed mono-toned when paired with the often black and white back-grounds and muddled mood lighting The only reason I gave it 2 stars is its slightly better then Freddy Got Fingered3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,avoid like the plague,"I have not read the books so i went into this as a neutral and gotta say the hype for this film left me with a question..why?? as this was the biggest load of rubbish i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films. The story is just awful the wording and quotes said in the film make you want to rip of your ears then dip your head in a bowl of vinegar, why would a talented actress like dakota johnson play the role of a woman who is a pathetic sexual play toy for a twisted rich bloke. I get some people are into things like this but why oh why would you turn it into a 2 hour film? My advice if your into this try going on your laptop and enter google but avoid this film as the only thing that was good about this was the soundtrack3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Embarrassed to admit I watched this.,"A close friend of mine enjoyed the books and really wanted to see this movie. I wasn't so thrilled since the same friend talked me into reading the first novel in the series about 8 months back and I felt it was an immature, poorly edited book. (If one can even consider Twilight fan-fic a real novel..)Needless to say I had very low expectations going into this film, and my expectations were mostly correct. There were a few nice set pieces, and a couple of moments where the filmmakers obviously tried to rise above their source material. That's the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1..Aside from a few OK scenes though, this movie is mostly awful.. There was NO chemistry between the two leads IMO. And for a movie whose subject matter is based almost entirely around S&M, there was extremely little to be found here. I did not expect the film to be a pornography, but considering the book reads like grocery store soft-core, I was surprised that the movie was so tame. It was boring really, almost painfully so.If you must watch this movie, wait til it hits DVD or on-demand, don't waste theater ticket money to watch it...",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Grey is literally Grey and really disappointing....,"I am a huge fan of the book. I love that it's different from any romance novel I know. But this movie which is an adaption to the book that I refer to is really disappointing. I think Jamie should return to acting school because the only thing that is good about him is his look and if that is the only good thing about him than he should have been a model not an actor. I love Dakota. I think she is funny and beautiful in a way that not many people see. The lack of chemistry in this movie does not go unnoticed and of course that is another disappointment from this movie. And maybe for those who have read the book, I believe you notice that the story in this movie was told way too fast. This is the main problem that I have with the movie. It's just too fast! They forgot to put many little details from the book into the movie and because of that I could not have the same connection with the movie that i have with the book. For those who haven't read the book, I suggest you not to watch this movie because you WILL be disappointed with this movie, especially if you are just curious about all the hype that is fifty shades of grey. Overall, Fifty Shades of Grey is indeed grey. It's bland and it's grey, simple as that. I just hope the next movie won't be as disappointing as this.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disappointing,"This is my first review but I had to write something about this movie. It was a very disappointing one. I left the movie half way through. Christian seemed pretending to be someone he clearly wasn't. Anna was better in her performance but soon joined Christian's league. In the beginning of the movie, I got a feeling that Anna was trying to be intimated by Christian more than Christian doing something to intimidate her at the interview. He almost seemed boyish. When Anna trips at the door to Christian's cabin, it was one of the most predictable scenes that one could see. Their discussions over the clauses in the agreement for whatever he wanted to do, was a joke. It was a very wooden performance. This subject did not seem to be a new one but even with that, they could have made a much better movie had they not tried to force a wolf's skin over a lamb.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Rubbish!,There was such a big hype for this film and yet i have just wasted ¬£9 at my local cinema watching this garbage people call a 'fanstastic film'. The acting was so unrealistic (jamie dornan is fit though). It just all seemed so awkward watching it and there was definitely not enough sex in there! So much for it being 'the raunchiest' film of the year. Got my hopes up for nothing. And that ending well it was a stupid cliffhanger how can it just end like that really? The sequel will probably take another 3 years to come out. Not a happy viewer i expected well more. The books in my opinion were so much better! I hope the next film is good3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,You don't want to see this!,"Poor, poor movie. I don't even know where to start. This is probably the 2014 movie that managed to have a great box office, and be the worst movie of 2014. Don't expect anything of this movie. All you should expect is, bad acting, bad movie editing, bad cinematography, bad everything. The storyline escalates too quickly and yet the film is boring. The dialogs are terrible and honestly if you want to see something related to this genre, just open your google browser and search for porn. There is absolutely nothing special happening in the movie. 2 stars out of 10. Don't waste your money/time cause it's definitely not worth it!3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Sex may sell but a story helps..,I don't fault the actors who had to perform to this script which was void of anything meaningful or redeeming. The only saving grace was the likability of the actress playing Anastasia. She had potential which was wasted in this movie.Sex is one thing embedded in a good story it can even add some interest. This is not.How this book was ever so widely read is beyond me. To make a movie out of this crap was really bad decision making by the studio exec who approved it.All this movie was is soft porn. Like a porn movie it had no plot or story line. Skip it and find a real story to watch.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Disappointing,"This film was being advertised and raved about all over Brisbane a couple of years ago. It piqued my interest, and I just now got the opportunity to watch it. What a letdown. The actors have little on-screen chemistry; the scenes, although somewhat erotic at times, are pretty clich√©d; the storyline is predictable and the ending is unresolved. Even the support actors did little to raise the level of acting. Much better watching for suggestive eroticism is 9 1/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger, or if you want a silly but entertaining romantic romp, select a Hugh Grant movie, which at least will involve a reasonably high level of acting.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,"An atrocity, more kink and originality in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than this 125 minute film","You've heard from all the rest, now hear from the best movie site about this year's biggest mistake: Fifty Shades of Grey.You might be surprised by this fact, but this twenty-something female never read the 50 Shades series by E.L. James. As a member of the novel's target demographic fan base, you know the group that allegedly goes gaga for this crap, let me break it down for you folks out there.Even if you avoided hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey with a fervent effort, you probably were susceptible to some information about the film and book series. You know, assuming you don't live under a rock or are some survivalist living off the grid while you prepare for the end of the world. So a summary of the film and series is basically unnecessary. There's this meek girl named Anastasia Steele who meets a billionaire named Christian Grey. For some inexplicable reason they are captivated by one another and their lust-affair begins.Who here has watched porn? For those of you that didn't raise your hand, please skip to the next paragraph. For those of you who did, or should have because you are a liar, then read on. So you know that formula in porn, doesn't matter if its teacher-student, boss-secretary or housewife-handyman the recipe remains the same: BS dialogue to feign a reason for these two (or three) people getting it on and then bam: naked sex city! Nobody actually pays attention to what the porn stars are saying, not even the production companies, because nine times out of ten the video you are watching is free from any one of the known purveyors of this service. Same goes for this trash but rather than lasting about two or three minutes like with porn, it lasts close to forty minutes in the film.E.L. James wants you to think Christian Grey is this sexual, magnetic and mesmerizing man. You'll have to take James's word for it because there is nothing that actually serves as proof in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. There is more chemistry between Christian Grey and his suit than with Anastasia Steele. For a film whose whole foundation relies upon the main characters' inherent and undeniable attraction, this is kind of a big deal. From the initial meet-cute, which is just contrived exposition, the rest of the film unravels as the series of far-fetched events that theoretically lead to this, I guess you could call it, relationship.The character of Christian Grey is just your average billionaire playboy clich√©, you know the type, the one that has his name on a building. Jamie Dornan's portrayal is equally uninspired and would've been more effective had it been done by a robot. For anything would have been an improvement to his emotionless and stiff performance. Dakota Johnson's version of Anastasia Steele is purely physical and devoid of feeling. She hunches her shoulders, drops her head and averts her eyes, but she doesn't inhabit the personality or character. Johnson does her best impression of acting, even desperately overacting at times to compensate for her co-star's inability to emote.So the characters and plot suck, but surely a film about BDSM has to still be entertaining, right? Wrong. Fifty Shades of Grey is about as sexually adventurous and innovative as vanilla yogurt. The audience of the theater I was in was in a fit of giggles because it is so dreadful it is cringe-worthy and awkward. This isn't BDSM, this isn't even kink or fetish, this is just sex: guy on top, holding your hands up above your head sex.Friends, family, generous guests: I implore you not to waste your time or hard earned money on this garbage. There's more kink in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than a 125 minute film based on source material stretching an unimaginable 500 pages, woof. The best thing about the film is the Crazy in Love remix by Beyonce.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,......Oh dear....,"I didn't want to bother doing a review for this movie, because being honest it doesn't deserve any more of my time. Nor your's for that matter. Getting straight to the point, a lot of this movie just doesn't work. At all.Based on the inanely stupid book of the same name you have cardboard cut out sheltered chick Anastasia Steele (yeah, really) and kinky billionaire Christian Grey who partake in confusing bondage sex that actually barely appears in the movie. Yep the most anticipated movie in years because of it's graphic sexual content and Twilight mum fan base that trolls the internet doesn't feature much sex.So if there's little sex in a movie all about bondage, bdsm and all that stuff what can we rely on to carry the movie? A good story? If you've read the books you already know the answer to that question (those who haven't, it's garbage). Good and interesting characters? The main characters have less engaging chemistry than a two hour chemistry lecture presented by a professor who should have retired a hundred years ago at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. If there was a huge amount of sex going on in this movie it would be more awkward and uncomfortable as opposed to sexy. Why? Because there is zero sexual tension in this movie which culminates in it committing the worst sex movie/porno sin...inducing boredom. Severe boredom.I give this movie props for two things: one it's actually shot fairly well and does it's best to create an intimate atmosphere (unfortunately the dialogue and awkwardness undoes all that hard work) Secondly at least it's not as laughably bad as the book its based on. Two kinda positive points results in it being given a 2/10.Thanks for reading and if you found this helpful /enjoyable check out my other reviews.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Warning! Read this If you liked this movie! Seriously important!,"If you liked this movie either you are a female in hunger or a man with personality disorders. I read in a newspaper that a recent study reported that the woman who find this movie to be good have serious repressed sexuality issues. On the other hand, the guys who enjoy this movie apparently had problems in early stages of sexuality development. So if you had psychological growing issues during the organization of your individualization (separating from your mother) you will, for sure, like this movie; you can even feel some kind of pleasure by watching this perverted man (with serious sado-masochism disorders). It goes deeper in the early stages of the sexual development as Freud described it. I'm referring to the anal phase. The retention and lose of the faeces. The way you deal with it, and you cope, could determine sexually fixations, such as this. To the woman who wrote this story, this is also true; but, anyway, all the movies tells a lot about the ones who wrote them. Actually it seems that the movie could act as some form of catharsis, helping the writer to externalize her deepest, repressed and not fully-understanding desires. I must tell you, also, that this sexuality behaviour is not normal. Most of the people don't engage in this type of sexuality (wich in fact consists in a behavioural deviation) as the main form of satisfying their desires. Thankfuly! So, be warned. If you are one of those, there's still hope. Find a good analyst and deal with it. The world is full of people in psychological need. Don't be ashamed to ask for help, or cry for freedom.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Film Review: Fifty Shades of Grey/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason.If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn't know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time.It's not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn't exist before E.L. James' novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism.I'm not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screen writing and acting skills, you can't do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film's production.Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate's (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper's article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it.Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn't meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself?The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days?Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people's lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine's Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of 'love' for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?Fifty Shades of Grey is a film void of romance, as is the chemistry between its leads. Forcing to become lovers: one a submissive and one a dominant, is clearly seen between the chemistry of Johnson and Dornan. Looking more like two people exploring the world of James' highly clich√©d and unoriginal imagination, Johnson and Dornan look strapped and tied to fake and cheap material within every frame. Hopefully, the scars and marks left from the production doesn't act as a metaphorical stain for these two talented actors for the rest of their careers by being typed casted.My biggest concern of the film is if, by forcing this popular notion of submission and dominance to young girls, charmed and enthralled by the glamorized and wholly unreal Christian Grey ever going to be taken advantage of by older, predatorily type males? What type of message does this source material and film send women who are naive, submissive, innocent and easily charmed by the erotically charged notion of rich men with high brow toys being able to get away with anything they want? Violence, language and difficult subject matters are always at the forefront of rating controversy, yet this film was easily given an R rating, when it's message is one that needs to be taken seriously and cautiously, especially for young women.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Not the best movie!!!!,"I watched this movie because everyone was talking about it. After 10 minutes, I was laughing. I definitely will agree with everyone there was no chemistry between the two actors. it is actually uncomfortable to watch. The actress does not fit and the actor even worse, he is good looking but that it. Out of curiosity I decided to read to books, to understand if it is the movie or the whole story that was bad. I finished those books in less than a week, English is not my first language but you can tell that it was poorly written and not much documented about BDSM. I give two stars for the music. I think the books and the movie got so much attention because of people talking and teenager trying to get the kick.2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Pointless Crap! 2/10,"Review: What a load of rubbish! After all the dominating talk about what he's going to do with her with his weird and wonderful toys, he ends up falling in love with her and realises that he can't live without her so what is the point of this 2 hour long movie. The storyline is extremely simple! Basically, woman meets man! Man & Woman fall for each other! Man has a weird sex appetite! They Get It On! Simple! I thought there was going to be some major twists or some extremely explicit sex scenes but it was two hours of watching two people falling in love. I can see why women might have liked the attraction to a really warped minded man and intriguing billionaire but from a man's point of view, it's boring and pointless. The acting wasn't bad because I was intrigued about the individuals background but I can't help feeling cheated. Maybe it's better on paper than it is on the big screen! Anyway, it certainly took a lot of money at the box office so there's obviously an audience for this type of movie but I really didn't get why there is so much hype surrounding it. Terrible!Round-Up: For a movie that is based around two characters falling in love, I really can't see were the $40million budget went. Jamie Doman has only really starred in TV series, except for his role in Marie Antoinette so he was a weird choice for this major blockbuster. Dakota Johnson has starred in quite a lot of movies, like 21 Jump Street, Need For Speed, The Social Network and Black Mass starring Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch so she's obviously got a lot of experience on the big screen. Personally, I haven't heard of her before so I thought that she was a newcomer. Anyway, the director, Samantha Taylor- Johnson, has only directed 2 other movies in her career which are Districted, Nowhere Boy. Maybe her lack of experience is what makes this movie so bad. Its been reported that she won't be returning to make Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed so there's a possibility that they might be much better than this rubbish.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $570million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic movies about a woman who falls in love with a billionaire who has a weird, sexual appetite. 2/10",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Aside of the controversial story, this is a sorry excuse of a movie","Aside of the story being extremely controversial (it is still beyond me why this story has enjoyed so much appeal among women), my take on the movies from a pure movie making perspective is this: Although to be fair, this is an extremely complex movie to make with all those conflicted emotions and unspoken thoughts and feelings. However, the exaggerated acting, tacky scenery, and weird inconsistent sequence of events did not make it any easier to convey the story properly. I think the casting altogether was not done properly. Nor was the level of details chosen.All in all it was a really poor movie, I lost interest in the first 20 mins, and was honestly disappointed to see it through till the end.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 shades of boring,"I finally got around to seeing this after all the hype had died down and I can say it is not worth your time. The directing is bad, the acting is bad and the story line is worse.Plenty of flyby helicopter scenes of Seattle are supposed to impress on us that Mr. Grey is a billionaire and therefore able to do whatever he wants according to US mythology. Dazzled by all this cash, our heroine walks into his torture lair, complete with red leather sofa, where he casually tells her he is a ""Dominant"" that will punish her for disobeying him and reward her for pleasing him. This turns her on so much, that she decides to let him ""reward"" her on the spot. Give me a break.The movie devolves from there. Skip it for the the real thing, or better yet a real movie.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,I Put A Spell On You,"People talk like this is the worst movie ever made, like it's some Ed Wood Plan 9 fiasco. Well, it's a very bad movie all right. But it's not that bad.Can you really hate a movie that starts with a sexy cover version of Screaming Jay Hawkins' ""I Put A Spell On You"" over the opening titles? I mean, Creedence Clearwater Revival covered that song. It's Fifties rock, and it's the real deal!(Idea for a movie: John Fogerty plays a beloved sixty-something rock legend who has a secret side as a pain-inflicting Dom! They call him the Midnight Choogler . . .)Anyway, this movie is horrible, but not because there's too much brutal violence or hardcore sex. It's just that Master Grey, the handsome boy billionaire who like to tie women up and punish them, lacks all human personality and is a totally lifeless character. Fifty Shades is not a real romance, because there is no romantic hero. There's just an empty suit.See, when you read a real romance, like OUTLANDER by Diana Gabaldon, the hero is dark and tortured for reasons that have weight and stature. He's a guy who commands respect from everyone, not just one impressionable young girl. He's a guy who has already proved himself in ways that involve real blood, sweat, and danger. If someone's going to spank a young girl, it ought to be someone who knows something about pain. A brawler with a broadsword, a warrior from a proud people, not some faceless billionaire who pushes buttons.Fifty Shades fails because this Grey guy is just not an interesting person. His sexual tastes may be interesting, or shocking, but other than that, so what? Think about Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula. Women find him fascinating for reasons that have nothing to do with his vampire nature. Like when they ask him about fixing up his new home, Carfax Abbey, and he says, ""I shall do very little repairing. It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle, in Transylvania."" Dracula is a man with a past, a real identity, real allure. Christian Grey is banal, empty, as lifeless as the models last year's fashion magazines.I keep wanting to say that Dakota Johnson was great as Anastasia. She was, but only because the script actually gives her something to work against. Oh, and I love the fact that her blonde roommate turns out to be nice and not killed at the end.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I could deal with the SM, but not with the male lead","This movie seemed preposterous to me. I mean, I've got no problem with the idea that some people are turned on by being dominant, even by inflicting pain, and I'm equally O.K. with the idea that others might be turned on by being submissive, or even (though more rarely) from receiving pain. But I can't get my head around the idea that a beautiful, sexy, smart, interesting woman like Anastasia (as portrayed by Dakota Johnson) would have any interest at all in a mindless, boring, selfish, cardboard cutout of a man like Christian. He has money. Great. That's always a plus. But is having money really enough to make up for his utter lack of any discernable personality? I don't understand what would motivate this woman to do anything she does.1 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Grey has sex...that's about it.,"I cannot believe I actually watched this. Me, who solemnly swore he wouldn't watch such rubbish, made the bold choice to watch this for the sake of his friend. That's how kind I am. I would succumb to this for friendship. Honestly though, this has less substance than a used condom. I'm not even going to summarise the ""plot"", because there was hardly any. Young girl falls in love with rich man who creates a contract for some submissive dominance relationship thing. I don't know, and I don't care. The film is shot well atleast, and has aesthetic appeal. Don't forget the hardcore foreplay and rough sex...oh wait, it's tame? Oh dear. I've seen more convincing sex (and better plot) in a 70's soft porno. The screenplay can be best described as monotonous. Example: ""I don't make love. I f*ck...hard"". Or even: ""Because I'm fifty shades of f*cked up, Anastasia"". What even was this!? Have we, the human race, actually come to this!? I can't comprehend the stupidity of this dialogue and how undramatic it was. The most excitement I had was attempting to work out the word for a 'vagina wig' which I'm sure Dakota Johnson was wearing. ""Hmmm I know it sounds like mankini? No wait, I'll FaceTime my mum, she'll know...MERKIN! It's a merkin!"". The sex, which the plot clearly revolves around, is too funny to watch. Whips, chains, rope...we got it all, and it's hilarious. Then the accompaniment of generic pop songs, oh yes it gets better. Bursting into Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" has never felt so good. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were abysmal, not their fault though to be fair. Goes to show that a screenplay is the most central and important aspect to a captivating film. And captivating this is not. However, my life is now complete. This film brought me joy. It is so atrocious that I actually loved it. Get ready for when I watch the sequel, I can't wait...",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Why!,"This one goes out to all the negative whiners out there who saw the film - marketing on Fifty Shades was brilliant and that's why Hollywood is laughing all the way to the bank at its $85 mill opener. Yes, at your expense! It has made it's $40 mill back and then some.It's a thin line between love and hate or whether fans/non fans consent to Fifty Shades. This is the perfect film that everyone wants to beat up. Let's talk about it at the water cooler at work or give up our two cents worth of analogies on the Net, Facebook, Twitter or wherever. Hollywood executives dream.I can see them all around the boardroom table feverishly pitching this film.""So we got this Fifty Shades film- """"How many copies did the books sell?""""Hundred million or so, but...""""We'll release it Valentine's Day!""""The thing is it's not exactly a romance...more along the lines of S&M...""""What did I tell you about romance...now get me the crop!""For those of you that didn't favour the books, yet still went to see this film with eyes wide open...too bad, so sad you got duped out of your pocket money. Nobody forced or subjected you to go see it -there's the door, use it, and don't let it hit your butt on the way out!Reviewers have been rather sadistic about the movie, saying it doesn't accurately represent kink or the occasional detour into S&M. Or dating. Or journalism. Or billionaires. Or chemistry. Or romance. Or love. Or the way human beings speak. In other words, it's just like every other Hollywood film.As for the sex part - it doesn't happen until 40 minutes into the movie (shout out goes to the gal that actually timed the first sex scene) and there is 11 minutes in total. Somehow, I can't get the image out of my head of a woman feverishly sitting in a theatre with a stop watch!As for the domestic violence part, I've viewed way more abuse in a litany of other films and on TV. I could give you a list, but frankly I couldn't be bothered too much work. Which makes me ponder if Ghomeshi's damage control team are paying attention, taking notes on what constitutes consensual sex. Having said that...I didn't see the rape connotations reviewers are attributing to this film, but I did witness a girl willing to experiment and test her own boundaries. It was a power struggle between two people about having control. Christian wanted to control all aspects of Anastasia's life. She was not willing to relinquish total control over to him and in that way she was holding all the cards, which made her powerful. Yes, you can walk a fine line right into abuse, but she had the option to leave at anytime or say ""No!"" She wanted to know what made him tick and didn't bank on the consequences of finding out.My personal take on this film is irrelevant, but here goes - it was slow, dull-witted, void of any cohesive storyline. It was not meant to be a romance as mentioned above. Maybe if the leads delivered their lines better, shared some mutual real passion or chemistry, were actually believable - the public wouldn't be so enraged at Fifty Shades of Box Office Bliss!But...I did want to address some of the comments on here about Johnson not wanting to have fans see her movie. She made a generic statement that was taken out of context. She was referencing her parents and how she didn't want them to see her in a sex flick, kind of like how you wouldn't want to view your parents doing it. Johnson was proud of doing Fifty Shades and knew what she signed up for and she did so willingly. She studied for the part by reading and researching BDSM. Dornan went to dungeons and actually watched dominant/submissive sessions to better prepare him for his role. They hired a BDSM to give advice on set, so it would be as realistic as possible. These are quotes taken from Johnson herself - ""I'm proud of the movie. I think she's actually stronger than he is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that.""",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Waste of time and download,I do not write reviews and NEVER commented on a movie before ... however this one asks for it :DI gotta totally agree with majority of reviews i red ... this movie is really crap ... gentle erotic rewrite of Twilight movie series ... this stuff is only for naive teenage girls ... it was hardly the effort of download and really don't understand why would people go for such movie to cinemas ... my sincere condolences to all guys who HAD TO go with their girls to movies to watch it. Well at least hope popcorn was fresh and beer was nicely chilled guys. I had to PAUSE this movie several times ... it was unbearable (breath taking and mind blowing comedy like) ... anyway this is only my point of view.Gotta say .. i enjoyed the collection of cars (thou even that i would question) and the helicopter was not bad ... ;)1 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that!","'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY': One Star (Out of Five)The blockbuster film adaptation of the best-selling book, of the same name, about a 21-year-old virgin college student, who engages in an increasingly disturbing relationship with a sadomasochist industrialist. It was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and written by Kelly Marcel. The novel was written by E.L. James and was first published as 'Twilight' fan fiction, on different fan websites. The movie stars young newcomers Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, as it's two leads. Both the book and it's film adaptation have been heavily criticized for promoting sexual abuse and violence against women (by The National Center on Sexual Exploitation and various other people and groups); although the movie is supposedly extremely toned down from the novel it's adapted from (including the elimination of a scene of questionable rape). I found the film to be very disturbing, as well as laughably bad and pretty poorly made. Critics, and a majority of viewers, have mostly found the film adaptation to be better made than the book though (even though it maintains an average rating of 4.2, out of 10, on both the rottentomatoes and IMDb websites).Johnson stars as Anastasia Steele; a 21-year-old undergraduate at Washington State University. When her roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford), becomes sick and is unable to interview a rich Seattle businessman, named Christian Grey (Dornan), for the college paper, she asks Anastasia to fill in for her. When she meets Christian, Anastasia is clumsy, awkward and very shy. He's immediately drawn to her for these reasons. Grey then proceeds to stalk her; at the hardware store where she works and then at a bar, she calls him drunk from. He takes her home to his place, when she passes out wasted. Despite all the entrepreneur's illegal, and extremely creepy, behavior towards her, Anastasia also finds herself drawn to him and the two begin a sexual relationship. Christian explains that he's a dominant and he wants Anastasia to be his submissive. When she's initially repelled by the idea, he continues to harass her into signing a legal contract; to become his sex slave.First of all the movie is really poorly written and badly acted; but I've heard the book is even worse. It's also shockingly dull and feels drastically unemotional, and very dry, for most of it's 2 hour running length. I found parts of it amusing, and I do like the way it ends, but mostly I found this film to be a complete waste of time; for anyone looking for quality entertainment at all. I also agree with the criticisms that it does promote abusive relationships and violence against women. The central relationship depicted in the movie is definitely not a healthy one, in the slightest, and the Christian Grey character is very much an abusive sexual predator. The fact that the film pretends to be some kind of a romance, as well, is really insulting (to everyone). I've always been attracted to domineering women (mostly as fantasy) but not in any way similar to this. I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbh5F6Mfw",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Crap,"This was a poorly written and unimaginative attempt at a remake of 9 1/2 Weeks that the author tried in vain to pass off as original. They didn't even bother to change the main character's name. Changing the spelling doesn't fool anyone. It was John Gray in 9 1/2 Weeks, which, by the way, was a great movie that was well cast, incorporated innovative details, and succeeded at emotionally committing its audience. Mickey Rourke did everything right to pull us in. Fifty Shades of Grey was garbage. The two stars I gave it are only for the decent soundtrack. I was able to stomach reading the first book and it was better than the movie, but that's not saying much. Dakota was a good choice to cast Anastasia, but Jamie Dornan was so unbelievable as Christian. He was boring. Just boring. All of his lines were read as if he was thinking, ""I can't believe I got this part. I'm so glad Ryan Gosling is above this fluff so I could get a shot."" If you're into flogging, go after the folks that made this waste of time and money.1 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Me, who solemnly swore he wouldn't watch such rubbish, made the bold choice to watch this for the sake of his friend. That's how kind I am. I would succumb to this for friendship. Honestly though, this has less substance than a used condom. I'm not even going to summarise the ""plot"", because there was hardly any. Young girl falls in love with rich man who creates a contract for some submissive dominance relationship thing. I don't know, and I don't care. The film is shot well atleast, and has aesthetic appeal. Don't forget the hardcore foreplay and rough sex...oh wait, it's tame? Oh dear. I've seen more convincing sex (and better plot) in a 70's soft porno. The screenplay can be best described as monotonous. Example: ""I don't make love. I f*ck...hard"". Or even: ""Because I'm fifty shades of f*cked up, Anastasia"". What even was this!? Have we, the human race, actually come to this!? I can't comprehend the stupidity of this dialogue and how undramatic it was. The most excitement I had was attempting to work out the word for a 'vagina wig' which I'm sure Dakota Johnson was wearing. ""Hmmm I know it sounds like mankini? No wait, I'll FaceTime my mum, she'll know...MERKIN! It's a merkin!"". The sex, which the plot clearly revolves around, is too funny to watch. Whips, chains, rope...we got it all, and it's hilarious. Then the accompaniment of generic pop songs, oh yes it gets better. Bursting into Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" has never felt so good. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were abysmal, not their fault though to be fair. Goes to show that a screenplay is the most central and important aspect to a captivating film. And captivating this is not. However, my life is now complete. This film brought me joy. It is so atrocious that I actually loved it. Get ready for when I watch the sequel, I can't wait...",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Can't wait to see other 2 parts of this amazig triology- said no one ever,"More like Fifty shades of nothing happening. If I wanted to watch porn I would go to Pornhub. Writing is just really really bad, I mean she asked him 1000 times why the f... is he doing that and he gave the same answer 1000 times. Dakota needs redemption after this. It doens't even deserve that nom for Oscar.1 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Aside of the controversial story, this is a sorry excuse of a movie","Aside of the story being extremely controversial (it is still beyond me why this story has enjoyed so much appeal among women), my take on the movies from a pure movie making perspective is this: Although to be fair, this is an extremely complex movie to make with all those conflicted emotions and unspoken thoughts and feelings. However, the exaggerated acting, tacky scenery, and weird inconsistent sequence of events did not make it any easier to convey the story properly. I think the casting altogether was not done properly. Nor was the level of details chosen.All in all it was a really poor movie, I lost interest in the first 20 mins, and was honestly disappointed to see it through till the end.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 shades of boring,"I finally got around to seeing this after all the hype had died down and I can say it is not worth your time. The directing is bad, the acting is bad and the story line is worse.Plenty of flyby helicopter scenes of Seattle are supposed to impress on us that Mr. Grey is a billionaire and therefore able to do whatever he wants according to US mythology. Dazzled by all this cash, our heroine walks into his torture lair, complete with red leather sofa, where he casually tells her he is a ""Dominant"" that will punish her for disobeying him and reward her for pleasing him. This turns her on so much, that she decides to let him ""reward"" her on the spot. Give me a break.The movie devolves from there. Skip it for the the real thing, or better yet a real movie.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Film Review: Fifty Shades of Grey/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason.If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn't know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time.It's not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn't exist before E.L. James' novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism.I'm not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screen writing and acting skills, you can't do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film's production.Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate's (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper's article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it.Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn't meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself?The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days?Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people's lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine's Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of 'love' for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?Fifty Shades of Grey is a film void of romance, as is the chemistry between its leads. Forcing to become lovers: one a submissive and one a dominant, is clearly seen between the chemistry of Johnson and Dornan. Looking more like two people exploring the world of James' highly clich√©d and unoriginal imagination, Johnson and Dornan look strapped and tied to fake and cheap material within every frame. Hopefully, the scars and marks left from the production doesn't act as a metaphorical stain for these two talented actors for the rest of their careers by being typed casted.My biggest concern of the film is if, by forcing this popular notion of submission and dominance to young girls, charmed and enthralled by the glamorized and wholly unreal Christian Grey ever going to be taken advantage of by older, predatorily type males? What type of message does this source material and film send women who are naive, submissive, innocent and easily charmed by the erotically charged notion of rich men with high brow toys being able to get away with anything they want? Violence, language and difficult subject matters are always at the forefront of rating controversy, yet this film was easily given an R rating, when it's message is one that needs to be taken seriously and cautiously, especially for young women.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Not the best movie!!!!,"I watched this movie because everyone was talking about it. After 10 minutes, I was laughing. I definitely will agree with everyone there was no chemistry between the two actors. it is actually uncomfortable to watch. The actress does not fit and the actor even worse, he is good looking but that it. Out of curiosity I decided to read to books, to understand if it is the movie or the whole story that was bad. I finished those books in less than a week, English is not my first language but you can tell that it was poorly written and not much documented about BDSM. I give two stars for the music. I think the books and the movie got so much attention because of people talking and teenager trying to get the kick.2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Pointless Crap! 2/10,"Review: What a load of rubbish! After all the dominating talk about what he's going to do with her with his weird and wonderful toys, he ends up falling in love with her and realises that he can't live without her so what is the point of this 2 hour long movie. The storyline is extremely simple! Basically, woman meets man! Man & Woman fall for each other! Man has a weird sex appetite! They Get It On! Simple! I thought there was going to be some major twists or some extremely explicit sex scenes but it was two hours of watching two people falling in love. I can see why women might have liked the attraction to a really warped minded man and intriguing billionaire but from a man's point of view, it's boring and pointless. The acting wasn't bad because I was intrigued about the individuals background but I can't help feeling cheated. Maybe it's better on paper than it is on the big screen! Anyway, it certainly took a lot of money at the box office so there's obviously an audience for this type of movie but I really didn't get why there is so much hype surrounding it. Terrible!Round-Up: For a movie that is based around two characters falling in love, I really can't see were the $40million budget went. Jamie Doman has only really starred in TV series, except for his role in Marie Antoinette so he was a weird choice for this major blockbuster. Dakota Johnson has starred in quite a lot of movies, like 21 Jump Street, Need For Speed, The Social Network and Black Mass starring Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch so she's obviously got a lot of experience on the big screen. Personally, I haven't heard of her before so I thought that she was a newcomer. Anyway, the director, Samantha Taylor- Johnson, has only directed 2 other movies in her career which are Districted, Nowhere Boy. Maybe her lack of experience is what makes this movie so bad. Its been reported that she won't be returning to make Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed so there's a possibility that they might be much better than this rubbish.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $570million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic movies about a woman who falls in love with a billionaire who has a weird, sexual appetite. 2/10",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Warning! Read this If you liked this movie! Seriously important!,"If you liked this movie either you are a female in hunger or a man with personality disorders. I read in a newspaper that a recent study reported that the woman who find this movie to be good have serious repressed sexuality issues. On the other hand, the guys who enjoy this movie apparently had problems in early stages of sexuality development. So if you had psychological growing issues during the organization of your individualization (separating from your mother) you will, for sure, like this movie; you can even feel some kind of pleasure by watching this perverted man (with serious sado-masochism disorders). It goes deeper in the early stages of the sexual development as Freud described it. I'm referring to the anal phase. The retention and lose of the faeces. The way you deal with it, and you cope, could determine sexually fixations, such as this. To the woman who wrote this story, this is also true; but, anyway, all the movies tells a lot about the ones who wrote them. Actually it seems that the movie could act as some form of catharsis, helping the writer to externalize her deepest, repressed and not fully-understanding desires. I must tell you, also, that this sexuality behaviour is not normal. Most of the people don't engage in this type of sexuality (wich in fact consists in a behavioural deviation) as the main form of satisfying their desires. Thankfuly! So, be warned. If you are one of those, there's still hope. Find a good analyst and deal with it. The world is full of people in psychological need. Don't be ashamed to ask for help, or cry for freedom.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,......Oh dear....,"I didn't want to bother doing a review for this movie, because being honest it doesn't deserve any more of my time. Nor your's for that matter. Getting straight to the point, a lot of this movie just doesn't work. At all.Based on the inanely stupid book of the same name you have cardboard cut out sheltered chick Anastasia Steele (yeah, really) and kinky billionaire Christian Grey who partake in confusing bondage sex that actually barely appears in the movie. Yep the most anticipated movie in years because of it's graphic sexual content and Twilight mum fan base that trolls the internet doesn't feature much sex.So if there's little sex in a movie all about bondage, bdsm and all that stuff what can we rely on to carry the movie? A good story? If you've read the books you already know the answer to that question (those who haven't, it's garbage). Good and interesting characters? The main characters have less engaging chemistry than a two hour chemistry lecture presented by a professor who should have retired a hundred years ago at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. If there was a huge amount of sex going on in this movie it would be more awkward and uncomfortable as opposed to sexy. Why? Because there is zero sexual tension in this movie which culminates in it committing the worst sex movie/porno sin...inducing boredom. Severe boredom.I give this movie props for two things: one it's actually shot fairly well and does it's best to create an intimate atmosphere (unfortunately the dialogue and awkwardness undoes all that hard work) Secondly at least it's not as laughably bad as the book its based on. Two kinda positive points results in it being given a 2/10.Thanks for reading and if you found this helpful /enjoyable check out my other reviews.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"An atrocity, more kink and originality in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than this 125 minute film","You've heard from all the rest, now hear from the best movie site about this year's biggest mistake: Fifty Shades of Grey.You might be surprised by this fact, but this twenty-something female never read the 50 Shades series by E.L. James. As a member of the novel's target demographic fan base, you know the group that allegedly goes gaga for this crap, let me break it down for you folks out there.Even if you avoided hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey with a fervent effort, you probably were susceptible to some information about the film and book series. You know, assuming you don't live under a rock or are some survivalist living off the grid while you prepare for the end of the world. So a summary of the film and series is basically unnecessary. There's this meek girl named Anastasia Steele who meets a billionaire named Christian Grey. For some inexplicable reason they are captivated by one another and their lust-affair begins.Who here has watched porn? For those of you that didn't raise your hand, please skip to the next paragraph. For those of you who did, or should have because you are a liar, then read on. So you know that formula in porn, doesn't matter if its teacher-student, boss-secretary or housewife-handyman the recipe remains the same: BS dialogue to feign a reason for these two (or three) people getting it on and then bam: naked sex city! Nobody actually pays attention to what the porn stars are saying, not even the production companies, because nine times out of ten the video you are watching is free from any one of the known purveyors of this service. Same goes for this trash but rather than lasting about two or three minutes like with porn, it lasts close to forty minutes in the film.E.L. James wants you to think Christian Grey is this sexual, magnetic and mesmerizing man. You'll have to take James's word for it because there is nothing that actually serves as proof in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. There is more chemistry between Christian Grey and his suit than with Anastasia Steele. For a film whose whole foundation relies upon the main characters' inherent and undeniable attraction, this is kind of a big deal. From the initial meet-cute, which is just contrived exposition, the rest of the film unravels as the series of far-fetched events that theoretically lead to this, I guess you could call it, relationship.The character of Christian Grey is just your average billionaire playboy clich√©, you know the type, the one that has his name on a building. Jamie Dornan's portrayal is equally uninspired and would've been more effective had it been done by a robot. For anything would have been an improvement to his emotionless and stiff performance. Dakota Johnson's version of Anastasia Steele is purely physical and devoid of feeling. She hunches her shoulders, drops her head and averts her eyes, but she doesn't inhabit the personality or character. Johnson does her best impression of acting, even desperately overacting at times to compensate for her co-star's inability to emote.So the characters and plot suck, but surely a film about BDSM has to still be entertaining, right? Wrong. Fifty Shades of Grey is about as sexually adventurous and innovative as vanilla yogurt. The audience of the theater I was in was in a fit of giggles because it is so dreadful it is cringe-worthy and awkward. This isn't BDSM, this isn't even kink or fetish, this is just sex: guy on top, holding your hands up above your head sex.Friends, family, generous guests: I implore you not to waste your time or hard earned money on this garbage. There's more kink in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than a 125 minute film based on source material stretching an unimaginable 500 pages, woof. The best thing about the film is the Crazy in Love remix by Beyonce.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disappointing,"This film was being advertised and raved about all over Brisbane a couple of years ago. It piqued my interest, and I just now got the opportunity to watch it. What a letdown. The actors have little on-screen chemistry; the scenes, although somewhat erotic at times, are pretty clich√©d; the storyline is predictable and the ending is unresolved. Even the support actors did little to raise the level of acting. Much better watching for suggestive eroticism is 9 1/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger, or if you want a silly but entertaining romantic romp, select a Hugh Grant movie, which at least will involve a reasonably high level of acting.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Dull Shades of Grey,"Okay, lets make this simple. After all the hype about the books, I was curious to see what many had come to love about the series. Now i have never read the book, but this movie was just plain awful. Without spoiling any of the ""story"" let me just say this. The acting was a shameful experience. Both characters where very unlikeable. I think what to blame is that there was NO character development. Basically giving you 2 characters and throwing them into a dull plot. The 2 characters are supposed to be adults. Yet this plays out like a teeny- bopper film. What I think really killed the movie was the very very very poorly written script. Awful dialog. Very dull, uninteresting, and unoriginal. Now i am somebody that loves movies and tries to find the artistic and special parts that make all movies enjoyable. But I am sorry Fifty Shades, even with an open mind to movies and film like mine, I just couldn't find anything good about this film. Its a real shame. I had thought with the success and popularity over the novel, that the writers would put a little more effort and time into making this movie watchable, but despite all that this was a flop. If the sequels are like this, why not go straight to DVD?",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,What was the movie about?,"I had no idea what all this 50 shades of Grey phenomenon was about before watching the movie. Regrettably, after watching it, I still have no clue what it is about. From what I understand, the book has proved a hit within a majority of woman who are generally speaking not really into literature. The type of women who normally devour hello magazine, and felt a need to upgrade to fifty shades of Grey to fantasize about a similar experience with a billionaire.But in the movie, there's no room for fantasy as you are shown images and you have to go with the acting. Your mind doesn't take you further than the screen. So if you stick to it, what is left is very very little. While the girl (Anastasia) shows some decent acting skills and she might need another movie to prove her worth, the guy (Christian Grey) was mediocre at best. He doesn't make you believe about the character for a second. I doubt he'll have a successful career if he is not saved by his looks.The only thing that could have saved the movie was if they had wished to create some suspense around the character and the origins of his mentally disturbed personality. Sadly, the person who adapted the script thought this was an unimportant piece of information for the viewer, so when the girl asks to know more about Christian Grey's past, what you get is a simple: ""I can't tell you or you would hate me"". Wow!! A truly unforgettable line!Honestly, I have real doubts that culturally-aware people will have any interest in the book, and surely not one person will find this flick anymore interesting, unless they are the type to like Jersey Shore or some other rubbish Reality TV show.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Waste of time and money,"I read the 1st book when it came out (back in 2011) and since it was the first time I read something like that I found it tolerable. But this movie was horrible! Maybe it's because I'm not 21 anymore, maybe 4 years gap made me realize what a pathetic story this is or maybe the producers didn't do a good job with adaptation.Anyway, the movie made me cringe for the first half and bored out of my mind for the second half.I went last night expecting to see hot, intense and interesting male protagonist and dull, boring and annoying female lead. But I got exactly opposite. Jamie Dornan was horrible choice for C.G., he didn't portray strength and sexiness, he more looked like he was constipating and he delivered his lines without a bit of charm. Extremely bland actor. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is Dakota Johnson. She did her absolutely best with what she got, she even made Ana look not like a complete fool (which I thought would be impossible).I get why this move was such a hit (books were a huge hit, it was very well marketed etc.) but I think that people who go to see the next one should be automatically refereed to their doctor for hearing, eye and mental check.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A Glorified Porno for Repressed Young Women,"Understandably you may have been led to believe from Fifty Shades of Grey's marketing that it is edgy, racy and sexy. It is none of the above, yes you heard me correct and have been sorely mislead, but at least the marketing was highly successful.It is necessary to understand how the film came about, no pun intended. It was adapted from the poorly written book of the same name by ""author"" E. L. James, which in turn was adapted from a fan fiction of 'Twilight', all of this figures. Many of the plot points and events are parallels to the 'Twilight' saga and lines like ""I'm not the man for you"" feel directly lifted from it.But at least the film gets some things right, which is another way of saying barely anything at all. The film is well shot which is unsurprising when it is Seamus McGarvey who photographed the exquisite Avengers. However, this becomes redundant when the film you are photographing is utter trite.The music though, sounds like the things of wet dreams, yet never quite reaches the full potential of composer Danny Elfman, who is somewhat underutilized, as the majority of the film has techno pop songs thrown into the sound scape. 'Love Me Like You Do' is as expected the best element of Fifty Shades and Ellie Goulding's vocals accelerate the intimacy very well. I would rather listen to it a hundred times on a loop than watch the two or three inevitable sequels, depending on whether they split the last book in half.One more element that must be considered before I go on an endless rant is Dakota Johnson who plays Anastasia Steele sounding awfully like a female porn star. She gets the chance to interview renounced Billionaire Christian Grey and they build a rapport to say the least. Johnson really should not be here leaving a giant mess of a film making a bad impact on her limited filmography. If this is the one that she expected to launch her into the atmosphere then God help her. She does the best with what she is given bless her. Mainly biting her lip and trembling with anticipation to be punished by Mr. Grey played by Jamie Dornan who has no idea what he is doing in any scene that he is in, it begs the question; does he even know how to have sex? Dornan is just plain and simply bland and bad, he delivers his lines with the dramatic resonance of a new comer to a soap opera. Almost winking at the camera like a reality TV star from Geordie Shore. At least he has the looks because otherwise he would have nothing going for him, this level of acting I expect to find in a low budget pornographic film, not a Hollywood Blockbuster or is that Block Basher?Which unfortunately brings me to the script. I do not think there has been one this awful and misguided since 'Twilight', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth'. It is the work of four amateurs (or at least it feels that way) and it sticks out like a sore thumb. How four people mashed together this terrible script is beyond any comprehension because it stinks. I have seen better work by one person, Aaron Sorkin, he seems to be one of the few script writers that actually possesses a working brain. The lines do induce laughs, but unintentional ones. You never feel that Grey and Steele are connected emotionally; they are only together because the script is insistent that they are. I fail to see what Anastasia gets out of their sexual encounters apart from losing her cherry. Mr Grey spanks her butt and that is all there is to it. No chemistry whatsoever. Dornan is like a plank of wood, but Johnson reaches to inject her character with some well needed development and tries to make sparks fly, they are just nowhere to be seen. If this is true love, then I think I have more sexual tension with my Blu- ray Surround Sound System.It is far too long and padded to the limit; and I thought 'The Hobbit' and 'The Hunger Games Mockingjay' where stretched to the max, within an inch of their lives. We have to sit through endless talking about mundane topics, which will seem sexual to a male audience under the age of twelve and a female audience under the age of sixteen. In the UK, 'Fifty Shades of Sh*te' is an 18, so they are unable to view it. The only audience members it therefore has are forty-year-old women who have tragic sex lives and unwilling couples who are fooled into watching it because it is released on Valentine's Day.Yes, there are sex scenes and we see Johnson's boobs and butt. However, this does not mean it is worth the ticket price; I do not care how amazing they both are! Dornan simply stares at her like the male equivalent of Bella and there we have it Twilight with rough sex! Which includes BDSM, but the writers seem to have glanced at what a Wikipedia page can tell you! There is no understanding prevalent in the film and Steele seems to be uncomfortable as her bum is slapped about. Just a hint, now might be the time to use your safe word.I can go on for no longer and cannot review what is the worst excuse for a film and not only the worst film of 2015, but also the worst film ever made. 'Batman and Robin' you have been robbed of your kingly crown. Don't take your loved one to see it. You may lose them forever. Just have a romantic night in with any of the following films, 'Titanic', 'Annie Hall', 'Beauty and the Beast', '(500) Days of Summer' or 'Her'. Save yourself from this colossal cum stain of a film.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disappointment,"After watching the movie, I cannot stop being disappointed for almost every single moment throughout the entire film! It just, you know, kind of having so many confusing scenes which causes audiences misunderstand what's going on, what the film actually features about. One more point is that the film doesn't show how important the 2 main character are because they played their scenes constrainedly. I think that they should have some more scenes so that they can link together and make the audience easily get to the main aim of the director or the film maker. For the rest of the series, they should have considered more about which necessary scenes they should put on so that the audience can enjoy them positively not like with the first one.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Terrible everything,"I don't know if it is fair for me to write this review as I am only 24 minutes into the movie and forcing myself to keep watching. The acting is absolutely terrible I have my face scrunched up. To be fair to Jamie Dornan he is better than Dakota Johnson even though his accent is appalling, Dakota Johnson is awkward, irritating and talks slowly to try and give off the impression of being nervous, there is no chemistry between the two actors or characters, they are awkward and I don't see any connection. I don't really have anything else to say as by the end of writing this review I am so bored with the film it is getting turned off as I would rather do History homework.

Fifty Shades of Grey,An A for Effort,"Extremely drab.The book has seemingly been written as a joke, and the movie looked like a lot of effort and cash has been spent in vain.The primary theme is s/m; the movie made a good effort at retaining the fine line between a commercial movie and porn. However, that somehow defeated the purpose. Did I also mention how lackluster the plot is? Not to mention, the bizarre way the plot ends. The credit goes to the author, though. Book writing is not for everyone. The next time i come across ""fan fiction"", i'll steer clear. The movie was a better effort than the book.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Waited 2 hr for something to happen,"This movie views as awkward as the book reads. The least graphic way I can describe it is picture something a 50 year virgin old-maid who has lived with cats all her life would write, but only after being in a body cast for 2 months with no sexual release.Its just awkward, the dialect is forced and everything in the story conveniently just happens to go their way. Its not plausible in anyway and to top it off, its BORING. I kept waiting for something of a actual story line to emerge from the miasma but nothing came. Even the music seemed mono-toned when paired with the often black and white back-grounds and muddled mood lighting The only reason I gave it 2 stars is its slightly better then Freddy Got Fingered3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,avoid like the plague,"I have not read the books so i went into this as a neutral and gotta say the hype for this film left me with a question..why?? as this was the biggest load of rubbish i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films. The story is just awful the wording and quotes said in the film make you want to rip of your ears then dip your head in a bowl of vinegar, why would a talented actress like dakota johnson play the role of a woman who is a pathetic sexual play toy for a twisted rich bloke. I get some people are into things like this but why oh why would you turn it into a 2 hour film? My advice if your into this try going on your laptop and enter google but avoid this film as the only thing that was good about this was the soundtrack3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Embarrassed to admit I watched this.,"A close friend of mine enjoyed the books and really wanted to see this movie. I wasn't so thrilled since the same friend talked me into reading the first novel in the series about 8 months back and I felt it was an immature, poorly edited book. (If one can even consider Twilight fan-fic a real novel..)Needless to say I had very low expectations going into this film, and my expectations were mostly correct. There were a few nice set pieces, and a couple of moments where the filmmakers obviously tried to rise above their source material. That's the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1..Aside from a few OK scenes though, this movie is mostly awful.. There was NO chemistry between the two leads IMO. And for a movie whose subject matter is based almost entirely around S&M, there was extremely little to be found here. I did not expect the film to be a pornography, but considering the book reads like grocery store soft-core, I was surprised that the movie was so tame. It was boring really, almost painfully so.If you must watch this movie, wait til it hits DVD or on-demand, don't waste theater ticket money to watch it...",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Grey is literally Grey and really disappointing....,"I am a huge fan of the book. I love that it's different from any romance novel I know. But this movie which is an adaption to the book that I refer to is really disappointing. I think Jamie should return to acting school because the only thing that is good about him is his look and if that is the only good thing about him than he should have been a model not an actor. I love Dakota. I think she is funny and beautiful in a way that not many people see. The lack of chemistry in this movie does not go unnoticed and of course that is another disappointment from this movie. And maybe for those who have read the book, I believe you notice that the story in this movie was told way too fast. This is the main problem that I have with the movie. It's just too fast! They forgot to put many little details from the book into the movie and because of that I could not have the same connection with the movie that i have with the book. For those who haven't read the book, I suggest you not to watch this movie because you WILL be disappointed with this movie, especially if you are just curious about all the hype that is fifty shades of grey. Overall, Fifty Shades of Grey is indeed grey. It's bland and it's grey, simple as that. I just hope the next movie won't be as disappointing as this.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Disappointing,"This is my first review but I had to write something about this movie. It was a very disappointing one. I left the movie half way through. Christian seemed pretending to be someone he clearly wasn't. Anna was better in her performance but soon joined Christian's league. In the beginning of the movie, I got a feeling that Anna was trying to be intimated by Christian more than Christian doing something to intimidate her at the interview. He almost seemed boyish. When Anna trips at the door to Christian's cabin, it was one of the most predictable scenes that one could see. Their discussions over the clauses in the agreement for whatever he wanted to do, was a joke. It was a very wooden performance. This subject did not seem to be a new one but even with that, they could have made a much better movie had they not tried to force a wolf's skin over a lamb.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Rubbish!,There was such a big hype for this film and yet i have just wasted ¬£9 at my local cinema watching this garbage people call a 'fanstastic film'. The acting was so unrealistic (jamie dornan is fit though). It just all seemed so awkward watching it and there was definitely not enough sex in there! So much for it being 'the raunchiest' film of the year. Got my hopes up for nothing. And that ending well it was a stupid cliffhanger how can it just end like that really? The sequel will probably take another 3 years to come out. Not a happy viewer i expected well more. The books in my opinion were so much better! I hope the next film is good3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,You don't want to see this!,"Poor, poor movie. I don't even know where to start. This is probably the 2014 movie that managed to have a great box office, and be the worst movie of 2014. Don't expect anything of this movie. All you should expect is, bad acting, bad movie editing, bad cinematography, bad everything. The storyline escalates too quickly and yet the film is boring. The dialogs are terrible and honestly if you want to see something related to this genre, just open your google browser and search for porn. There is absolutely nothing special happening in the movie. 2 stars out of 10.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Sex may sell but a story helps..,I don't fault the actors who had to perform to this script which was void of anything meaningful or redeeming. The only saving grace was the likability of the actress playing Anastasia. She had potential which was wasted in this movie.Sex is one thing embedded in a good story it can even add some interest. This is not.How this book was ever so widely read is beyond me. To make a movie out of this crap was really bad decision making by the studio exec who approved it.All this movie was is soft porn. Like a porn movie it had no plot or story line. Skip it and find a real story to watch.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Ashamed.,"This movie is just an insult on the whole human race... especially to our women. I apologize to women around the world, rest assured that there are plenty of men out there that don't treat women like this in REAL life and actually respect them as the important mothers, sisters and daughters that they are in our societies. Only reason why I rated it 2 and not 1 is it made me realize how not to ever treat a women so there is something good that came out of it I guess. But overall very saddening experience... especially on valentines day??? Buzz kill. #whereistheloveI think we need to start being way more strict on Hollywood because most movies making it to the big screen are really poor efforts at being artistic. Most of them don't even convey important messages anymore! This movie in particular! Who funds this garbage anyway! Seriously cannot remember the last time I watched a movie and it left me thinking about it for longer than 10 seconds afterwards...5 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,The problem is... it's boring,"I must say that having not yet ventured into any sexual activity, let alone BDSM, I went into this movie for the mere curiosity surrounding it. And much like the Twilight movies, I found myself bored and unpleased. Basically this movie is about nothing, and not in the good Seinfeld way. To tell you the truth, the only parts with some actual excitement to them were the more spicy ones. It's nothing too extreme, but still sexy in a small way. While the movie does have some good set decoration and wardrobe, that's about all the redeeming qualities about it. The leads share little chemistry, the dialog is awful and the script is about as pointless as it gets. Let's be honest here, I know this is for the ladies looking to see their fantasies on screen and I don't condone that. Still it's clear that apart from those ""bold scenes"", there isn't much more to this movie and its future sequels.Rating: 1/103 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,No Shades of Humanity,"So I finished watching the dreaded - and dreadful - Fifty Shades of Grey. It really was a struggle to get through this movie. I only read part of the first book and thought it was problematic due to the Domestic Abuse that happens throughout the story. Although it has been somewhat toned down for the movie, it still remains the same.I'll go through the Pros first. The cinematography, wardrobe, lighting, set direction, and soundtrack (with the exception of Ellie Goulding) was top notch. However, the old adage, ""You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"" really is true in this case. Everything was very sleek, modern, and sophisticated, almost sterile, recalling Mickey Rourke's office and apartment in 9 1/2 Weeks, but on Steroids.The Cons are everything else. Dakota Johnson's acting was probably the closest to being the most competent out of everyone and she seemed close to being human in the few moments where she asserted herself and stood up to Grey (which I wish there were more of). She did have little bits of humor I thought were cute. Otherwise, she constantly bit her lip (the Ana character also does this a lot in the book), which was annoying. Once or twice would have been okay, but it was distracting. She constantly had this sickly, unhealthy look in her eyes and face. She is supposed to be vulnerable, but there's a difference between vulnerable and just plain weak - she was definitely the latter, whether consciously or unconsciously.Jamie Dornan fared less well. His Irish accent slipped out a few times and he seemed like he was reading through his lines instead of truly emoting or becoming Christian Grey. Not that Christian Grey is a human enough character anyway, or anyone else in this film, for that matter. My biggest problem with this film (other than the Domestic Abuse) is none of the characters seem real or true to life. The dialogue was weak, awkward, and stilted. It did not flow naturally like real dialogue is supposed to sound. Everyone, including the lead actress (although she was the most ""human""), was very two-dimensional. When you watch a film, you want to feel like you're going through the character's emotions and struggles, you want the couple to get together, to overcome their problems and obstacles. That just wasn't here in this film. I struggled to make sense of why these two people even get together in the first place. In real life, I would've gotten a restraining order on this guy, no matter how ""hot"" or rich he is. There are several instances in which stalking takes place. She asks for space constantly and he never gives it to her. I could go on, but you get the (twisted) picture.As far as the sex itself (which is what many people have raised a fuss about), it's nothing to write home about, although it was tastefully presented. This movie is surprisingly vanilla for a hot-button topic like BDSM. You will not see real BDSM in this film. I would suggest seeing a classic erotic film like The Story of O, 9 1/2 Weeks, Belle du Jour, or something more recent like Secretary. I have seen more explicit sex watching Cinemax at 1:30 in the morning. It was nothing groundbreaking. The sex scenes seemed more like music videos than anything. Ana doesn't even have an orgasm. For a movie that was made and produced by women, it seriously shows a lack of demonstrating to women how female pleasure should be presented on the screen.Much has been made of the lack of chemistry between Johnson and Dornan. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I have seen lots of cinematic on-screen couples with far more heat. There were moments when there is an obvious lack of chemistry such as the scene where a photographer takes their picture at Ana's graduation ceremony. When the same picture shows up in a copy of a newspaper later on in the film, it is obvious the two clearly dislike each other (on and off the screen).Honestly, this movie was very depressing and although I made fun of it in the beginning, toward the end I felt uncomfortable and disturbed. Even though I didn't pay for it, I felt guilty that I even watched it, even out of curiosity. This is not empowering to women and it is not a relationship anyone should aspire to. Yes, I realize it was a fantasy that E.L. James created based on Twilight fan fiction. Of course you must have a suspension of disbelief whenever you watch any film, but in this case I could not. Money and power does not excuse the fact that abusive relationships can and do exist. Real life Anas haven't been so lucky. Many of them end up in shelters, on the run and in hiding, or dead.Does this mean anything in this movie could cause people to abuse others? Not necessarily, no. But if anything else I hope something like this starts a discussion about how we should help Domestic Abuse and Domestic Violence victims get on the road to living a better life. I hope women realize a relationship with a controlling man, no matter how materially generous of physically attractive he may be, is destructive and unhealthy. I hope this inspires other filmmakers out there to make better films that show sexuality in the context of a healthy, happy relationship. That's what I hope people get out of this above all else.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Not worth money,"Look, the books were badly written in the first place so adapting this to the big screen was a bad idea from the get go...... However if you have read anything about the author, she based 50 on Twilight. She had read those books and thought what if we took Bella and Edward and changed the situation to be different. She did just that. Even the author agrees that the books are badly written. She says that she is normally more disciplined. Also as someone in the BDSM lifestyle, everything is so wrong about what is done. The playroom is awesome though but for instance the knot tying around her wrists is done with a very lazy knot that is not secure and can tighten done to easily cutting of blood flow. This movie is just wrong on so many levels....In reading it I could overlook certain things but seeing it on screen...well yeah..4 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 shades of grey- a junk,"I saw the film very late. But it's so terrible that I decided to pin down a few things about the film.The foremost problem. No character arcs, hence no intense emotional depths in characters, plots or scenes.Poor Poor writing. Is this a Hollywood so called erotic film? A virgin girl intimidated by a young rich guy falls for him and eventually want her to be whipped. Ridiculous! Okay, but are there any scenes to prepare our consciousness for that? The way of Dakota's breaking dialogues really made me frustrating. No symbols used. Poor directing for that matter of fact.Okay except Dakota's good figure, even whipping is undramatic and boring. The guy's character is confused. I really didn't read his mind and real motives. A bad film.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A waste of my precious time,"I watched the movie because of the marketing power of the book. I had an idea of what the theme was. I have to say that I liked the actors and I felt connected to them at moments. However, I believe the topic of the movie was absolutely ridiculous, the characters were laughable, and the end of the movie is as useless as the thousands of times I saw the main actress naked. Clearly our society is in decadence.I liked the cinematography and the scenarios. Audi did great advertisement for sure.Many of the audience last night were disappointed one way or the other. Some of them were disappointed because of the movie itself, others because of the book vs the movie, others because of the characters, others because of the end.I'm impress how the power of marketing have achieved that people like me watch a movie like that.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fremdsch√§men at its very best!,"Boy, boy, boy. I don't know where to begin with this one.Okay. So, did I expect much? Nope. Because I (kinda) read the 1st book of this glamorous series called ""Fifty Shades"" by one E.L. James. Morbid curiosity got the better of me... ""Kinda"" because I was very much unable to finish even the first book. To even get to the 50% mark.But. I told myself that the movie had to be better. Firstly, because of Jamie Dornan, an actor who crossed my radar way before that whole train wreck of a film (and book). I really liked him. (Still do, although I hope that he won't be branded too much by the whole ""Christian Grey"" affair.) Secondly, the movie had to be better because a film couldn't possibly contain all these god-awful and painfully cringeworthy ramblings and inner monologues of one Anastasia Steele... those of her ""subconscious"" or her beloved ""inner goddess"". That brings me to thirdly (and lastly): because the script could only be an improvement of E.L. James' writing, or so I thought.Well, to be totally fair, the film actually manages to not be as dreadful as the book it's based on. Kudos for that. But that doesn't mean it was good in any sense of the word. Far from it.The film (same as the book) is a series of scenes of ""Fremdsch√§men"" strung together, to say the least. ""The cringeworthy"" simply never stops. The extremely cringeworthy dialogues between Christian and Ana. (Oh man, are they ever not?) The cringeworthy way Cristian Grey's stalking behaviour (and behaviour in general) gets romanticised. The cringeworthy (and wrong) portrayal of BDSM and people being into more, let's call it colorful sex. People taking home the message that Christian's general behaviour is okay because ""he's a Dom"" doesn't make it any better.It's funny (or not), how Christian always says ¬ÑThat's not something I know"", ¬ÑThis is who I am"", ¬ÑThat's not how I do it"", ¬ÑYou'll like it"", and at the very same time, while arguing that he doesn't know any other way, he's trying to impose his lifestyle on Ana. A lifestyle that she knows nothing about, that is obviously very alien to her. And is not at all ""the way how she does it"" or ¬Ñwho she is"". But ¬Ñshe'll like it"", it's for her pleasure after all, according to Christian, who, strangely enough, never once considers that Ana won't, in fact, like it. The thing is, Ana is clearly not very keen or enthusiastic about the whole BDSM idea, about playing the role of being submissive (because she is only that, playing a role, or trying to, as opposed to actually being submissive). Of course in the wonderfully world fantasised by one E.L. James, she'll either learn to love it later on (in the sequels). Because of him, Christian (imagine lovey-dovey eyes). Magic d*ck, come quick. Or, Ana will cure poor Christian of his bad, bad deviancy. Because looove. Either way, both are a total bag of utter nonsense, or, you know, cr...p.Oh, and don't get me started on the ""reason"" for Christian's deviant preferences. Because clearly, the only possible explanation for this kind of sexual deviance, for straying from the norm and liking BDSM and/or other fetishes has to be, gasp, an abusive childhood. Wow. Way to go, Mrs. James. Really. Chapeau. (No, wait. Are you bloody serious? ....)The only redeeming quality of the characters in the film is that Ana doesn't come across as the total blubbering, naive and insecure virgin that she is in the book. Emphasis on total.Also, what I don't get is (some) people being shocked at the degree of nudity in this film. Seriously? This is a film based on erotica, an erotic novel, or an erotic romance book in the very least. And it's (or wants to be) about BDSM ‚Äì a sex fetish. So (kinky) sex scenes and nudity are to be expected. Come on.Well, to come to an end here: compared to the source material, this is practically a master piece. The acting is okay, as far as that is even possible considering what the actors have to work with. But compared to other films, I'm sorry to say, this was a disaster. On all counts. Ultimately, even the best actors (and writers) couldn't turn this into a grand film without throwing away the piece of rubbish that the book is and completely rewriting the story from scratch. I guess, you simply can't turn sh!!t to gold... I'm still amazed how they managed to fill two whole hours with barely anything happening.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,All for nothing.,"What can I say, another director who cares more about making the money, rather than actually making a decent film. If your going to make a movie based on a controversial book, then go the whole 9 yards with it, Don't just tip toe around the topic. That's the feeling I got from this film, If anything; a couple more cuts here or there it could possibly of been a 15. I think that's the certificate the director was secretly going for (More money, more viewers) but realised that was not going to happen. Other reviewers have touched on the Twilight series comparison, I have to agree it's going down that route. To summarise; another poor adaptation which will leave many fans of the book, scratching their heads, thinking: was that it!5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Terrible,"Please b careful if u want not to spoil your own imagination.The book was too good abut the movie was awful.Mr. Grey isn't that Grey that you imagined for an entire year...Ana is too...how should I say?Too much of a dominator!All the action of the movie is based on what Ana looks and physically does...nothing interior/nothing from her mind,no interior voice,no goddess,nothing that could make u understand how and why she is attracted by Mr. Grey. This movie is why women shouldn't create erotic movies. I was completed disappointed by the script.The only good thing about it was the music... If there will be another ""50 shades"" movie in the future I'll consider watching a cartoon instead, that would be more interesting. I don't understand why would someone destroy such an awesome book!Sorry for my mistakes but I just came from the cinema and I'm so angry that I made myself an account to write this review, on an awful movie!Such a waste of time...this movie!

Fifty Shades of Grey,Make your decision,"I WOULDN'T go and see 50 shades of Grey in the cinema. I read the book years ago and it seemed interesting, so it made me want to see the film version. While watching the film I started to get bored and felt like the film was starting to drag (even though it is 2 hours long). There was a big hype about the film for about 2 years but it isn't what they make it out to be. If you want to watch 50 shades of Grey just watch the trailer all the good parts are in the trailer the rest of the film isn't very interesting. You may think I am being a prude but I am only young so I didn't care about the naked scenes if anything it spiced up the film and this is what makes people want to watch the film, women want to see Jamie Dornan naked if that is why you want watch the movie go ahead otherwise I wouldn't waste my money like other people are complaining about.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Lots of beating around the bush before the beating about the bush.,"Words can't describe how miserably awful this is.It resembles the sort of demonstration to film students about how to NOT make a film. The casting must have seemed OK at the time (good looking leads are a requirement),but there was absolutely nothing that the actors could do with a script which makes a Mills&Boon novella seem like Shakespeare.Just horribly dull, insipid and mind-numbingly boring.How on earth you can make S&M seem boring is beyond me, but this film succeeds with flying colours.If anyone gets sexually excited about this rubbish then good for them, but my girlfriend and I sat through the entire thing with an expression of dumb stupefaction that lasted for at least 20 minutes after we left the cinema.And there I was hoping for a decent bit of rumpy-pumpy afterwards, which was not to be.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Shallow and empty.,"On of those films that you eagerly sit through waiting for the ''good part'' to start and then it ends and you get nothing, no thrill, no suspense, no emotions. Empty. One of the worst endings i have seen in my life, seriously how did the people behind this movie decide to make the ending that way? This movie was anticipated to be extremely controversial and over the top in many ways, i for one did not witness any of those.The premise was kind of interesting and the first half of the film was not as bad, i was actually thinking - wow, maybe this is not going to be as horrible as almost every reviewer here have deemed, unfortunately they were right and the second part and the ending just affirmed my low expectations for this movie. The biggest problem was that the movie did not ''grow'' as the time passed, it just stayed the same throughout, hence it wasn't enjoyable. Also the songs and soundtracks chosen for various scenes were just horrible and didn't fit at all with what was happening at the time.Some people dislike the movie, because, in their opinion, it is derogatory towards women and since it is a widely known mainstream movie it reaches out to many people, it could harm the relationships of men and women, ehh just some classic feminist ranting, i simply disliked this film, since everything was off as i stated above and i did not find this controversial or shocking in any way. The only emotion i had during this film was boredom, because of its linear plot and slow pace.I only wanted to watch this, because from what i had heard, the over-whelming majority of women really liked it, however the majority of men i know thought it was thrash. In my opinion, this is due to the fact that women really enjoyed seeing a normal woman being put on a ''pedestal'' by a very wealthy and handsome young man, who can give her everything in exchange for sexual pleasure, despite that casual women don't usually like bdsm, they were ready to put that aside just to care for the sad and love seeking woman. Men on the other hand, although, on paper this should be a movie most men would love, disliked it, because it just did not meet their expectations, just like it was in my case. Lets get real for a second. Nobody wants to sit through two hours of nothingness just see a couple of poorly thought through sex scenes, which were promised to be super controversial. Men just rather watch regular porn, i would get if it would have something else to, interesting plot, etc., but unfortunately there was just that.Is worth watching it? No.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Should be renamed ""Fifty Shades of Boring""","I didn't read the book. Prior to seeing the movie, I only saw trailers and briefly heard about the movie from news and others. The movie was what I expected in terms of story. But the acting was lackluster from everyone. The directing was minimally acceptable. I almost fell asleep a couple of times. I think the hype was mostly because someone wanted to tell a story of the taboo S&M sexual practices. So it was supposed to be ""racy, daring and different"". Apparently I missed the memo on how bad it was since I saw it on opening day and the theater was about 15% full. It's sad that I'll never get this two hours and three minutes out of my life back. But there apparently will be more Grey movies as there are three books in the series.

Fifty Shades of Grey,The Screenwriter Killed the Essence of The Book.,"I didn't go in expecting an Academy Award winning movie, but after hearing how much EL James fought to keep the movie as close to the books, I was disappointed with what they came up with. No... didn't need more sex scenes, but definitely could have added another 1/2 hr to develop the storyline and other characters in the movie. Books were definitely much better. Movie cut out way too much that helped create and develop the emotional attachment and chemistry I felt while reading the books. Storyline was too disconnected and rushed, and some parts out of sequence from the book. Friendships Anastasia has between her friends and Christian's body guard weren't developed enough either. Plus they make his body guard just seem like a chauffeur in the movie.If you didn't read the books, you wouldn't understand the significance of when he says ""Laters Baby"" and when she says ""Yes Sir"". For example, in the books, Christian & Anastasia ' s emails back and forth were written a bit more formal with subject lines that were fun and teasing each other back and forth. . And always signed off by Christian with ""Laters Baby"". Both big phrases that became key to the books so much that you could buy t-shirts and other stuff with the phrases on it after the books came out. But in the movie, they're just words that wouldn't make sense if you didn't read the books. Book one wasn't my favorite though. Boring compared to the other 2. So I'm hoping the next 2 movies will be better written and more connection with the characters.Hopefully they will hire a screenwriter & director who read all the books and knows what needs to be left in the story line.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Awkward movie,"This movie has motivated me to register at this web page. The movie is just nothing. There is no truly emotionally developing story in it or sexuality. I personally got annoyed and irritated by Anna's non stop biting lip and breasts. It feels like movie consisted of these two elements interleaved by some action. The scene of her ""first sex"" did not differ much from any other ""sex"" scene in the movie. And not like I am demanding porno, it would certainly possible to express the excitement and passion much better, even without constantly showing her boobs (which are not even that great). After this movie all I wanted is to visit Seattle.5 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Zero eroticism,"OK, let's be honest. Everyone who had read the book (myself included) knew that it wasn't the most amazing piece of literature. The story has been told a million times in all the possible versions, the only new thing and the reason it got so much attention, was the ""singularity"" of the sex scenes. Now, that was the book. When you move to the screen however, you know that it's not possible to reproduce the effect of the book- as most of the book consists of Anastasia's thoughts and feelings- and of course it wouldn't be possible to depict what is described in the book. So, what I expected to watch - after so much waiting and speculation about the cast- was at least chemistry and tension between Johnson and Dornan. But there wasn't such a thing. Not even the slightest amount of it. The first thirty minutes of the film I was waiting to see magic happen, well it didn't. The rest of the film I just felt uneasy- that's the only sentiment communicated by the actors. It is definitely not worth watching.The acting is indifferent and falls flat. The only element of the film that lived up to my expectations was the soundtrack other than that, I don't think that it even remotely deserves to be called a ""romantic"" drama.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Dreadful,"In all honesty, I was not expecting much of this movie but after watching it, I must add that it was worse than I expected.I have bought the book out of curiosity like many people and didn't like it either.The main problem with the movie itself is that the actors are terrible. Dakota Johnson is slightly better than Jamie Dornan but sill pretty bad.There was something seriously wrong with the cast choice...Jamie and Dakota have zero on-screen chemistry in my opinion and everything about their relationship seemed incredibly forced and predictable. Their ""romantic""adventures are just as exciting as watching a freshly painted wall dry.The other major problem with the movie was that the lines were a mere copy-paste from the book. There was no creativity or imagination when it came to transforming the book into a movie. The line 'Laters,baby' was by far the worst. It was so unnatural that it made it look like the actor was actually reading the script right there rather than acting. The only reason why this movie is selling out theatres around the globe is because people are curious and have no idea how bad it actually is. When the movie was finally over and the lights were on again,everyone in the room was laughing and commenting on about how much of a joke it had all been.Having just said this, I only regret that this is a trilogy and that we're going to have to go through two more films (well, not me anyway,because I won't waste another penny on this). That my friends, is pure torture.",1

Fifty Shades of Grey,Like a car crash!!,"Well....I didn't expect much. I read the books more than two years ago. (Yes, the writing was bad, as well as the storyline etc.) However I kinda liked it-THEN, because don't we all love fairy tales. Don't we (women) all want a guy who whoos us away and all that?!? Yes Christian introduced her into BDSM, so what. Yes that contract thing was totally ridiculous, so what. But I think a lot of women lost themselves in the story and dreamt of Christian and imagined him and the way things happened in our own way....BUT..seeing it on screen,realizing that there is no difference between 50 Shades of Grey and a cheap, lousy sex movie, apart from ""in that cheap, lousy sex movie there is actually stuff going on"" made me feel sooooo bad, because that book became real on screen and it showed me HOW BAD IT ACTUALLY IS!!! How bad the movie is and how bad the books are. And don't let me get started on the acting! Jamie...a piece of wood, Dakota...not good either! This cast...is soo bad!! But then, how could they have been anyhow, if everyone and their mom would have picked someone else anyway! And i believe that no actor would have been able to make this work...because in the end 50 Shades of Grey does not belong on screen! It's simply rubbish!!! I can't think of one good thing in that film..wait let me think...mmmhhh...the soundtrack probably, I guess.But then, there's always the film industry...and with this movie/book will happened what happened before....with ""Lord of the Rings"" (good movie), ""Twiliight"" , ""Hunger Games""(good movie)...they will drag it out and torture us with two more sequels, although the critics say otherwise! But because there are so many people watching this movie (you, me, him, she, your neighbour....), they will make enough money to do so! And people will go and watch it..not because it's a good movie, or story, or the sex is good--NO, because this movie is like a car crash..you can't look away!! So the only thing is not to go and watch it, so that they can't make enough money for a sequel! But I guess that ship has sailed!",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,So How Grey are you?...,"The only thing in life that is non-refundable is time. So please do not spend 2 hours of your life on this movie. This is my first review. I thought about writing this review 30 minutes into the movie. I have decided to see it on the Valentine's Day surrounded by couples who expected to see intense, sexy scenes which would probably ""warm them up"" before a romantic night. I have not read the book, but I saw multiple girls reading it on the tube, so I though it must be good right?After the movie ended people in the cinema were looking at each other and you can hear them asking ""That's it???."" Yep, that's it. I have watched many erotic movies that have much better plot. It is not a cinema movie, it is a poorly written television film with a big budget. The acting was quite good and I do feel sorry for the actors, because they had to play somehow with very poorly written script. The movie is just senseless and does not deliver what it was supposed to deliver! The sex scenes were supposed to have a shock factor, engage us and make us reflect on our sexuality. But sorry, handcuffs or spanking is nothing new or shocking in today's sex culture. I bet half of the people sitting with me in the audience enjoy much more intense sex life. This movie was as if it was targeting teenagers ( if I was 16 I would have probably enjoyed it), the paradox is that at 16 you probably would not be allowed to see it. The movie tried to show that some women like their men being dominating during sex but why to waste 2 hours of someone's life to state the obvious...",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,don't waste your money on this film,"Well first of all I have to say - I've read the books. And I never really understood the hysteria about ""how bad it is, and how desperate someone should be to read it""... I wondered how someone could read 100 of pages that he/she doesn't like at all?!Just to be ctitical? for me it was in fact an art of easy going novel, a simple story, which makes me wind down. It was not at all a ""piece of excellent literature"". But as I remember the author never said such things either... However I liked the atmosphere, the way it was represented. Of course there are a lot of passages I've just skipped, but all in all it was a relaxing book. Therefore I was quite curious about the film... and I was highly disappointed. At not a moment I was caught by the action. The actors didn't managed to reproduce the tingly atmosphere. Especially Christian Grey is an absolute miscast, Jamie Dorman never ever has this necessary charisma and attitude. Dakota Johnson makes it better, for her and the soundtrack the second star. In conclusion - if there comes a movie sequel I will stay away.9 out of 19 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Atrociously bad,"Fifty Shades of Grey more like Fifty Shades of Abuse.The story is about a literature student, interviews the wealthy, intimidating Christian Grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man. Grey is likewise drawn to Ana - but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms. Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect.Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a clich√© now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking ""That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of sh't makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away"". And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought.Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell.Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a ass-hole and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back.The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad.Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I hated it, I hated it. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Poor,"Let me start by saying that I've never read the books, my girlfriend has and I haven't seen her so excited to see a movie for a long time, so I went along with her to see it with an open mind.Put simply, it's a poor film. Poorly written with some really poor acting. The two lead characters are wooden with no real chemistry, I'd guess they were working within the confines of a pretty poor script so I'll let them and the director off a little, but this was still reminiscent of a low- budget B movie.It's beyond my understanding what people can see in this movie, maybe the book was better, maybe not, I'll never know... Unless all the women I know secretly want to be tied up and flogged I don't get the attraction or the point of the film.My guess is that even the people who are genuinely into BDSM are going to think this film is a terrible reflection of their way of life, the feminists will be jumping all over it (Although, in my opinion, there's nothing in it that's degrading to women. To each his/her own, if 2 consenting adults want to experiment, what right does anyone have to judge them?), the poor blokes who got dragged along to see it are going to slate it (me...) but the hundreds of thousands of fan-girls/women will still flock to see it in droves and ensure that the film makes a ton of money, the sequels get made and Valentines day gets ruined for another couple of years.Having said all that, my girlfriend enjoyed it, so each to their own I guess.For me the only reason it gets 2 stars is for the soundtrack, which was excellent.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Thumbs Down,I saw the previews and thought that this movie was going to be better then what it really was.. I am a big fan of 50 Shades as i have read all 3 books.. And this movie wasn't as good as i thought it was going to be. The main characters seemed so awkward around each other especially Ana.. And it just went by so slow. It took about an hour and a half just to get into their real relationship and the sex.. Just not what i expected..Also they missed a lot of things and after the hour and a half it went by socfast i was confused..And waiting impatiently for the movie to end.8 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Wow, this movie is bad","So I watched this movie last night, and I felt the need to sign up to write a review, I have seen many movies so far in my short time on this earth, but let me just say, that this has to be in the ""bottom 10 movies of all time"" list.I had a fair idea what the movie was about, my wife really enjoyed the books and I went in with an open mind. The beginning of the movie is so rushed, so much happens in such a short time, and the relationship is catapulted from infancy to a much deeper relationship in a ridiculously short and very forced space of time.What I find even harder to comes to terms with are the characters, you are never made to feel any sort of connection with them, and they are hard to relate to. perhaps woman find themselves connected emotionally to Anastasia because of the whole ""average girl, average life, which takes a twist"" fantasy. But as a Man, I cant relate to a Wealthy, Conflicted, Dark entrepreneur with a BDSM fetish. But in the same breath, Grey is the only character in the movie with depth, and the only character anyone is really interested in.I am sorry to say but Anastasia is boring, no one really cares about her, I don't think? and if you do, why do you? she is average, with a normal boring life, she lacks substance, I don't want to get to know her, why would I?Overall the movie warms up, very, very slightly around half way through but soon takes is right back to the rather silly sexual relationship that, again, at risk of sounded like a stuck record, lacks substance.In conclusion, this movie is very hollow. The acting was questionable and the actors had no chemistry, and seemed to force a connection every time required.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Terrible, terrible film.",This film isn't sexy or risky. They have taken an R rated book and turned it into a M15 lifeless exercise in boredom.There is zero chemistry between the two main characters The sex scenes are so tame that it leaves little point to the rest of the story as it was very thin to begin with.Because of the M15 rating rather than R as it should have been it means that all the sex scenes have really choppy editing as they couldn't show any full frontal nudity. It also meant that when there is spanking done they can't actually show her being hit.Please don't make the next two books into films as I really don't want to have my next two valentines day evenings wasted with drivel like this.11 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Worst Adaptation - Lame Christian - Very Good Ana,"OK, the book's writing was poor but the story was good, and it did have its erotic moments. However, the script was the absolute worst part of the film - it was AWFUL. There was poor story development with horrible pacing in script and direction. I was not a fan of Dakota Johnson's casting as Ana, but she was very good. The emotions that moved across her face were exactly as I had pictured Anastasia. Jamie Dornan was as sexy as a dry stick of wood. This was horrible casting for Christian. He did not have any chemistry with Dakota, and I can't imagine chemistry with anyone. I did expect the sex scenes to be somewhat erotic. They were not; I felt that they were mechanical, almost with no context. If the sequels are being made, Christian needs to be recast and a real writer found. I didn't expect much from this film and was not disappointed.12 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Grey Movie -.-,"So, I went to watch the movie and I don't have words enough to tell how the movie was so bad!! The fans were expecting some good. I entered the movie so happy and excited because I actually liked the book and I was looking forward to watch it but the moment I got to the movie and by the moment it began, I was disappointed. Like seriously why would you cut almost half of the book?! What happened??? The book is one thing and the movie is something almost way different. The movie is just about other things. On the first book it has good things too but in the movie it doesn't mention!! And also since so many parts were taken out, people who didn't read the book, they won't understand the movie! To be honest, it could be something way better if you based it on the book! I'm such a fan of the book. By the time I got out of the movie, I got really sad and angry and I just felt like breaking everything. To be honest, you really failed at the movie ;)12 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,50 Shades of Grey: more pain than any dominant would ever ask,"It is apparent that the director and the writer of 50 Shades of Grey have never been anywhere near a Dom/sub relationship in their life, let alone be authoritarian enough to make a film about one. As a person who has been both a dominant and a submissive I am appalled that this film even pretends to discuss the envelope this world is seeded in. From the wildly unbelievable characters, and their increasingly irritable incomprehension of each other to the childish explanations for such relationships and complete lack of integrity in any scene presented makes 50 Shades of Grey about 51 points from even coming close to being a 101 on Dom/Sub relations.This film is nothing more than a conservative judgment call and an attack on a world that they clearly demonstrated they know absolutely nothing about the fundamentals of, let alone any whipper of insight.One star out of five... And only barely that. My recommendation would be Secretary or even Nymphomaniac.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,"This film simply does not work, it's really really bad.","So I went into the film with an open mind but this was not good. The acting was really bad and the story was boring.To be fair,Pros: this a slick and polished production. The soundtrack is solid and the editing is great. With a great cast and an actual professional screenplay, you'd be onto something.I never thought I'd be so bored during an r-rated flick about sadomasochism.This is an example of one of those movies that are whipped up with the sole purpose of creating an artificial media phenomenon. This didn't work.This is just a talentless ploy for money, from the director to the cast.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,First time I've left home to watch porn,"I only decided to see this after the initial reviews, I simply could not believe it was as bad as everyone made it out to be. Many of the reviews here are similar in grammar and tone, I was starting to think it was some kind of conspiracy. I actually believed there was some kind of anti-fifty shades of grey movement happening on the internet. Shockingly, I was completely wrong.How to sum this movie up... pretty much everything that has been said here is true. The acting and plot outside of sex scenes absolutely plays out like the stuff you would see in softcore porn. Clich√© after clich√© right down to the core, I really can't stress enough how awkward and downright tacky some of the lines, or even reactions in the movie play out. While reading reviews here, I saw the phrase ""sophomoric writing"" pop up many times, now I understand why.The totally out of place and blatant lip biting, the ludicrous thirst showcased by Anastasia from the very first interaction with Grey is completely out of character and unbelievable for the type of person she is supposed to represent. Half of what she says reads and sounds like lines someone as awkward as her would come up with an hour later in the shower (alone). Christian's character has his owned forced one-liners that are obviously a service to book readers, I won't even bother with it because it has been covered extensively in other reviews. All I can say is I would be in for a few years worth of spankings after all the eye-rolling I did through this movie.I am convinced the writer's views on romance and courtship have never surpassed the preconceptions developed during her teenage years, when everyone dreamed of being swept away by a mysterious figure with the potential to make all their material dreams come true. This movie is nothing more than a fan service, and I would expect no one but avid readers of the book to enjoy or even be able to take it seriously. The music was okay though, so 2/10..... still a better love-story than twilight?",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Weird,"I knew what I was getting myself into going to see this film I don't know what I expected but it definitely wasn't this. The film has no romance in it at all the whole film is literally just awkward, awkward to watch, awkward scenes just awkward everything. Really isn't much to say certain scenes I found were pleasurable but then other scenes were so dull and the film really was just centred around trying to get the most almost porn scenes in. There's no really exciting story, honestly I went just for the hype that everyone was going and when I went the cinema I literally struggled to find a seat I found myself laughing most of the time watching the film because literally everyone in the theatre seemed to find it funny. For advice don't listen to the hype don't see this film. Boringggggggg!16 out of 33 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,A hype over nothing,The first and most important thing I can say is I wouldn't be proud to say I produced this film. Although the acting was faultless the content of the film was awful. There are big chunks of the book that are missing and I left the cinema feeling let down. As someone who enjoyed the books I would advise reading them rather than watching the film. Dakota Johnson's performance is amazing and she fits the role of Miss Steele well but the production let her down. I am guessing that a squeal is on the cards as there is a lot of content that is not explained. Definitely would not recommend paying cinema prices to watch this film because I regret doing it myself.14 out of 28 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of B.S.,"Quickie Review:Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a naive literature student, who goes to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). They both are instantly attracted to each other. However, Anastasia's life is changed forever as she enters Christian's luxurious and sexual world. Fifty Shades of Grey is horrible. A soft-core porn masquerading itself as something more. Laughable dialog and shallow caricatures, although plentiful are the least of its problems. Avoid this movie at all cost, please don't support such horrid excuse for a film.Full Review:I understand the appeal of exploring sexual fantasies. Considering the world-wide sensation that was the novel, there is a lot of curiosity to know what all the fuss is about. That curiosity is what got me to go to the cinema to check it out. I really wish Doc Brown's DeLorean arrives this year so I can stop the past me from making this terrible mistake.I am not an unreasonable guy, so I'll start with the positives. The cinematography is done well, it looks good. However, polish a turd as much as you want, in the end it's still a turd.There are two reactions you will have to the dialog: laughter at its absurdity or cringing at its awkwardness. There is no flow to what's being said. They'd be sitting at a dinner table having a conversation and out of nowhere Anastasia will say ""will you make love to me now?"" I instantly thought of Ron Burgundy's meme of That Escalated Quickly. Little did I know I should have saved that meme thought for the immediate gem of a line from Christian ""I don't make love, I f***."" Well at least he gets right to his point. What teenager wrote this script? It makes Twilight feel like Shakespeare.Now let's talk about the caricatures, yes caricatures because these aren't characters. Christian only has one mood setting, deeply brooding. The only other way to describe him is, rich. On the other hand, Anastasia is desperately made to look like a simple innocent small town girl. Oh look she drives a beat up VW Beetle, oh she's from a small town in Georgia, oh she doesn't own computer, oh she still uses a flip phone from her middle school, oh she doesn't have fancy clothes. We get it! Move on.If you are thinking I am looking too into this, and that all I have mentioned are just means to an end which are the titillating BDSM scenes, fair enough, let me address those scenes. They are simply not sexy, there is no chemistry whatsoever. Most of the time it doesn't even feel like Anastasia wants to be there. If you are looking to be shocked by the craziness of BDSM, except for the last scene it is actually quite mild. There are other movies that handle the topic of sex much better. For example, The Little Death, about taboo fantasies and how real couples deal with them, or Nymphomaniac about sex addiction and how it consumes you, or Secretary about the psychology behind BDSM.But the most insulting of all, that I can't understand how it is acceptable in the mainstream, is how weak of a ""character"" Anastasia is. The entire movie, she doesn't stand on her own. Even though she is being emotionally abused, she needs a man. Even when she is whipped and doesn't enjoy it, she is still in love with him. What did he do to deserve your love Anastasia? Oh right, new computer, new dresses, new Audi, helicopter rides, and glider rides. Simply insulting.So please, do not watch this movie. I know I've used the phrase, avoid at all cost, before for reviews of bad movies, but in this case I really mean it. If you are being dragged to see this movie, bribe your friend to not make you go. It's better use of your money anyway. I hate to rant non-stop, but for this movie I had to. If this review saves even one soul from the misery I've endured, I'll consider my life's purpose on this little rock we call Earth, complete.I was battling to rate this movie either 1 or 2 out of 10, but I opted for the higher rating. Why you ask? Because it managed to get a man in his mid-20s to complain about a movie filled with sex scenes. That's an amazing feat in itself that I must commend.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Two minor pros far outweighed by several massive cons,"Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.Have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.There are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot.On the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing.Regarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia Gay Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers.All in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Severely disappointed with Fifty Shades of Grey film.,"For the curious minds wondering how I've seen and reviewed the film already, we are in the US territory of Guam and are one day ahead. I was severely disappointed with the casting and directing. The storyline didn't even make it through the first book. It did not capture the sensuality and rawness. The only actor that came close to matching what was in my head, while reading the books, was Anna. If you've read the books, I highly doubt you will enjoy the movie. My husband had not read the books and he felt the movie was just 'ok.' Of course, he did say there were scenes he enjoyed. Christian's character has no depth and will surely leave people wondering what are the fifty shades, because this film only portrayed two of his fifty shades. Viewers will only see him as business and sex. I think they missed the mark. As the author, I'd be furious. I was ready to leave within the first five minutes.38 out of 71 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty Shades of Ney,"If you like good movies, then this is not for you. If you like movies that are so bad they are good, then this is not for you. This movie is bad. Plain and simple. I've never read the book, nor do I have any intention to ever in my life especially after this movie whom some have even said was better than the book, which means the book is horrible. I know fangirls will strongly disagree and praise the movie regardless of how terrible it is though. It's almost like people who love this movie have never had sex and seeing such badly acted love/bondage scenes on-screen makes their ovaries burst. I have seriously seen bad porn with better acting and plot development than this. Seriously. I'm not just bashing this movie to go along with the masses, it truly is an unbelievably horrible movie. The leads were just bad and not even that sexually appealing. The directing was decent, but that doesn't save the movie from its horrible script and terrible delivery. Even Martin Scorsesse couldn't turn such a horrible book into a good movie. Sadly, this movie is critic proof. No matter how horrible and honest the reviews are, the fangirls and tweens will stampede to the theater and turn this into a franchise that will probably mean the final book will get a two part movie. I love sex. I love freaky sex with a freaky sexy woman. I love porn on occasion. Aside from a sexy woman, this movie combines all of those elements in the worst way. I do give kudos to James Dornan not for his horrible acting, but his decision to join the cast. The movie may be horrendous, but you cant deny that he will become a sex symbol because of it. I give it 1 star plus 1 bonus star because one up side is that women will appreciate men in suits a lot more after this. Not that they don't already.",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty shades of Boredom !!,"There was quite a huge build up to this movie, a Valentine release based on one of best selling books of 2011, lots of sex and nudity, this movie had everything to entertain, but alas it did not. It was rather dragged, boring and utterly un-entertaining. It was really torturous sitting through the running time and it felt rather a punishment to watch this movie. It might interest the blonde-haired monkey girls whose favorite movie is ""Twilight"" but surely not to anyone with even a little bit of taste for movies.You can surely give this movie a miss, rather give this movie a miss for your peace of mind. The two leads had no attractiveness but rather seemed half-dead, especially Dakota, who seemed like a zombie taken straight out of Zombieland.P.S: Anyone planning to force start their sexual life, take your girlfriend to this movie and she will surely breakup with you.Adios !",1
Fifty Shades of Grey,Fifty shades of boredom,"Please keep in mind, I have read the books. That's not to say I liked them, I actually struggled to get through the poor writing ability of the author and the incessant use of the same adjectives over and over like there wasn't a thesaurus handy.Now, I just returned from seeing this in the theater and I must say that I wish I had waited until it was out on cable. I thought I'd give them a chance to spruce up the books a bit, but that did not happen. I was bored after about 30 minutes into it and thought of leaving halfway through.The acting was OK, but then again both stars worked with what they were given...which was not a lot of dialogue to start with. I wouldn't hang my hat on either of them. The set design was good for the most part and stayed close to the books as far as colors and layout. Other than that, there's really not a lot of positive review for this. It felt like I was watching a bad soap opera.",1

If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$",1
Joker,I feel like everyone is brain washed,"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem...

Joker,I don't get it,Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie.Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth.For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along.Very disappointed.388 out of 698 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Joker,So overrated/overhyped,Don't waste 2 hours of your life this movie is the baddest i've seen in a long time. Crappy writing and no good storyline...it was boring. I went to the pay counter to ask my money back for the 2 hours of torture...they can't do people like this. And for all the people with 10/10(the reason why i went) you're a  joke.264 out of 493 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Joker,Who's the real joker?,"I don't understand the high ratings. I went to the cinema with high expectations, only to discover that the movie was slow as anything and was almost finished before the first killing happened. It was a dreadful time having to wait for something to happen.
But yes, once the movie was finished and I finally walked out, I got the cosmic joke; I was the joker, trusting the reviews and leaving disappointed in disbelief I actually paid for watching it.276 out of 521 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,"2 hours full of bad , bad mood.","Joaqu√≠n Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes.
The world is mean and bad, and you can only be bad and hit back. Chaos, anarchy, whatever .. inspires bye a clown who killed 3 bullies.
More of this stupid excess of brutality in the name of... what?
Yes. It is the same director as in the hangover 3.

Joker,Joke's on You,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea. In the film, a band of Hollywood's most insipid producers, writers, directors and other such riffraff suffering from this ailment got together for a group therapy session, in which the therapist, a Hollywood mogul, had them 'let it all out', gathered the refuse and flogged it off for a few hundred million dollars.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers.",1
Joker,"just a joke,the movie.","I'm keeping it short, the movie sucks.Yes, I know there's a need to build character and crap, and I think it's important for any good movie.Same goes with this, I get it Joker was a troubled man, I get his frustration, but I don't need 2 hours of the movie telling me the same crap over and over again.Give the guy an Oscar for performance but throw this movie into the trash right after.226 out of 436 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,No.. Just... no.,"I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.Joker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great. More to the boring side.It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. And he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie.178 out of 355 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Overrated boring cheap pretentious movie that makes dumb people feel smarter,"People are so hyped about it because it's so pretentious, that it makes them feel like ""enlightened"" ones. I haven't heard a good review of this movie from smart or intelligent people. Only those whose main movie list consists of actions and comedies call this a piece of art.A wife of a friend even called those who hadn't liked the movie ""lemmings"" but she's the one from the countryside who dreams of expensive brands and it actually made me laugh my ass out. Now you have an idea who this movie was made for.The plot is the main weakness. The Phoenix overplays and it feels uncomfortable to watch. The camera work feels very cheap and the overall boredom of the movie makes you start noticing all the imperfections. I would give it 5-6 out of 10 but there are too many pretentious dummies who gave 10 points so I'll even out the difference.117 out of 241 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,I really don't understand.,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.",1
Joker,Overrated and overhyped,"Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than ""One flew over cuckoos nest"" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.128 out of 270 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Derivative and Uninspired,"There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material. This film is little more than a remake of ""Taxi Driver"" with elements (most notably the end) borrowed from ""Network"".
In the case of ""Taxi Driver"" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie. Except the execution isn't as polished, the acting not of the same caliber and the story not as original.Watch ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", this film was made 40 years earlier and was made better.123 out of 269 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Murdering the Joker,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.If you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did.",1

Joker,Disappointing,"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.
The script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.
As a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.
As for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.95 out of 215 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Missed opportunity,"any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this ""madness"" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it's overwhelming doesn't earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or ""inspired"" by and from other movies: Nolan's Dark knight, Scorsese's king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can't relate to is justified by ""well, it's joker! It's not suppose to make sense""Bottom line, don't think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the ""joker laugh""....lets just say, it was also poor.",1
Joker,"Unwatchable, uncomfortable, predictable trainwreck of a film.","I literally created an imdb account for the first time in order to attempt to warn people off of this terrible film. I have nothing good to say about it at all. It was a poorly crated story awkwardly told. The only saving grace is that Joaquin Phoenix acted an awful character in an awful story. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I found it to be incredibly obvious and predictable for every ""twist"" in the film. The end credits were the best part when I finally was free.

Also, this guy had to have lost a lot of weight as he showed a shockingly thin body. I will say I enjoyed the credits at the end. The yellow lettering against the black background allowed for clean clear reading of all who worked on this movie. As the only dissenter in the reviews I am sure most will believe the others.

Joker,A disturbing take on the Joker.,"The Joker for me was a disturbing and sometimes hard to watch revision of the Joker that not many of us saw coming, Phoenix brought a great effort to the table, but it was somewhat miss-placed for hysteria and mental illness. The Joker has always been known to be cunning, intelligent and calculating so I was surprised they made the Joker out to be so spontaneous and mentally unfit considering what we know he is capable of in a myriad of comics and movies. I do not see this version of the Joker outwitting Batman and the city of Gotham's authorities, he seems to be far too convoluted in the sense that people get to him mentally and emotionally far too easily, he is unstable and not intellectual. Heath Ledger's Joker was and always will be the pinnacle of the Joker, the perfect balance of humor, wit and insanity, it should go without saying. This Joker was just too weird and disturbed to be anything but a sideshow freak.64 out of 142 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,A Banal and Pointless Exercise,"If Todd Phillips wanted to spend $55 million on creating yet another pointlessly glorified, anti-hero and attempt to pass it off as a case study of a mentally ill agent being displaced by society, he could've at least spent a portion of that budget employing people who are able to contribute honest, fair, and much-needed portrayals of actual disaffected minorities in society.47 out of 101 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Chaos is not a solution,"First of all, sorry for my bad English.
Btw, I went to cinema on hype wave with mr. Phoenix's Joker (and, of course, Im big lover of Jokers portated by mr. Ledger and mr. Nicholson). But what I saw in this movie is unacceptable.In any cases Joker is handsome character but the cause of his actions is always in his mind (or in his insanity). But not here. Mr. Phoenix's Joker - is a victim on society and mr. Philips say to us that ALL bad actions that we saw in the past - is the result of society. But its can't be true!If its true, then society WANTS to have shootings in Orland, Carolina, Las Vegas, all this peoples (and childrens!) were kill by our hands. Thats what i saw in this movie. All the human's pain was produced by our hands, by my hands, but this is not true, mr. Philips. I dont want to had 9/11, i dont want to have WWII (and WW1 also). This is not my birthday wish. So you was wrong, mr. Philips, with idead of this movie.If i want to protest against the society - I will take some anti-drugs flyiers and give it to my friends or visit some schools to tell childrens that they have to care of their siblings and help their parents or tall with parents to teach children do rights things in their future. Thats will be my protest against society. But not making a chaos.Btw, good play, mr. Phoenix, very well done. Hope you will take Oskar for that.",1

Joker,Worst movie I have ever seen,"I feel like the only person who thought this movie was absolutely terrible and a complete waste of time and money.Firstly it's in no way entertaining. Every scene is an endless indulgence of people trying to be artsy but only accomplishing a boring, frustrating and pointless video of an actor being totally mental. Being completely mental is not hard to script or act, nothing needs to make sense and you don't need any element of normality - enter the joker. Acting on the spectrum is much more difficult - think Forrest Gump, I am Sam or Rain Man.So if it's not meant to be entertaining than what's the point? Just to make you uncomfortable and frustrated? Job done. But who wants to watch that? No thanks.As far as being the joker that's the most disappointing aspect of the film. The character has 0 intelligence, manipulative inclinations or ability to scheme and organise (again he's completely insane). He's also not funny. The joker from the comics is the antithesis of batman. He has no back story, he's clever and cunning and always putting things together. He runs a criminal empire and never acts alone. This joker was a loner, totally insane and gets in a fridge? Also he's far too old to be the joker, when Bruce grows up he'll be fighting an old man. So if it's not a joker origin story then what is it? A poorly scripted, weak story with an agenda to showcase an unrealistic perspective on mental illness.The story moves along at a snail's pace to make allowances for the joker to dance around looking like a fruit cake. The whole movie is uncomfortable and low resolution in its plot and motive. If this is what passes as a good movie then it's a very sad day for humanity 1/10",1
Joker,What a waste,I Have rarely been as disappointed in a movie as i have been with this one. I went in expecting a deep interesting and entertaining movie.

I was expecting something on the level with Heath Ledgers joker but it failed to gain my interest in the least.

Joker,This movie is ridiculous and has no complexities that make a movie great,"I feel the best movies are complex and make you feel a range of emotions such as love, empathy, pity, joy, hatred, etc. The joker I found to be a series of unbelievable cliches . So the joker is poor and has some menial jobs and everyone in society is mean and abusive to him including his mother. I did feel sorry for him but at the same tine it shows his mental issues probably keep him from living a normal life. I did feel empathy for his plight but I didn't feel that society would get behind him as a ""hero"" for killing 3 people randomly on a subway. Also I found it ridiculous when the mob attacked the cops as if everyone in society hates cops.

Joker,Boring like hell,"Not sure why so much hype about an ever so boring movie. Over implying the obvious is what is going on in this nonsense called Joker. Moves at a snails pace and ultimately one loses all empathy towards the main character. The whole boring drama tries to drive in the fact that the Joker is lunatic and it just never moves on.

Joker,My First Review: Hollywood is a joke,"I'm 36 now, this is my first review ever. Only because I'm sick of all of this. I don't want to sound like an old, miserable man. But Hollywood is failing on me, time and time again.Just to name a few: the last Blade Runner, the last Star Wars, Toy Story 4, Avengers Infinity War, Endgame, etcetera, etcetera. All the big ones. Disappointment after disappointment. And then there's Joker. I hoped it was the exception... But, no.Apparently, the only way to get good reviews is by hyping and trolling the media and with that, people's opinions and wallets. It's too easy, too boring, too shallow.Where are the storylines? In all of the above there is none to be found. No plot whatsoever. No rememberable scenes or quotes. Empty. Nada!It's even the opposite of a plot: all these movies just don't make any sense. These so-called 'plots' are written in meeting rooms. Bad, bad compromises that only check all the boxes for the laws of Hollywood. And people fall for it.And I just wonder if I'm the only one who thinks:
1. Joker is a joke
2. Hollywood is a joke
3. Review systems are a jokeThis makes me realize it's not just in the cinema that people let themselves be fooled. Think about elections.And this review will be trolled as well. Keep thinking for yourselves guys!",1
Joker,As grotesque as a clown's smile,"My husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown?
Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine.
Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. Something was wrong in them from the start.
Here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. Everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all. ""Why so serious ? ""asked the Ledger Joker. And that's a good question, because I'm worried about the future of this character, especially for the actors who will want to play him.
In terms of the actor's performance, that's Joaquim Phoenix pushed to the extreme all over. In all his films I remember, this actor plays social misfits, loners unable to make friends, depressive people or on the verge of a nervous breakdown, misunderstood guys, sons rejected by their fathers, rebels, etc. In short, he only plays tortured souls. He even played a guy who falls in love with his computer because he can't get along with a real girlfriend. So it's normal that he knows how to play a crazy clown. Talent? If you will, considering the fact that he seems unable to play much else.
This simplistic and gloomy depiction of society has already claimed victims. There are people who dress up as clowns and ransack everything in the streets and cinemas where the film is shown. It seems that some misfits wanted to believe that, as with the Joker, their misfortune depended on everything and everyone else. Their happiness couldn't certainly be up to themselves.
Anyway, don't believe the good things that are said about this movie. And if you feel a bit out of sorts, don't go to see it, you'll make yourself more unhappy for a film that's really not worth it.",1
Joker,Dumbest DC movie yet,"This has to be the dumbest DC movie yet. Way to miss the opportunity. First the Joker character is all wrong, this depicts Joker as unintelligent person with no wit. WRONG Joker maybe insane but his wit and intelligence is what makes him the master criminal that keeps batman on his toes. His ability to always find way out of being locked up was not demonstrated at all. The bar was set high with Joker in suicide squad and they didn't come close to the epic legend.22 out of 44 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Just creepy and weird,"This is one of the most overrated movies ever. Once again, Joaquin Phoenix's creepy weirdness totally overshadows everything else in this film. He's so desperate to make this his own character, that he makes the whole film awkwardly uncomfortable and unenjoyable to watch. I'm not sure what character he was supposed to be, but it sure wasn't the joker. He was just a creepy guy in a clown costume with extensive psychological issues.

Joker,Duh?,"Masterpiece? Are you Jokering me? Mediocre at best.
The only explanation I can come up with to explain the gushing praise of this boring film is the dumbing down of a generation by the education system and PC culture. People seem to think its some kind of brilliant social commentary.
I usually like Joaquin Phoenix, but here he plays a bland character who comes across as very dull and of low intelligence. His laugh is grating and very un-Joker like, his dialogue is stilted and uncomfortable. There is no wit, no clever dark comedy, just seriousness and depression. The Joker has always been portayed as crazy and mentally unbalanced, but never dim-witted, until now. I don't know why this character is even called the Joker. Other than having the name Arthur Fleck he seems to be an entirely different character. Its a depressing film, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, but in this case it is. Thankfully I didn't pay any money to see this one. I'm giving it one star to even out the ridiculously high rating its got. Otherwise I'd probably give it a 431 out of 66 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Irresponsible Filmmaking at its Finest,"This was irresponsible filmmaking at its finest coming at the worst possible time. Todd Phillips should be ashamed. He had the opportunity to offer a positive message to people that see themselves in Arthur's shoes- people that have been wronged by the system and see no way out- and instead he reassured them that they are monsters and the only way they can ""win"" is if they get back at the society that wronged them in any way they can. He's a cash grabber that used his platform to tell an entertaining Joker story, instead of a deeper resonate message like it could have been. From an outsider's view, one could argue that this scenario is what happens when society fails, but this was not told from an outsider's view. This was told from the terribly empathetic Arthur's view, and so I see no reason why a potential school shooter wouldn't relate to him. This is saying to that person, it's better to be infamous than a nobody. It's a very dangerous message at this current time. For those that argue, it's only art, I argue that the mainstream media is potentially the most powerful force in the entire world. Personally, I feel that with great power comes great responsibility. Media makers have the right to make whatever they want, but they have the responsibility to use the power they've been given for good and this was completely the opposite...Objective review: Beautifully shot and acted, but super boring at times.",1

Joker,Trash...,"Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix? Here is the question. Except that in my mind there is no question. 100% Heath Ledger. And here is the reason why: while Ledger was perfect comic book character, Phoenix' character is more disturbing version of Joker. He is mentally ill and seriously needs help. I don't say that Ledger's joker wasn't crazy, He was somewhat crazy but in that movie everything is done in a way that we know it's comic book movie, good versus bad and that's it. 2019 Joker is more disturbing. There is a lot of emotion put in this movie which one would say is good thing but it's done in such manner that somehow we feel sorry for character and somehow even justify his actions. Violence is never the answer. No matter how bad your life is or how many people have hurt you, it is never an option. However, the creators of this movie seem to think differently. There you can hear triumphant music playing when Joker killed all those people. Also, movie is a shock value, unoriginal and uninspiring. The Dark Knight was really interesting movie to watch, everything was somewhat coherent in there. In Joker we have a lot of dancing, laughing, killing and mental breakdowns. To sum up - it's trash.",1

Joker,Engineered Trash,"As pointed out the story reveals a cynical perspective of a pointless protagonist that does nothing except react to its own environment. This is not a story; it's engineered agony.The technical aspects might be good, but it all means nothing if the story's garbage. It's like serving garbage on a golden plate. The plate is beautiful, great craftsmanship, but the garbage is still garbage.Movies communicate ideas about human life; why did the author think this is a story worth to be told? It preaches madness as a solution for evil. It preaches that self abandonment is the new cool. This sits right there with the new Star Wars that preaches that the hero doesn't need a journey - the hero gets everything on a silver platter, with no effort at all. What a messed up lesson for life.This movie has nothing to offer.",1
Joker,INDEPENDENT DARKNESS,"Joker is an escape into a sociopathic dark drama produced as an independent film with a big budget cast. Todd Phillips wrote , produced and directed this cinematic catastrophe. Phoenix was brilliant in the portrayal of a broken-hearted villain, he simply read the script he was paid for. The concern returns to Todd Phillips. His filmography includes a variety of B movie comedies, Old School & Hangover being his claim to fame. Joker is not a comedy or an action throwback to the DC comics. Joker is a dismal depressing depiction from a director who is obviously illustrating his own internal darkness.28 out of 62 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,No Jokes,"JP is an undeniably intense actor who certainly puts his soul into what he does. Everything from the honored actor is well-made as a work of art. But now the movie is not called JP but the Joker and that is where the fun ends. A movie cannot start and end with a solo performance if everything is empty around. It is truly a totally entertaining film that lacks momentum altogether. It also deviates so much from the original that I would like to say that it is no longer a DC movie, but instead a film about a seriously ill person who only feels compassion for himself. No, even though I bought the ticket, I don't buy the movie concept.33 out of 75 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Horrible job of portraying the character,"If it wasn't for the title and make-up, you wouldn't know it was based on the comic-book character. First of all, the real Joker is not a weak and unconfident pushover. Not even in his genesis stage. The real Joker had a high tolerance for pain, could fight and was intelligent. Which made him dangerous due to his insanity. When Joaquin shoots the guy on the subway, he does it out of cowardice. They try to make up for it with the Murray shooting scene. There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal. They should have just called the movie something totally different and forget about trying to make the connection.9 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Abusive,"Characters that suffer abuse can be a good element in a plot. But audience should never suffer abuse. The audience needs to experience catharsis in the end. And this never happens with 'Joker'. The film has a huge problem, which it never manages to solve: it wants to be realistic and tell the tale of an innocent, abused individual who snaps; but it also wants to exist within a fictional universe in which this man is as much of an abuser as he is a victim. And this creates problems for the screenwriters that they never manage to solve. Thus Joker comes across as a sympathetic character first, but turns to a vicious killer towards the end, at which point everyone becomes confused, and stops liking him. There is no redemption of any kind, no satisfying emotional resolution, only a brutal ending which serves the purposes of the wider franchise and doesn't deliver on its own terms. In the end, the character we were made to empathize with becomes nothing but a caricature in a silly superhero universe. And that is an insult to anyone who invested in the character from the beginning. The audience is cheated. Also, one should note the disturbing anarchist/communist vibe in the film - the idea that it's better to burn down the world than allow their particular understanding of 'injustice' to go on. I may pity Joker and hate the cynical Wayne, but I won't put degenerate, mentally ill clown in charge of an angry mob that wants to burn everything down.",1

Joker,A MASTERPIECE,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is different. He is over acting some times. Phoenix is not being true to the character. He is what he is because what he experienced. The childhood trauma and the time he spend in the asylum. If He is out in the society because he is fit to do so. The seven medication doesn't seem to have a bit of effect on him.After the metro incident he is breaking a chain to free himself from what the society need him to be. There is no change in his ways. The character didn't evolve. He is same at the beginning and at the end.Seventy percent of the film's screen time is dedicated to Arthur Fleck. All the other characters are ill written, only to support him. They all lack a soul. Even Robert deniero disappoints us. He lost his aura somewhere in the nineties.
The film is spoon feeding us. The viewers are not idiots we know what realism is. The scene where he realizes the character Sophie is his figment of imagination is an utter failure. Apology to Andrei tarskovski. And the scene he is showing fatherly affection towards Murray is like a worst of the worst psycho moment.
After the incident of metro killings, the plot loses its grip. I clearly couldn't define what happening and why. The script hides in the smoke of violence. That is too disturbing to watch. And I forget to mention the letter. A Pathetic turn of the film. The film 'saw' is better than this.
I hate the communist tone used in the film. By showing us a glimpse of modern times, Todd Phillips making a point. The joker is saying he is not political. It is kind of a doublespeak. In fact the film is a doublespeak. Creating chaos without the intention of creating one. The poor class killing the rich for the societies inequality.What I loved in the Christopher Nolan's joker is his philosophy. He is an agent of chaos. He like to watch the world burn. While the Batman is an agent of order. He may be a clown but he is deep inside. The Nolan's joker can make an elaborate plan and execute it efficiently. But Philp's joker is mere a delusional shallow clown. I ask myself, Why the movie is called 'Joker'. Remove the names of Wayne family and give them another names. Replace Gotham by Manhattan. The result will not be a DC joker instead it will give us a psycho clown movie. Todd Philips used an icon for his own gain.A predictable ending. Giving the society a false message.for what? The film is not worth it. Yes, it is a masterpiece. Whisper it a trillion times, may be it will became one.",1

It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world.

Well... it is NOT!Misleading name of the movie would indicate this is prequel of Batman and there is a bit - Bruce Wayne parents were killed.... but not by Joker as you may think.
The rest is psychological drama.Plot is nothing special. Far from spectacular.Acting is shallow. Disappointing and plastic (hysterical laughing). Too much killing. Should be R rated movie.Environment (the venue) is terrible. Was the idea to show all around falling apart, dirty streets, rotten apartments, rubbish everywhere?
Then riots and trashing shops, taking TVs and VCRs... was this already in Robocop and Police Academy? We did not move on from 80s?And people crazy, violent, bullying... What a poor way to portray society! There is not a bit of happiness. Is this kind of stage we appreciate and call the movie ""masterpiece""?Time and money is gone. Can't un-watch this.

Joker,dont belive the Hype,"The film is a single flea: kitchen psychology for simple minds. I find it incomprehensible why this movie has such good ratings.
But, if you look at most of the prosiele, you can see that many here have rated the Joker as the only movie, which could perhaps point to a targeted launch of the studios. The director would have to be trusted, he has served shamelessly in the film on successful motifs of earlier cult films, but without their cult to do justice. No, this movie is bad, boring and predictable. If Ledger had given the joker something more mysterious, this film served everything on the silver tray, and so paltt that it is yawning. Film should leave the space for imagination free, as the Joker generally stands for. And yes, Phoenix does a good job. But is it really a theatrical performance to distort your body like that? For me, the whole thing was almost too much, even his laughter and triggered in me rather a Guidance of Fremdscham, - but not because of the role, but to aim a bit overacting, the ""too much"", the film and the philosophy the director generally seems to have been.

Joker,Terrible,"I don't understand why this trash movie is being reviewed so well ! I saw this movie and this was a very depressing movie with an actor that was totally forcing the laugh of Joker and it was pathetic! Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger and Jared Leto did a much ....... better job with the role of Joker ! This 2019 Joker is just an extremely malnourished sorry excuse of Joker!

Joker,Pseudo art for theatrical wannabes,"That is one of the most aimless, predictable and shallow films I've seen. The only thing that made any sense was that it was somehow connected to the Batman universe. Joaquin's ability to portray a psychopath, although pointless, was ultimately decimated by the fact this was a Batman film. I can't really take it seriously because of that. There is no real social drama, it has no message and is full of fallacies. It doesn't raise any awareness. Dialogs when present were pathetic. All in all the Joker is neither a real film based on true events nor a fiction. It tries really hard to do both and it fails spectacularly.18 out of 40 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

I really was expecting an amazing movie according to all the reviews ... but really, it - does - not - make - any - sense.
What in this movie makes it so different that it deserves a 10? On average, users would review that a 6 or an 8 at max.
So i wonder if there hasn't been a scam somewhere telling people: ""Put a ravishing review on Joker and you'll get an iPhone for free!""
The movie is very slow, very repetitive, not surprising, dragging, stupid (Joker seems to be 50 while Bruce is 10 ...

Joker,dont belive the hype,"The film is a single clich√©: kitchen psychology for simple minds. I find it incomprehensible why this movie has such good ratings.
But, if you look at most of the Profiles, you can see that many here have rated the Joker as the only movie, which could perhaps point to a targeted launch of the studios. The director would have to be trusted, he has served shamelessly in the film on successful motifs of earlier cult films, but without their cult to do justice. No, this movie is bad, boring and predictable. If Ledger had given the joker something more mysterious, this film served everything on the silver tray, and so paltt that it is yawning. Film should leave the space for imagination free, as the Joker generally stands for. And yes, Phoenix does a good job. But is it really a theatrical performance to distort your body like that? For me, the whole thing was almost too much, even his laughter and triggered in me rather a Guidance of Fremdscham, - but not because of the role, but to aim a bit overacting, the ""too much"", the film and the philosophy the director generally seems to have been. Which was also because the movie Phoenix gives little room for character development, which is not on arduous paths. Whenever a point is reached where Phoenix could lend the scroll a little magic, and lift it above the stupidly conceived character, the movie switches to the next scene to tell us more about its stupid geckoes.

Joker,Rehashed Hollywood Garbage.,"One of those rare instances where the critics were more accurate in their ratings than the general public was. 8.7/10 rating on IMDb, 92% of people liked the movie... It's absolutely egregious, and goes to show how far people's film standards have plummeted. ""Joker"" is objectively one of the absolute worst films of the year, with nothing short of a hack writer attempting to mimic Scorcese's brilliance.There are several Scorcese films that I could use as examples to properly convey how identical this story's formula is compared to those, but I think the most obvious one is ""The King of Comedy."" It's such a blatant ripoff that people should steer clear from Joker and just go watch that one. It's the same viewing experience, but you'll come out of it feeling like you didn't lose any brain cells, which is a win in anyone's book, unless you pride yourself on your ability to flip your brain on/off like a light switch, which is something totally outside my scope of capabilities.Unlike most moviegoers, I enjoy paying attention to the story, and this story makes me want to shoot myself in the head. Not because it's depressing, but because the screenplay is so awfully predictable and totally devoid of realism that even attempting to place myself in the shoes of those who enjoyed it makes my soul weep. In spite of that, movies like this will continue to be made and accrue millions and millions of dollars, and people will continue to somehow find the relatability in films made by people so far up their own asses that they have totally lost a grip on reality.
P.S. If you want to watch a movie that truly deserves all the recognition it can get, go watch ""The Lighthouse."" There's your recommendation for the day from someone who's had enough of rehashed Hollywood garbage.",1

I never got a chance to watch in the theater and I'm very glad I didn't. This movie was 2 hours, that felt like 4, of flat boring plot. Literally nothing happens in the movie. All it is a very mentally ill insecure man talking to a therapist, laughing, and killing people. Arthur's laugh is terrible and annoys me throughout the whole movie. Arthur has no depth or personality. This movie was so boring I started falling asleep. Anyone who things those movie is a deep and meaningful masterpiece clearly has not seen other movies. I can list off so many other movies that are much more moving and deep than this. All this movie does is try to show that the villain, The Joker, from the comics is a distraught weak man. But in reality the joker from the comics is anything but that. He was crazy but a compete mastermind. The 11 Oscar nominations are idiotic because this movie is anything but Oscar worthy.6 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

The Joker we get here is stupid, slow, a born loser and laughs like a moron. A Joker for this type of story needs to be cunning, sly, tough and intelligent. Instead we get a millennial version of Forest Gump that's been dropped too many times on his head.10 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,One of the most boring movies I've seen so far,I keep waiting the whole movie for something to happen but nothing happened. The movie is very boring and slow the plot is simple and bad overall I don't recommend this movie to anyone it's a waste of 2 hours of my life.14 out of 35 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Joker,So much potential bud wasted! Overhyped and weak. People actually think they have to say this is good!,"Let me make it clear at first. I'm not a fan of superhero movies and Marvel comics. I actually didn't think Dark Knight was a masterpiece either. So I was so looking forward to this movie when I realized this is not a superheroic-avengers-batman movie type, but actually is a psychological study using the famous and complex character ""Joker"". So even before watching Philips' movie I was a fan.But Joker's plot is actually very shallow with plot holes and it never gets deep (tries hard to but always fails), you never buy anything that happens or things that lead things to happen, it's hard to sympathize with Arthur, Joaquin Phoenix is my favorite actor but he's so tied up with the overly acted Method thing. Other characters are poorly written, it wouldn't matter if they never existed. This is actually a VERY POOR character development, while the whole movie must be about character developing! What happens in the end has nothing to do with ""the Joker"" and mostly it looked like a stupid show which you think you have to like! I had a hard time to believe this is actually ""Joker"" and how he was made! The costume and good makeup doesn't make him Joker enough!To me Todd Philips tried hard to make a Scorsese-Nolan type of movie! But he doesn't get even close to them and that's why this movie doesn't look original and is a good copy at its best. It would be better if it was longer. Even the trailers are totally teasing the last 10 minutes of the movie. Either it's just a commercial thing or the director doesn't believe in what he has made himself.I know that this movie shouldn't/couldn't be compared with the Dark Knight or the Batman (1989). But still..near Ledger's Joker, Joaquin's Joker is a joke!",1
Joker,"Sick,violent and pointless movie","If you want to be entertained, this movie is not for you. It's a movie about a depraved, amoral, extremely violent ""clown"" with suicidal tendencies happy to see the world burn. It's completely pointless and depressing. Todd is the polar opposite of Scorsese and Nolan and this movie is a reflection of his talent. You'll get a week long hangover after watching this movie.11 out of 26 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Pretty ho hum to be honest...,"Basically just surface level fare for audiences that crave some shock value but aren't willing to go looking for something better, or deeper.I didn't feel much of anything the entire duration, indifference turning to eventual boredom.The last act definitely gave me something more to work with, but by that point i'd already lost all interest and just wanted to get out of there.Joaquin is always good at playing unhinged, but i'd pass on this performance any day of the week for his turn in The Master, or even You Were Never Really Here. The former film has what this never could: nuance, intrigue and something to say. And the latter one does a more entertaining job of being an empty art film genre blender.13 out of 32 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Complex nuanced throughly despicable manipulative piece of garbage tremendously well acted,"This film is loathsome vile trash that betrays every possibility of powerful storytelling or message it comes in contact with. The Joker is a villain, a personification of evil. That is Not a character to use to explore how society treats the mentally ill socially unable or persecuted. This movie will give rise to hate and fear of the ill and powerless and make heroes of tragic unfortunate people who do monstrous things. Had Arthur retreated into the Joker as a fictional character he then took on, this movie might actually be saying something real. If there had been any moment of true choice between good and evil for a oppressed person to choose to become a violent oppressor of the innocent as well as guilty then That would have been saying something real. Instead the writer and director of the film puts his own Joker fantasy up there murdering both the archetypal myth power and the examination of social ills he is juggling around in an attempt to get fame and attention. And like for Arthur it will work. Sort of. For awhile. But we the audience and society at large are left with Penny and Sophie and the copycat clowns fates. I'm not really sure which is the worst end of that deal.",1

Joker,Grossly Overrated,"This movie is nothing but an over rated flix by the psycho teens when compared to what Nolan had given us. Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor, I agree. But he couldn't tally with 'The Heath Ledger'. Also,what this film lacks is a good script and direction. Now you may think me as a Nolanist, but I doubt you would do the same after you watch this. The film failed to give the kind of satisfaction you would get after Dark Knight.Let me point out one or two things:1. I felt like the Joaquin's joker had a feminine shade. Especially towards the end of the movie. This is in contrast with Nolan's joker.2. Joaquin's joker aimed for fame and notoriety. However, the previous joker wouldn't even know what he was doing
the mischiefs for, if you asked him.3. The script is mellow at places and as a result of the same the movie loses its pace here and there.My verdict again : Overrated, grossly.",1
Joker,Worst movie ever!,I was so excited to watch this because of all the hype and I was so disappointed!! In real life people are just not this mean and I found it ridiculous that rich people = bad and poor people are so down trodden and everyone is mean to them . Americans are nice and kind and this movie could have had some balance and then it would have been believable. Even his own mother is a terrible crazy child abuser! I hate this movie and found it unbelievable,1
Joker,Such a disappointment!,"A waste of time and brain cells. If you want the story of Joker, watch Batman. This is anything but the Joker. Just the story of an old mentally disabled guy, pathetic and sad rather than scary, sometimes even disgusting. His laugh, overacted by JP in way too many and too long scenes, is annoying and stupid; it does not, by any means, convey the emotions of a cruel vilan. Also, the age of the Joker (sorry JP) does not fit the timeline, he is way too old.

Joker,Bring your phone and ear-buds,"Yes folks, have your ear-buds plugged into your phone and settled in your ears and have your favorite podcast cued up with the ""PLAY"" button on the ready, because 20 solid minutes of this movie are nothing but Joker-to-be having laughing fits or doing slo-mo dances. That's how we know he's going crazy! Every 15 minutes or so the ""plot"" pauses for a shakey-cam, weird-angled, slo-mo mess of nothing while we hostages are forced to sit unengaged and watch.No spoilers here, because the movie is simply the trailer X 100. Half-crazy weirdo in ugly, dirty city gets picked on and betrayed, then goes full-killer crazy. There is not a moment of subtlety or curiosity, nothing for you to wonder about in terms of what will happen next. Your two modes of viewership are CRINGE alternating with YAWN.Don't tell me this is great psychology. It's NOT. Just imbue a guy with Daddy and Mommy issues, make some cliche reveals about his lousy childhood (as if we didn't know it was bad), and photograph him in one scene after another laughing insanely, dancing in slo-mo, and getting stabby/shooty.Happy tunes from the 50s through 80s play over Joker's weirdness -- get it? It's irony! Bet you've never seen that before!The movie is literally ugly, with muddy lighting and uncomfortable angles. Yes, I get that it's supposed to be a depressing, discomfiting story about the inside of a sicko's mind, but a better director could have depicted real life without making the movie literally hard to watch. That's largely because there is NO PSYCHOLOGY in this movie. It's just a repetitious, collage of every cliche about madness and badness since you were sitting around in your sleeping bags telling urban legends.I hesitated to give a one-star review because people will dismiss me as a hata, but I honestly think this movie deserves it.",1

This was a big baby dancing and crying for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it. The plot is also paper thin and is mostly lifted from better movies.Movie attempts to have social commentary about mental health yadda yadda and fails miserably. It's like it was written by a high schooler who just learned what psychology is and has seen Glass too many times.Currently the film is being over praised as ""brilliant"" and it's simply not. The only brilliant person on set was the director of photography, because it is an excellent looking movie.I wanted this movie to be good but it's literally just Joaquin Phoenix prancing like an idiot and being sad. It's not even that violent or visceral. The only reason to watch this is to be able to discuss why it's so horrible.",1

Joker,A joke without any entertainment value,"First , this movie made me start an account to write a ""review "" .
I completely dont understand all the good ratings and praise for this movie .
Also it always hurts when this type of movie could have lot to offer , but for me was nothing more then total let down .
I dont like the Joker caracter at all in this movie , not a good joker in my book .
Combined with a story that doesnt manage to pull me in or do anything at all for me , i felt this movie was boring pretty quick , and im an easy goin guy that can manage to put brain on hold for a movie if needed , normally it would take some longer before i start thinking ; hey ,i may be watching a bad movie here.
I can handle some graphic violence , i wasnt sure if it really served a purpose here .
Because of all these type of reviews , u start wonder if something is wrong with majority of people , or am i totally out of touch with a new reality .
I never watch any review or trailer beforehand .
I always use this website to find reviews of similar minded people , then have more entertainment then the movie i watched before and gives some piece of mind . To be sure it wasnt me on a bad day i rewatched the movie and still found it complete garbage .
I rate lowest possible because the high scores , but not sure if i would be willing to give any more if had lower rating , as i really did not like anything about it . Because the joker is so badly , wrong displayed in the movie , and i feel a really good movie about the Joker would not be that amazingly hard to make , this is just dissapointing beyond words , all the good reviews , i dont understand at all and is both annoying and disturbing .",1

Joker,"''Joker wants to be a movie about the emptiness of our culture. Instead, It's a prime example of It''","Until now, the only review of this movie that I mostly agree with is the review from The Times. I stole the title of this review because it just hits the nail on the head.In the first impulse, I didn't even want to watch this movie, because I'm just fed up with the Joker. DC has many, much more interesting villains than Joker. It's time to tell stories about them and not constantly repeat the Joker's story, where there is no chance to say anything new, because in fact the Joker is not an interesting story at all, anymore. A rejected, angry man, who fails in life, a clown who becomes a killer - story as old as the world.Everything that could be said about Joker, said Nolan in the Dark Knight Trilogy, plus various comics and yes - Batman and Joker cartoons too. Nolan also told the Joker story more subtly than this movie, not only by the whole story structure, but also excellent dialogues. People who, I already see, claim in the reviews, that it is this film, that fully reflects the depth of the Joker character or that it is such a successful '' artistic '' film - they simply try to cast a spell on reality, giving the film a meaning that doesn't exist .In Nolan Trilogy Joker is really The Joker - madman, but with hatred and goal to burn the world down. Joker kills Rachel which Bruce never gets over. Alfred burns Rachel's last words to save Bruce from more pain. In an attempt to save Bruce from confronting Bane, Alfred disarms him with the truth even if it means saving his life. Even tho he isn't mentioned in the 3 film, you see how Joker messed up the characters in this film . But he isn't the ONLY ONE who beat Batman in this trilogy. All the villains beat Batman in one way or another. Ra's broke Batman's will, Scarecrow broke his mind, Joker broke his spirit, Two-Face broke his hope, Bane broke his body, Talia broke his heart, hell even Catwoman broke his trust early on....Joker didn't know Batman's identity. He didn't even plan to torment Bruce for years.....But the effects of his actions in the previous film TDK are felt in the third one. By corrupting Dent, both Batman and Gordon had to stage a cover up - we see Gordon struggling to deal with this lie, praising the man who almost killed his child. The lie he told 8 years ago for the greater good is eating him up inside. Then there is Bruce - Joker may not have known his identity but he certainly deduced that Rachel meant something to Batman. Joker kills too many people to force Batman to remove his mask and Dent boldly steps up to claim he's Batman. Rachel sees this on the news and is disappointed that Bruce did nothing to intervene and it's arguable this is what drives her to write the letter choosing Dent over Bruce. It is this same letter Alfred burns to spare Bruce more pain, thus leading to the bitter break-up between Bruce and Alfred.This third movie is the aftermath of the Joker's actions and how the characters and city of Gotham are coping with it after 8 years. TDKR feeds off the relevance of its predecessors like any good third installment. 8 years of false peace covering a giant lie and watching that lie eat at Bruce, Gordon and the city.The lie that enabled The Dent Act to be passed, removing organized crime and as a result removing the need for a Batman. The rich and elite benefitting from the clean streets while the middle class and poor gap widens.The fact that Batman and Gordon had to lie proves to the League that Gotham is truly beyond hope and must be destroyed.And a lie that caused Bruce and Alfred to break up....Joe Chill broke his happiness when he pulled the trigger and fired the bullets that killed his parents and also Falcone and Maroni were indirectly responsible for Batman's birth, and what makes Nolan's trilogy a masterpiece is indeed how each of his enemies are responsible for major tragedies in his life or events that will scar him for life and as for the enemies he fought in the trilogy. I would say that The Joker (not only cause he's the archenemy) is the one who got under his skin in the most personal way not only by killing Rachel but by corrupting the ""honest and perfect"" White Knight but because he forced Batman to take on a role that in Batman's eyes it would be best for him by sparing the truth of who the real white knight was when he was pushed to his limits.Nolan put in each film the right villains needed for all 3 stories. Not only are they responsible for tragedies in Bruce's life, but they mirror Bruce like some twisted perversion of what he could have been IF he crossed the line of an executioner. This is for me one of the most interesting elements of Batman from the source material.Him never crossing the line his villains deliberately or accidentally cross is what he uses to check himself so he doesn't end up like them. In Rises there are many instances where I actually thought Bruce wouldn't make it! Seeing a hero humiliated and vanquished was so unexpected and effective it made me actually care for Bruce more than ever! There was a lot at stake this time around... More emotional layers are in the third film.The problem with THIS movie is that the creators here openly say, that Joker is mentally ill. What?! This is a parody of the whole idea of The Joker. Yes, he is a sadist and psycho, but not in the sense of '' crazy ''. Besides, this movie is also full of cheap and failed imitations and quotes from movies like Taxi Driver or the Nolan Trilogy, Why do so few people notice it? This is not a breakthrough film, it is a mixture of everything that came before. Infantile psychology at the level of high school dramas for teens and the plagiarism of many other outstanding films. Making a '' serious '' movie about Joker is possible only thanks to Nolan, he, thanks to his Trilogy, has changed the approach to the whole genre, '' Batman Begins '' was the start of the more serious approach to the superheroe movies overall in cinema (Begins was released before Marvel movies).But of course everything about the most popular villain of all time - Joker - is promoted on a gigantic scale and in this particular case, '' The Joker'', the rest of the sheep followed it. Phoenix is a great actor, no doubt, but in my opinion the whole movie - script and direction - is full of clich√©s hidden under the guise of the social commentary that is another primitive truism.I will quote the Times review again, because it is excellent at exposing the shallowness and pseudo-artistic nature of this film : ''The movie's cracks - and it's practically all cracks - are stuffed with phony philosophy. Joker is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it's imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more violent tirades, Arthur muses, 'Everybody just screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore.' Who doesn't feel that way in our terrible modern times? But Arthur's observation is one of those truisms that's so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing.''Another problem of '' The Joker '' is a very chaotic structure, which means that there is not too much entertainment and pure cinema in this movie. After some time it just becomes boring mess.What was great about Nolan was that Nolan was able to combine the features of commercial, mainstream and independent film in one and what he said was authentic. He knew that such a film must also be entertainment, but he didn't limit The Trilogy to it. This accusation, which Nolan haters often repeat - that Nolan is pretentious is not true, especially in Dark Knight trilogy (because I can agree that Inception is terribly pretentious). In TDK Nolan doesn't arrogantly run away from mainstream, because he fully understood what it takes to make epic, successful superhero movie, but at the same time, he added depth to this story, by exploring both the dark and the altruistic side of Wayne / Batman and exploring, but not overdoing the Joker.Nolan Trilogy revived the genre without a doubt. We talking about real change - originality in the approach, but still entertaining. Nolan's version was finally epic tale about moral choices, tragic fate, true heroism of a man but also our weaknesses and about evil personified in Joker- evil which very often is just trivial, but still destructive as great Michael Caine/Alfred says : ''Some men just want to watch the world burn''. So no matter how many great superhero movies will come and how critics will judge them, Dark Knight Trilogy is in history books, because it changed the genre, just like Pulp Fiction changed gangster films. Before DKT, superhero movies were very schematic and mostly drab. Now they are mostly sophisticated, every director wants to do something new and original or simply more within the genre and they are all following Nolan's footsteps.Whereas Joker by Todd Philiphs is the quintessence of pretentiousness and fakeness. There is nothing authentic in this movie. It is a collection of cheap fanfiction, quotes from movies like Taxi Driver&Nolan Trilogy (even if Todd said he did it to pay tribute to Scorsese and Nolan, it turned out clumsy), poured with sauce of pop culture tricks. Phoenix battered body twists and turns on the screen, but there is no soul in this creation. Time to say goodbye to Joker, DC. You have much better villains in your stable, whose story can be fascinating to tell. The Joker ceased to be interesting long time ago. Btw, Batman has always been a more interesting character to me, because although he is a superhero, he is also the only such a popular superhero, who has so much darkness, killer impulse, but also humanity inside of him (and Bale showed all of this masterfully in Nolan trilogy). The ambivalence is fascinating here. The Joker is a wounded clown, nihilist, murderer. This story is told in the cinema several times a year. There is nothing fresh about it.",1

Joker,Overestimated Garbage,"I don't understand why a typical viewer would care about a cinematography great acting work of a dillusioned and psychopath. Indeed a masterpiece of a frick, a true and vivid depiction of a disturbing man's evil character and violence with an irritating laugh that spreads paranoia and chills to the viewer. It's just a very well mastered work of a drama and at some point justification of evil and criminal acts of a disabled man.. No action, no good story, no other heroes, not something special. And definately not for the young audience who were misled to think that they would watch some action adventure batman-like movie. Not at the slightest point..
Last but not least.. I believe it sends disturbing messages, justifying the evil to ""evil"" or just ""guilty"" people and TOO LONG for a movie of this style, a waste of time not offering anything to a person who just needs to enjoy themselves for an evening..
ps: I also feel that the poor actor after this film may suffer from the same or similar illness of the character he was depicting so truely..22 out of 65 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,"Good, but not as good as I wanted it to be","I would give it a 7 or 8 at most, but too many 10's and ""Masterpiece"", ""Best joker"" reviews made me feel like I need to point out what is wrong with it and why this hyped reviews are wrong.First off the movie is not at all bad, I have been pretty sick of cliche superhero movies lately and this is a very nice change, just not an awesome one. I went in with full expectation I would like the movie seeing all those reviews, maybe they raised my expectations too high. I felt I saw a very classic story of a bullied man turned mad, nothing special about the overall plot, its not complicated, is not philosophical, no memorable, impactful dialogues, monologues, or even phrases it doesn't give you much more to think about than ""Bullying is bad""Now to the real gems of the movie Acting, Cinematography and Score. The acting was great, but not as great as people say, I have seen enough movies to know excellent acting when I see it, in simple terms, you must not see the actor, but the character at all times even if you are trying to see the actor, like Christian Bale in ""The Fighter"". That masterclass is what I was hoping here knowing Joaquin Phoenix capacity as an actor, as demonstrated in ""The Master"", and though there were times this was true, there were times it just felt like he was trying too hard to be a maniac, it did not feel as natural as I hoped it to be, and it may be Phillips' fault here since he is not very experienced directing masterclass actors or maybe even recognizing masterclass acting.For the Cinematography, There were some genuinely beautiful shots in this movie, many of the shots felt like a comic book frame, the only thing I would complain about is that I did not feel like any of them really stood out, I did not feel any of them gave us any kind of subtext that gave us more information, more to think about or even simply hypnotizing enough to be called masterclass, I may need to watch it again with more attention to be sure, but overall it was great and definitely one of the better elements of the filmNow for the score, for me probably the best element of the film, it does really capture the haunting feeling of being alone, sad and insane at the same time and without it, the best scenes of the film would not have been as great as they are. but as much as I loved it, I still would think hard considering it ""Masterclass"" though I would give this element a 9/10 without thinking too hardI really wish this movie is as great as people say, I really believed the hype, but I sometimes forget that I may have seen more films than the average person to see the flaws not many people seem to find, in a way is sad because I know I will never be easily satisfied with a movie the way I did when I was a kid.Im giving the film a 3, but only trying to balance out the undeserved many 10 reviews it has, the film should not have more than an 8 at most",1
Joker,Overhyped trash that grossly misrepresents the mentally ill,"Murder is not a good response to bullying. Murder is not a solution to wealth inequality. Are these truths not self evident to you as they are to me? Yet there are lots of people here saying they empathise with Joker? How? I couldn't get into this movie at all, because the main character's motivations are entire alien to me. I don't get him. I don't get this movie. I don't get how anybody can enjoy this movie.This movie is depressing. The tone is dark, all of the characters are terrible people, and there is violence in every other scene from beginning to end for 2 hours. How does anybody get entertained by this?Is it OK now to portray the mentally ill like this?! So if you take away their therapy and their pills, the mentally ill will just all turn into insane criminals full of hatred? This is gross misrepresentation. In 50 years time, we will look back on this misrepresentation of the mentally ill the same way we look at blackface minstrel shows about negroes today.",1
Joker,Disgusting links towards mental illness,"This film proves how American TV, News and Films run off. I get the film and how some people like it but we can't ignore the fact it glorifies a Killer by using his mental illness as a sympathy cast for the viewers. The film has us trying to sympathize with mental illness patient who's sessions and medications is taken away and how society act towards him brutally, by him killing his oppressers and starting a riot. NO this is how America idolise school shooters by making them famous so that inspires other's to copy that and when Arthis realizes this he kills a TV Presenter live and is glorified as untouchable when the police car crash. This film makes it okay for people to think it's okay to kill and ruin lives so if some people are weak mentally than they will repeat an act of killing to be glorified and sympathized with this character.

Joker,Most overrated movie ever,"Have you ever seen one of those low-budget art movies in a small and smelly theater which shows mostly Polish and captioned character-development films? Well, if Joker blew your mind as a very sophisticated movie that deserves a 10-star rating, you obviously haven't. It's simply another one of those films that, for some reason, has been shown in mainstream theaters.
Being fair, it probably doesn't deserve the 1-star, but two or three. The lead actor does a great job. Which was easy in this case, since he already did essentially the same role a couple of years earlier in ""You were never really here"" (2017). A better movie hands down, but because is was not about a comic character and was shown only in one of those smelly theaters, didn't got much attention.
Definitely overrated by people who love the kind of movies that show in smelly theaters and by people who never go there and thus think this is sophisticated and mind-blowing.8 out of 19 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,A Dark View of Mental Health Care,"Do I love this movie or hate it? I was extremely disturbed as I watched the main character, Arthur Fleck, being abused, laughed at, and ignored as his mental health spiraled downwards into a very dark abyss. What made the movie more disturbing was that this could happen to anyone under an unfortunate set of circumstances. As Fleck (the Joker) became more an more unbalanced, the mental health care system was portrayed as virtually non-existent. But perhaps this is closer to the truth in real life. This movie was a very dark view of the mental health care system, and a warning of what can, and will, happen if we do not respect the mental health care system and the people who work within it. I felt the entire movie was done in poor taste, and yet I was further disturbed by the number of audience members who actually laughed at Arthur Fleck and his unfortunate circumstances. It is a grim view of how many people still view those with mental health issues.**If you have friends of family who suffer from mental health issues, please DO NOT let them see this movie!!",1

Joker,I don't understand the hype,"Being a fan of all things batman for most of my life I really looked forward to a different take on the joker origin story. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.
As to not give anyway any spoilers to those who have still to watch it and I suggest you don't.
It's slow slow slow. You are bored bored bored with no actual storyline to keep the viewers attention until the last 30-35 minutes.
There have been comments on the extreme violence in the movie. I definitely would not describe it like that. It's not exactly a Disney production but I've seen more violence in any bond movie.
In short it's a bad movie and I was shocked that the main actors would of agreed to participate in such a terrible film. However the parts they played they did play well.16 out of 46 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Why so tedious,"I think this is the worst film I've ever seen in the cinema. So tedious and boring. Says nothing of any worth about any of the subjects it raises and the lionisation of Joker is ridiculous. He is a joke, not a hero. His mental illness and treatment by others is something we should empathise with and yet he's a loser, he is an A hole who we are meant to feel sorry for?? he's not scary and he kills with no consequences. The people that then support him and cheer him on - he's doesn't even engage with them. He says nothing to them, not a word. There is no message and if I hear that laugh again I might, well, let's not go there. This film is so disappointing and just awful.

Joker,The most boring movie of the year,"Joker is a joke, a very bad joke and not funny. We find ourselves with a film in which scenes are repeated ceaselessly in slow motion to make clear something that is known from the first minute, the protagonist is an unhappy, idiot and mentally ill who lives with his mother.In a Gotham that has nothing of Gotham, it is rather the New York of gang members of ""The Warriors"", with a Joker that has nothing of the authentic Joker they try to sell us a movie that only stands out in boredom and predictability.When I came out of the cinema everyone said that the film was very bad, several fell asleep during the screening. I don't know where they get that it's a great film. Such a mystery.For me, the worst movie of the year.",1
Joker,Extremely good movie ruined by Batman having to battle a geriatric Joker.,"I know you'll hate on me for saying this, but this Joker is better than Heath Ledger's Joker. This doesn't mean that Heath Ledgers Joker was bad. Unless there is a better performance this year Joaquin Phoenix should get the Oscar for this.But what went wrong here is that there was no protagonist vs. antagonist. Yes the ""world"" was shown to be the antagonist, and for a certain while it worked. But this movie needed a Batman. And I mean THIS movie, not any other Joker movie, but THIS movie specifically needed a Batman. Because then the ending does not seem satisfying enough. But still it was a good movie. It was pretty brave to show Thomas Wayne and Pennyworth as jerks. And what was up with their age? Why were Thomas Wayne and Pennyworth and Martha Wayne so old?So in the end I'l say, this 2 hr movie had at least 1/2 hr worth if needles scenes and exposition. The build up was good. I'm kinda conflicted. 1 and 1/2 hrs should've been given to the Jokers creation back story and 1 hr should've been Batman. Or maybe not. I also feel that adding Batman to this movie would've caused it to flop cause we still haven't gotten over the horrible Snyder version of Batman. So I'll give this movie both 10/10 and 1/10.",1

I had no idea what the film was about.The Positive: Joaquin Phoenix is an extraordinarily gifted actor and this piece of garbage screenplay was was a great vehicle to showcase his talent.The Negative: Everything else. This movie is about whatever you want it to be about. What is real and what is imagined is up to you, the viewer to determine.What a cop out.I can envision intellectual snobs sipping their brandy and pontificating on the deeper meaning and symbolism of the film.There is none.",1

Joker,Exactly as bad as I thought it would be.,"This film is exactly as bad as I thought it would be. It's a great performance for Phoenix but nothing else good can be said about the movie. It is not a comic book movie or even a movie about the character, I didn't find it funny or entertaining. Frankly it's just a mindless blockbuster, it does not provoke thought nor does it have any true commentary. It's made to be edgy but lacks any true substance.12 out of 34 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Typical Hollywood product of these days,"Compared to other people who disliked this movie because of expectation, I knew that it wouldn't have been a typical comics-based movie, but more of a dark psychological examination of a man. Well, it was trash anyway.The mental disorder was treated in a cartoonish way, while the movie around it wanted you to treat everything as serious and ill and shocking as possible. It would be like making a serious movie about Donald Duck's reasons to not wearing pants, and passing it as a social commentary of some sort. Because we all know that, social commentary = deepness and intelligence!Simply put, this is a great Hollywood product of these days, where movies are created to impress the main viewers (average man and lower) most superficial thoughts, to make them feel they are intelligent and deep watching a profound movie, with deep meaning and incredible social commentary. But, for anybody that has seen enough cinema in his\her life, the trick is easy to spot, both in the direction and the dialogues.The acting is very good in some scenes, but the script he has to work with... oh, poor Phoenix.",1

Joker,Is This a Musical?,"Because there is a lot of singing and dancing, way too much singing and dancing. There was also a lot of slow, brooding music, long takes of nothing much, and even less in the way of dialogue, more long takes of JP's face, and lots of laughing. We get it: the dude is major-league crazy. The film runs over two hours and you don't have much more information than after you watched the minute and a half trailer: a guy in a clown suit who is insane and possibly dangerous.Had there been nothing from the Batman legend connected to this movie, it wouldn't have made a lick of sense. How this mentally ill, mental midget is to go on to be a criminal genius is a mystery.

Joker,This is the kind of movie Heath Ledger's Joker would make just to watch the world burn,"This movie means nothing. They just went ""what's big right now? Incels and antifa? Those are the same"" and rolled it all into an existing character that could use politically and socially relevant anxieties as developing characteristics... but to make absolutely no ""message."" and no, films don't have to have a message, but it's so clear that this movie WANTS you to think it has one.It doesn't. Joker insists on telling you he's not political multiple times in the same way people tell you they're ""sick of politics,"" only to ignore the influence of politics in literally everything that led to where he is- and you're never given a clear sense of what Phillips wants you to believe from that point on, because the chaos is so much more intriguing to him than anything of substance. Whatever.i generally like Todd Phillips movies and think they're fun, and despite this having a stellar performance from Joaquin Phoenix and generally enticing production design (whoda thunk a Taxi Driver-inspired film looks nice in 35mm!), this might be the kind of movie that upsets me the most, because it insists on masquerading as something smarter and more important than the ""average flick.""And no, i don't think Joker is an incel, and I don't think the movie is about antifa...I just think this movie uses the social and political contexts of two big modern ""movements"" (for lack of a better term) as a sort of set dressing for its story. I don't think Joker is an incel, but his ""rise to madness"" is set about by a provocation in the same way that incels very publicly enact violent acts against women. It's this idea that they've been pushed to violence because a sect of society ('society' in a post about Joker, finish your drink) has unjustly acted against them and this is their rebellion. Joker uses the same sort of justification and refusal to feel remorse for his violent actions as Elliot Rodger does, but without the misogyny.It also uses Antifa in the same way- the imagery of political violent unrest and masks, all literally and declaratively set in a large city and staged to be demonstrative against wealth and facism? Both his inspiration and the images he wants to conjure in your mind- yes, despite being set in 1981- is what he knows the audience will recognize to be closely associated with Antifa.The thing is, he uses these ideas and images and characterizations in a way that don't really...make any clear comment on the things themselves. Which feels weird. To make an extreme comparison, it's like writing a road trip buddy comedy that pulls heavily from the recognizable imagery and characterizations of slavery, but doesn't... seem to have any particular stance or opinion on slavery.",1

This is not as good as these people are making you believe. It's worse. Much much worse. Doesn't deserve to be on top 250 either. The best comic book movie of this year remains the masterpiece that was Avengers: Endgame. Watch that instead of this garbage. Love how people are giving it a 10/10 just because it has Joker.

There are 3 jokers in the works, Caesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger. Ledger perfected the roll....lets just let it go guys.The movie itself was disturbing as far as mental illness goes, but it was much more disturbing as far as DC Villain backstories goes.

Joker,Time will reflect how truly bad Joker was,"I was so hyped to see this movie considering what DC accomplished with all three Dark Knight movies. I let my guard down when it comes to DC Films, BIG MISTAKEJoker recieved so much hype because the movie studio spent a large portion of Jokers marketing budget engineering public opinion. Its the only rational thing I can think because Joker is nothing but a giant crap. Forty five minutes into the film I wanted to walk out of the movie theaterJoaquin Phoenix would laugh at awkward times and did this alot through the entire film. It never gave you a sense that Joker was starting to crack. Instead you feel that the director was telling Joaquin ""Laugh now"" just to remind the viewing audience that Joker is crazy. It was so stupid.Mr. Phoenix is getting so much praise for his portrayal of Joker yet to be totally honest it stunk. Heath Ledger's joker was better and more realistic. In fact all three dark knight movies were better than Joker in every aspect especially the realism department.Joker is one of those movies that 3 months from now when the movie studio has stopped the social media manipulation the truth of how bad the movie really is will shine through.Congratulations DC you Hoodwinked Comic book movie nerds once again including me.",1

My time watching this movie is pretty much wasted, I should have stayed at home and watched anything else or played games rather than going to the cinema to watch this.... I wonder how much money did they pay the people that gave this movie 10/10.The whole movie is painfully slow going and around the middle of the movie when you actually start having a thought of leaving the cinema, they give you a bit of action that will prolong your hopes of something actually starting to happen. Then it's back to the same old torture. The last 5-10 minutes of the movie are better then the rest 110 min of it and even then it's kinda meh, totally average. Hell, the first 110 min should have been flashbacks or something that was condensed in 10-15 minutes to start off a real Joker movie, then insert the end to heat things up a bit in the middle of it and finally get into some real action with Batman.My advice, go watch a cartoon rather than this movie. You will probably enjoy it more...",1

As such it is pretentious, trying way too hard to be serious, while being almost comical at the same time, because of the Joker makeup, but failing at that too, because of the dark undertone.

Joker,Avoid this movie: here's why,"Heads up: this movie would be very bad for your mental and spiritual health.I made the mistake of deciding to see it--by reassuring myself that it would probably be a great Batman spin-off movie.I was very wrong.This movie is about a psychotic loser who goes postal. It strenuously tries to pull you into its dark vortex, and offers the following justification and rationalization of all the macabre violence: poor, bullied Joker had a hard childhood, and a hard life in a corrupt city.Positive reviews can talk all they want about ""great acting,"" and ""great lighting,"" or whatever; but they're just fooling themselves, and maybe you. It's a sick, juvenile, pseudo-profound story. (And oh, yeah, I didn't like the Frank Sinatra songs--or those of pedophile Gary Glitter, either!)People exposing themselves to this damaging film can only come out of it damaged.",1
Joker,lackluster of a joke,"Great actor and everything is cool but i spend to watch a movie about arthur, its not joker. joker showed up like the last 10 minutes in the movie. they should be ashamed to make a movie about mental patient went mad idiotic to become the joker. plus you want to give sympathy to a guy couldnt face society thats the real world is hard and it would kick ya down. so lets put a smile on that to make him a mad clown to cause chaos. sorry this is not a joker origin. this is a joke67 out of 294 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Poorly written & played out,"I started to go off the film at the first beating he took, I know it's a film but it was just poorly thought out, no way would those kids have carried on with that sign that far, they'd have just dumped it. His kick in only resulted in one big bruise on a shoulder, nobody would run up a back street alley on their own against a group of lads who had already demonstrated they were trouble. Then he gets chased by those 2 cops, he runs fast, no way would fat cop keep up, the stairs up to the metro alone would have put him way behind joker! Then his dad coming out the show with wife & child. Who killed them? It didn't make sense. They came out alone & walked up a dodgy alley, someone of that status would have his own chauffeur waiting at the stage door. Then the activists in the ambulance ramming joker in the police car, totally ridiculous how did they coordinate that? Then he's knocked unconscious & the Cops are left for dead, they pull joker out, I assume as some kind of mascot, then he miraculously comes back to life & starts dancing around, no cuts, broken limbs etc. Just plain ridiculous...... but by this time I already disliked the film. Fiction it is but it's got to have some kind of realism to it & on that it failed majorly!In Batman, I loved Joker I'll stick to watching him in that because alone he is pants!",1

Joker,Garbage,So much I could say. This is sad because I'm a fan of the Batman franchise and I'm a fan of Joaquin Phoenix. He was great in gladiator and he was incredible in walk the line.I'll agree to disagree with the director on this one. The Arc of the story is not a narrative which is one that is well told shot or portrayed. And I I'm a film student from one of the best colleges in the country. I'm sorry to give it such a low score cuz I had such high expectations from it. But I have to maintain my honor my integrity and the truth. I could go on and on scene-by-scene frame-by-frame shot by shot. It's sad depressing that's not why it's received the score but that is part of the tone of the movie. Doesn't properly explain the character of joker and I think his inability to control his laughter as psychotic is a huge discredits towards the legacy of the comics of Batman.5 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Joker,Garbage - Don't Watch at Home During the Pandemic,This movie lacked so much and there's no point for me to reiterate what others have already shared. Just read all the low rating reviews of this film. I think the 10 star ratings are from those who don't care about the screenplay when watching films. The script drives the plot and the dialogue in this film is awful. The dramatic aspects of the film are not even engaging. I also think the 10 star ratings are from those who only view films that are hyped via social media. This is NOT an excellent film. It is GARBAGE so don't waste your time watching while being quarantined at home. There are better films to watch at home.5 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

Joker,"Shameless ripoff of King of Comedy, deserves zero merit, also propaganda","So Hollywood basically wants to use comic book characters to push political subversion now. I get it. In Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wants to reduce the population by half for the greater good. In the comics, he was doing it to win the love of a female version of Death. In the movie, Thanos all of a sudden cares about managing the population through controversial means.In the Joker, somehow, WB wants to turn this character into an anarchist and terrorist; he's basically Antifa. This movie makes no secret of the fact that he's being depicted as the good guy here. That's why I just didn't like this movie. I think it's dangerous. Do the rich get away with too much? Yes. Does this movie have anything to do with the character or the Batman universe? Really and truly, no. This movie is a one-sided political statement in favor of Antifa. I'm not dumb.Worst of all, is this even canon? Is Phoenix the new Joker? Did they basically just make Batman the bad guy? It seems so to me.I would have to say that if this is an origin story for The Joker, it's the worst one they could have come up with. I could have written this as a kid. There was no nuance in the film. This is what any eight-year old would have come up with watching Batman as a kid. Real life isn't like this.This was terrible, it will be forgotten in a year or two, max. I guarantee it.I have to add, I've just seen the King of Comedy and Todd Phillips shamelessly ripped it off. He has fooled people into thinking he made something original and artistic when it's glorified rehash of that movie with the Joker name slapped onto it. I'm glad I didn't pay for this, really and truly. This does not deserve Oscar consideration.",1

His dancing was cool/weird too - just not cool/weird enough to watch again.
Oh, so the movie was a decent character study, sort of like a family drama. I'm nod sure of the 'era' 30's, 70's (it had a bid of both, after all Bruce Wayne was still a child in this one).
Still not sure what to make of it.DON'T believe the hype.

A completely different take on Jokers life which contradicts the previous incarnations. Just thought he could've been more 'psychotic' lol.

Joker,Joker (2019) with/ Joaquin Phoenix - Total Garbage.,"I normally don't write reviews. But this piece of junk robbed me of roughly 2hours
of my life, so i thought i'd stop in and do a review.A friend bough this Movie on Blue Ray January 2019 & said come on over and
watch it Saturday night. I said , ""ok"" even though i knew it would be bad.Anyway , i stuck with the movie the whole way because i assumed it was goingsomewhere and going to get better + my friend had spent the money on it.
-Well my friend and the other person in the room 25min in to the movie said
""they said this was a masterpiece on the reviews, this is terrible"".
-And by the end we all agreed it was terrible, only about 3 segments/scenes picked up at the end.Joaquin Phoenix i'm sure tried his best with the stupid script they gave him,
but it just came off as being crazy and creepy. Not at all entertaining to watch.If i would give this Zero i would. And that's saying something, i really did try and be open minded about it.Don't waste your time.",1
Joker,Tremendous,"My Verdict of JOKER 2019
Joker movie is a thunderous masterpiece! Can easily compete with the best comic book films of all time. The best movie of 2019 which belongs more in the Joaquin Phoenix Universe than the DC Universe. In the media, director Todd Phillips's Joker movie has been frenetically celebrated and a possible Oscars 2020 blessing (otherwise unthinkable for a comic-based film) is speculated violently. Let me say it loud and clear: there is not a word of it exaggerated Joker movie is an ""origin story"", which tells how poor Arthur, nicknamed Happy by his mother, will become one of the most famous enemies of Batman. However, here there is no question of the Dark Knight, the story unfolds when Bruce Wayne is still a child. Surprisingly, Joker movie is totally a drama. A hard drama, rough, bitter, in a sticky environment. An environment that does not help Arthur to adapt. Director/writer Todd Phillips & co writer Scott Silver take time to present the characters, places and situations. Joker movie is a work closer to auteur cinema. It's important to note that there's nothing wrong with this movie. Director Todd Phillips manages to infuse a very stylized colorful theme with the dark at the same time. It's bold, devastating & utterly beautiful. The some where staging tackles you from the first second, shaking you through for two hours and never letting go until the last second. Joker movie is a horror story, not the celebratory tale of an antihero. Joker is a game changer and plays in a league of his own. The great soundtrack consists mainly of classics of the swing era (Frank Sinatra at all) and is an integral part of the plot. The congenial score of Hildur Gudnadottir amplifies the power of the images many times, so that every scene penetrates deep into the bone marrow. Director Todd Phillips is a revelation at the helm and does the best directing job of his career with the twisted material, able to strike a tone that straddles stabs of bleak darkness, gasps of hope and pangs of inevitability. I doff my hat to you sir! DOP Lawrence Sher's no-frills work to emphasize twisted, dark city escapes, streets & nightmarish forms deserves a huge shout-out. With picture-perfect contrasts & color, sublime compositions, the rich and complex mise-en-sc√®ne succeeds in elevating the movie. But all of this impressive, stylish construction wouldn't have worked without Joaquin Phoenix. He inhabits his role with a commitment that's magnetic in its unpredictability. His unbelievable performance will leave the most lasting impression on the audience. Robert De Niro - one of his best roles for a long time! Zazie Beetz is remarkable. I left the cinema with lasting impressions & my mouth open. Beneath this gripping, bold, revisionist psychological thriller, Joker is the comic book villain we deserve right now. Joker movie is a masterpiece! Its understanding doesn't cross the line into sympathy, as we're left watching a man who becomes less & less human as his tragedy unfolds. We repeatedly see him burst into laughter, but can never rule out whether he's actually crying.

For the joker movie, I have to say that I felt absolutely nothing coming from it.
One of the worst ""acting and story"" you can actually see it portrayed in your life .
De niro is the actual star and Joaquin Phoenix is great as well but maybe in other movies.
When I see a 46 years old man crying for his father and asking to be hold by him -whom he never mit before- and regardless of the character age, I felt pitty for the people who actually went to see this movie at cinema.
Young people may like it as they maybe didn't see good acting before and cannot yet differentiate good acting ( Jack Nicholson) from great acting ( Heath Ledger) from bad or mediocre acting ( like our hero today).
Story is known, no need to review it.

Joker,Applauding this film's message is profoundly disturbing.,"Joker is a billion + dollar validation of the over-arching ethos in today's society: ""I am a victim"".For folks who work hard every day on internal locus of control, personal responsibility and (despite the pain and suffering that is guaranteed in this life for ALL of us) maintaining a sense of gratitude and hopeful perseverance, it should be a shrill and disturbing alarm that this film receives seemingly universal praise amidst even louder righteous acquittal of the main character's murderous vengeance.Worse, one reviewer here decreed everyone in the world EXCEPT the Joker needs to be a better person. Particularly those of us who can't ""relate"" to feeling alone and isolated. This is the same mentality that would put the blame on ""mean people"" or society in general, and then specifically on a mental health professional rather than the individual who decided to go out and murder.Victim stance is far worse than a distorted, personal-responsibility-absolving crutch, it is a powerful, addictive, debilitating narcotic already being mass produced/consumed in our present society. And this film is one of the dealers.",1

Joker,Miserable and Unpleasant Slog of a Movie about Nothing,"BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they're not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they're ""incels"" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan's marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger's Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix's Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It's a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because ""they've had enough!""Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you'd think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them.",1

There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.

Joker,Overrated and badly directed film with a misleading title,"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today.",1
Joker,I don't get what everyone else seems to be seeing.,"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end.142 out of 290 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Generous 3.,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3.",1

Joker,"Dark, serious, tense... and bad!","Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film.143 out of 304 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,"Went into this blind, and i didnt enjoy it at all really. disappointing.","I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.104 out of 228 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Overhyped movie,"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.94 out of 209 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,A decent performance by Joaquin Pheonix sadly let down by a poor and dissapointing script,"After seeing the billboard signs all around the London Underground and learning that the critics has approved of the film in their masses, I was very much looking forward to what appeared to be a very different and almost arthouse interpretation of the Joker.Before I tell you what I think of the film, I want to go into what I believe the Joker to be and the interpretation of him based on the comic books. Firstly as per the source material, the Joker is not actually insane but rather what one psychiatrist in the comics describes as being 'supersane'. He sees the irony in the world and the way that it works. Like the Comedian in the Alan Moore comic book 'The Watchmen' (which at one time was going to use the Joker before settling on the Comedian character), he treats the world as 'one big joke'. The Joker does not like to conform or like to follow rules and regulations. In the comic books the Joker is a failed comedian who is driven over the edge after a series of tragedies and then snaps out at the world. This is by no way saying that his actions are ever justified. On the contrary he is evil, ruthless, daring, sadistic and twisted. But not conforming to societies rules and norms makes him far more intelligent and innovative.With that said, I was somewhat dissapointed in the way that the Joker was portrayed in this new movie. Yes, Joaquin Pheonix is a great actor who deserves recognition for his performance here, though I would stop short to suggest that it is an Oscar worthy performance. But the fact that his character of Arthur Fleck is compromised from the start with both psychological issues and a laughing condition, which makes him laugh uncontrollably when he is nervous or anxious, dumbs down the origins story. One does subsequently feel pity for Arthur throughout the film from seeing him get mobbed by kids on the street, being refused psychological treatment due to funding cuts, being treated terribly by his work colleagues and boss, having to look after his elderly mother, the issue of unrequited love with his neighbour, his subsequent humiliation at the hands of Robert De Niro's character and learning about his mother's past, which leads to the bloody and brutal finale. Ultimately, Arthur's transformation to the Joker is due to the brutality and harshness of society and the way it treats those who are different. Whether this is through its lack of caring for the the sick, the elderly, the mentally challenged or even the physically disabled. The fact that he shows some sympathy to the dwarf character, also strongly suggests that this Joker is not actually evil. This is the complete antithesis of what the Joker is. Infact, I really don't see this interpretation of the Joker successfully standing off against Batman. As a result the film left me somewhat dissapointed. Part of this was also because the script was very poorly written.The redeeming part of the film is the ending, which combined with several earlier flashback scenes makes you wonder whether the events in the film even took place or were just a figment of Arthur's imagination, very similar to the ending of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America', which suggests that Robert De Niro's character may have dreamed up all the events of the movie. After all the joker does state in the comic book 'The Killing Joke' that if he prefers to have a past, he would rather it be multiple choice, so this is a valid hypothesis. Which leaves us to ponder whether this film should be considered as Cannon to the Batman universe or not. I myself prefer that it was not considered to be cannon and an glad that it is a standalone film.The film is inspired of numerous films throughout the decades, which includes the Kings of Comedy, Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver, Falling Down, Only God Forgives and Drive. However, I personally don't think it has the intelligence or effectiveness of Falling Down or indeed the panache of another film that I recently saw from Indian cinema, which I would highly recommend to readers, called Wajood starring the brilliant Nana Patekar. For me the Joker could have been a better film as a standalone study of mental illness, without the Batman Franchise being associated with it.",1

I wanted to love it so much, and it was only reaching an entertaining moment in the last 15 min when it actually starts turning into a comic book movie. Although Joaquin created a very deep and dark Joker, he has nobody to bounce off of. The character in a Batman or actual Arkham Asylum scenario would be very interesting I didn't find this version very interesting. Also unfortunately I don't see anything in this Joker movie that makes me think Todd Phillips could reach anything close to Taxi Driver.

The two main influences are Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which are overrated and yet still much better than this trash.The worries about violence are overblown, mainly because the movie doesn't even have a real point of view. Does it want to be an exploration of someone with a mental health issue? There's only occasionally surface-level rumblings. Does it want to be a villain origin story? We've already had multiple, better origins for Joker. Does it want to be a superhero take on The King of Comedy? De Niro is barely in the film and not realistic in the slightest as a character. Does it want to be a Psycho-esque story of a crazy boy and his crazy mother? It hits all the wrong notes. Does it want to be about a woman who finds out her boyfriend is insane? The neighbor shows up rarely and without logic - there's no reason to have her in the movie at all. Does it want to be a Breaking Bad sort of story of how one man goes bad and starts murdering? He was never good to begin with; the story is almost pointless. Does it want to be a commentary on modern rich v. poor, conservative v. liberal protests and issues? There's nothing remotely close to any substance there, and any relation to the real world is extremely convoluted and poorly thought out.Every plot turn is easily seen a mile away but treated like it needs a huge buildup. All of the relationships are hollow and unearned, the characters being mere pawns for plot machinations that aren't even worth the time. Joaquin Phoenix is great in the role, so I guess there's that.",1

Joker,A total letdown ... a hybrid film bordering between Taxi Driver and the Purge film trilogy,Ugghhh how could I be so wrong in my assessment of Joker when the majority of film goers and film reviewers have rated this abhorrent film an average of 8.6 on IMDB? What have I missed seeing? How can over 600 thousand film goers have liked this film and the film receive 11 Oscar nominations when both Mrs. Shullivan and I just hated it and considered it as much a waste of time as we did with the 1977 acclaimed film Eraserhead?Joaquin Phoenix being nominated for a best actor Oscar? You have got to be kidding me? Maybe he should have been awarded a medal from Weight Watchers for shedding 52 pounds for his pathetic role as the brooding and mentally disturbed Arthur Fleck aka Joker. But an Oscar nomination?We chose to next watch the 2019 film Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood which was nominated for ten (10) Oscars this year and it is competing with Joker's eleven (11) nominations. I will be shocked if Joker wins any Oscars and even more shocked and disappointed if Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood does not win against Joker in any of their competing categories.Let's see if my rating of 3/10 holds true on Oscar night and if Joker gets shut out as I would anticipate it would.,1

Joker,"Tired, Tedious & Tragic Turkey - Give It A Miss!","JokerWords completely fail me, I just had to sit through two hours of watching an alcoholic in Judy and now I am made to sit for two hours watching a lunatic in Joker. In both I was neither educated, entertained or informed. Both movies were utter cobblers and should be cast into the void where they will find the ultimate turkey that is Carry-On Columbus.This purported to be an origin story of master villain extraordinaire, Joker. We got zilch on how he became a master criminal, he had no henchmen, we had no bank robbery, we had no car chase, we had no joker, and on top of that his arch nemesis Batman was a small boy when they were contemporaries. This was incoherent nonsense.Joaquin Phoenix's performance had so many problems,1, he dominated the movie by being in every scene, true, but the story was so unfocused it became an interpretation of a man struggling with a mental health condition. The main problem was the Joker was not an interesting character, he was bland, predictable and revolting.2, his characterisation rested upon physicality, he lost weight, he was half naked, he contorted his body, with the inference twisted body twisted mind, does Hollywood really think an audience can be duped by such an obvious trick, this was no Raging Bull or Dallas Buyers Club. I wanted to pass the hat around the cinema to raise funds to buy him a shirt and then make him wear it.3, We had raw method style from Joaquin that was largely improvised to fill the void. There must always be a reason behind behaviour otherwise it is meaningless and so it was here.4, The Joker, unsurprisingly, it's in the name, was funny, if he was sad, it was pathos, this was unremittingly morose. Jack Nicholson's performance captured this but it was absent here.This was a miserable, instantly forgettable movie that lacked any focus or story. Around me there was a constant stream of people walking out who felt they had been sold a pig-in-a-poke, and went to watch Aladdin instead, as did I.",1

Joker,"Glorifies mental illness, overacting by Phoenix","I am the kind of person who enjoys a good anti-hero now and then. But Joker took it to another level, they overly glorified violence, mental illness.
The worst part of the movie was Phoenix. He is completely unbelievable as the Joker (a supervillian, remember). He overacts the whole movie, and you just lose sympathy for the character since it is so overdone.
Overall a bad movie, keeping in the context that this is supposed to be a ""superhero"" type movie. Might be an ok art-house type movie, but the fact that they tried this with comic book characters just ruins the whole thing.

Joker,Disturbing in the wrong way,"I've read some respected film critics refer to this as a powerful character study of a person with a mental illness, or an illustration of how damaged loners can be dangerous to themselves and others if they're left untreated by society. Maybe this is how they read the movie from their educated, middle-class standpoint. Maybe millions of film-goers will think the same. If so, then (once again) I have good cause to worry about the impact this kind of film can have on society's perception of people with mental health problems. Goodness knows, it's bad enough already. So bad that people are being driven further and further into themselves, fearful of saying too much in case of the repercussions: stigmatisation, prejudice, bullying. One thing the film does get right, actually, is that society doesn't seem to care about such people. Unfortunately, content like this will probably make society care even less.Great acting and cinematography. They're about the only good things I've got to say. Otherwise, it's a poor rehash of stuff that's already been done before and much better. And its exploitation of mental illness and misrepresentation of pathologies are unforgiveable.",1

Joker,"Excellent Acting , Too Dark For Me","There was a lot of hype behind this movie, negative and positive. I was following the positive and was really looking forward to it.I am going to start by saying ""well done"" to Joaquin Phoenix for an amazing performance. He was absolutely believable. You can and can't relate to what is going on in his mind. It is twisted in the Joker sense.Now, I found the movie dragged in areas and found my mind wandering or slightly dozing off. I could have easily watched this in 2 sittings. My issue with this movie is that it is a really dark(subject) movie and by the time it ended, I felt really down and spent. It was almost like it was work to watch. It has absolutely no replay-ability for me. A movie really needs to draw me in to watch over and over again, usually in to the double digits. That movie is a 9 . I don't want to watch this again and that is why it gets a 3.5 and that is all Joaquin Phoenix.Will I watch the next Joker movie? Absolutely.",1

Joker,Nothing special.,"Was bored through a lot of this. Anyone saying this is a ""masterpiece"" is just jumping on a band wagon.

Joker,No. Just No.,"This movie is so bad; like incredibly bad. There is no plot other than the pity-party of a troubled man. Nothing exists beyond this in the form of character development: past, present, or future. Not even supporting characters provide relief. You can tell they just wanted to point a camera at an actor and tell them to act distressed and estranged then go home and call it art/film. The final straw was the fact that the Joker I have known is cunning and plans elaborate schemes. This ""joker"" could not even plan what is for dinner. He is just along for the ride and 180¬∞ from the true character. They could not have missed the mark more.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,not an action eoic,"I found this movie as slow drama, the funny parts are: the dwarf cant reach the lock on the door to leave, and the ending, where he is interviewed by Maury. Other than that, this isn't a real edge of your seat action film. The movie is mostly a prologue to joker before batman.

Joker,So dull,"2 hours of movie with about 10 minutes of interest. The Joker is a study in how to take a beloved icon and turn him into a pathetic loser that no one cares about. This Joker isn't a clown prince of crime, he's a failed clown who is terrible at his job, terrible at life and needs to be medicated to prevent delusions of competency. Sure there is a subtext of how society is fails those who need mental help, but that theme is buried under the 'eat the rich' theme where the man trying to help pull the city out of a rut is demonized.
Frankly this movie is little more than an exercise in 'woe is me'-ism and not worth the time needed to watch it.8 out of 21 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,A movie that didn't need to be made.,"Although Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job, this backstory trip into the pathos of the Joker could have been achieved equally as well with a few lines in another movie. It's incredibly predictable. I am one who doesn't mind a slow brewing movie as long as there's a point to it, which this movie achieved in its first slow closeup.

Joker,Angst,"Ages 12-35 will love this movie. Like seemingly every other character study in Hollywood, it exaggerates the impact of poor parenting and bullying to appeal to the masses who feel a certain way about how poorly their life has gone. The movie wanted to be realistic and gritty, but it wasn't. If just one person could show me where all of these 30 year olds who are getting bullied for doing their jobs are, maybe it would validate some of the ridiculousness.
Using a famous character unnecessarily to make this movie is another issue I took. Creativity is lacking though, and money must be made, so I digress.
The pacing was decent, but the first 1.5 hours were almost too boring to stay awake though. The redeeming quality was the acting, though not ""Oscar worthy"". Phoenix almost always turns in a good performance as one of the more versatile actors.11 out of 32 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Would of got up and walked out for a refund if I was on my own. Heath ledgers performance as the joker was more believable, scary and funny.This joker film isn't funny and I didn't laugh once. It's a low budget cash grab, with an actor who cant laugh properly and someone who clearly wasnt invested in his role and was clearly after the pay cheque.

Joker,Blasphemous!!!!,Whilst Joaquin Phoenix shines as the Joker this movie was an extremely blasphemous telling of his story. Rating the movie as a tragic tale of a tortured soul driven to the breaking point I'd rate it 7 out of 10. But as the origin story of the Joker I'd rate as being on the waiting list to get to 0.

Joker,As tedious as a 4chan troll. Emo angst for Edgelords,"Before getting to the film proper I must say I think the score is quite good. It is hauntingly beautiful and wonderfully atmospheric. It is a shame that the music has to be associated with the resulting film. The score repeatedly ends up putting a shine of the film that it truly didn't earn. I greatly dislike the film but the score is one of the year's best.Anyway, there are any number of films that take on this general material of the alienated white guy who snaps because of the (alleged) mistreatment by society he receives. Just going from memory you have Taxi Driver (the film lifts the journal concept from it), King of Comedy (the film lifts the obsession with the comic from it), Falling Down (the exaggerated violence) and One Hour Photo (heavy handed symbolism). Joker most closely follows King of Comedy but it is a slew of all of these films. Quite frankly I don't think there is an original concept in the entire film. It all would be pitiable if such an aesthetic deserved pity.Worse the film's overall structure just lends itself to tedium. Fleck is an unreliable narrator-any number of scenes occur within his psyche and much of the film you see is narrative untrustworthy. I am sure there is a clear tell between reality and Fleck's delusions (clocks always have the same time by way of example) Whatever the solution is I don't think it matters. You still dealing with a warmed over re-hash of white men feeling left behind by society changing. It is either a projection of theirs (which it is) or society doesn't care about white male pain. (laughable) Regardless, the extra work you need to do to put the narrative in proper context isn't worth it. Traditionally, the Joker's origins are unknown and I think the film raises the distinct possibility that Fleck isn't really the Joker. The film feels like it goes nowhere.This emptiness is best captured by the only provocative moment in the entire film. For plot reasons I need not get into Fleck ends up in the Joker make-up *and* wearing a Joker mask. So a joker face is behind a joker mask. This mask-within-a-mask moment is central as the implication that Joker-ness is merely masks all the way down is too forceful to ignore. But if it is just masks all the way down the film is utterly unsatisfactory. The solution in the origin story film cannot be there is no solution. In any case, any number of scenes of Fleck being weird and edgy simply drag.I suspect I am rather cool to the overall picture because I don't particularly like Phoenix's performance. It is one of those engaging but bad performances that people mistake for great acting. It is not going to age well. Whether it is the laughing-while-sobbing moments or the ponderous delivery of the overwrought lines Phoenix is working much too hard. The performance is all flash and much like the film it is constructed out of far better work.. There is a bit of Crispin Glover here. There is some Travis Brickle. Ledger's Joker was clearly studied. And so on.It is simply perplexing that this film is making any waves at all in the award season.",1
Joker,Way overrated and stretched.,"I like the cinematography, their choice of actors and the main and sub plot but two hours is far too long. It could have been shorter. For half the movie, I was asleep because there was no actual thing going on in the movie. I didn't know if his was imagination or an actual scene and that made it less entertaining to watch.

The trailer of the movie did it a huge favor making it more attractive, while it is just a mess in the negative depressing world of one falled comedian, hold on! Is that movie about Tommy Wiseau? Nevermind, that one is bad on purpose. If I can compare it to something similar I will pick ""The machinist"" for the fitting in character and feel sorry for the character in good ways. Some people like it because the Joker is right for his actions, and causing the disturbance in the plot and in the real life as well, how strong one movie can be to affect the real word too? Well that one can be is you feel rejected by this reality we live in. Don't go crazy because you saw a movie, be crazy because you are individualist that is crazy by nature.

As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.The ""Joker"" in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.The REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.The movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it's qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.However, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that's Hollywood today.That the politically biased and elitist so called ""critics"" on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy ""review"" site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though.

He will only be a mentally ill person with no talents (and intelligence) in anger. Nothing more. As a film, Joker lacks creativity or depth. In all senses.

Joker,Joker is what happens when one reads Taxi Driver wrong.,"Travis Bickle is also an anti-hero like Arthur Fleck, so many bad things at once, a product of the times, but his actions are never justified or rendered aspirational either through plot or aesthetics of the film. The same goes for Rupert Pupkin in Scorsese's another masterpiece 'The King of Comedy' from which Todd Philips, the director, heavily borrows but without any proper insight or thought. Class divide, neurological issues, childhood trauma and all that glitter is thrown in the movie to disguise the shallow depth of ideas and adds to the confusion. The film tries to be so many things and ends up being none. 'Poser' would be a better title.Joaquin Phoenix's acting is everything though. Very familiar but still feels fresh and knocks your socks off (and oh that laugh is haunting) and he was the singular reason I didn't walk out of the film after the first 15 minutes because the moment Arthur Fleck commits the third murder (and which obviously was not a self-defense tactic), I thought, ""lo beta, ghus gaye na ghhade me! Yahan se impossible hai nikalna."" And making my worst fears come true, this humorless film just kept on digging that first act grave.So, in short: Loved Joker. Just hated the film he was in.PS: Watch HBO's 'Succession' if you want to take notes on how to have a people as your protagonists, humanize them and still maintain that much-necessary ironic distance from them.",1
Joker,Boring and highly overrated,"OK, the story is nice and the acting is excellent. But the movie suffers from three bad things:1- Boring and uninteresting dialog. There are a lot of them.2- Too slow pace.3- Too lengthy. Too much time for very little number of ideas.These three things combined are more than enough to destroy any movie. It is the first time I have felt that I need to look at the watch to know how much left for the movie to end. Beside this, the genre is supposed to be a thriller in addition to crime and drama, but it is too far from being a thriller.I cannot understand the exaggerated high ratings for this movie. I want to be fair with it. So although it is boring, I give it 4 stars for the story and the acting, but definitely the movie does not worth 5 stars or more. Consequently, I cannot recommend this movie.",1
Joker,MEH,"You know I really wanted to like this film, but to me the plot was a let down and Joaquin Phoenix's performance while good didn't quite match the hype. It had great production, the cinematography, sound production and editing were all good.
I didn't buy into this character becoming a criminal mastermind, there was no hint of this guy having the intelligence the Joker is known, there was no plan to his actions, just reaction to his situation, unhinged reaction but nothing more. And there was no wacky monologues the Joker is know for, not it even a hint of it.
I was going to say it left me wanting more but no, I can't see me giving this incarnation of the joker anymore of my time.7 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Not worth the ticket !,"JOKER character should have been much better presented in a more psycho-path life. Suffering like in the movie is not a good cause for such a character to rise. I expected a lot from a movie rated over 9, and really disappointed with it. We were 8 watching and 4 said not worth the ticket.

Joker,Boring and irrelevant,"Joker is anything but a masterpiece, although it certainly takes itself seriously enough and it tries harder than any movie in recent memory to be one (maybe the recent Star is Born tries harder). But I found it largely languorous, psychopathic in its intent and subsequent failure to move me on any level and, well, not worth even a laugh.I don't know what the point of this film is, since it doesn't really work as Batman lore, providing a shoddy psychological construct around the Joker's origins, and if the idea was to top either Nicholson or Ledger it failed me (Nolan's Joker vision is far more nihilistic, seemingly coming from nowhere, with a twisted, brutal sense of humor about him.) Here we are meant to empathize with poor disgruntled Arthur Fleck, which might have been easier had he not been fed so many obvious motivations for his disgruntlement, and propped up by such lazy writing.If Joker is meant to 'be a mirror' to our times, it fails again, to say anything relevant or novel about society, or about the US, or the mental health system or anything really that hasn't been said a million times before, and instead seems focused on taking itself really really seriously, and wants us to find sequences of the Joker dancing to Gary Glitter edgy and bombastic, when really these sequences are dull and incongruent deadweight.Fans will lambast the haters of this film, but frankly I was bored by its flat embrace of pointless amorality. I wanted better, more biting satire, more layers, more motivation. Instead we get superficial, ultra-violent and pointless dreck which says and means nothing, even while it looks swell, has a great cast and seemingly all the ingredients are in order. But maybe that's the trade off for giving the reigns of such a film to the Hangover director.",1
Joker,To much hype,"Not sure if the controversy of the film was justified. Have people forgotten taxi driver? This is nothing new and as a comic book film it falls flat. Phoenix is great in the role but there just wasn't enough to go on and it was a muddled mess. I expected so much more from all the hype this film had and maybe that's why I'm just not impressed by it. It's worth a watch for sure but with no sequel... ""THE END"" and no Batman film to incorporate it with, then honestly what was the point anyway?7 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

The first half of the movie was pretty long drawn, towards the end it was great but not so much before that in my opinion. They could have done so much more with the time they had.
Also, something that I struggle with is that every move Joker made was very predictable basic psychology (my opinion). Joker isn't supposed to be predictable, that is a part that makes him so interesting. Besides from all that the actor did an amazing job potraying Joker!11 out of 26 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,"Well, it wasn't my cup of tea...","Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",1
Joker,Do not buy the hype!,"The popularity and the high ratings centered around this movie is due to Heath Ledger's successful portrayal of the Joker character. While Heath's performance was A-Class, it was still somewhat overrated due to his suicide and alleged but never-confirmed gossip about his suicide relating to his portrayal of Joker.Joaquin Phoenix has been a drama queen and did some weird stuff on TV to regain his lost popularity and therefore people slowly began to see him as an offbeat rogue actor and this allowed him to take on the Joker role.The movie itself, tries to make profit from Phoenix's cooked up antics by always trying to close in on his face while he is moaning or trying to laugh in an out of the ordinary matter.Heath Ledger's character was successful but the camera was never too much in his face. His laughter and his aura spread naturally. However in Phoenix's Joker, director Todd Phillips tried to capitalize too much on the hype of Phoenix's real life antics and Heath Ledger's successful Joker performance by always zooming in on Joker's face in a way to force his mentally unstable state upon the viewers rather then letting the viewesr decide for themselves.On the other hand, the movie is very slow and has unexplainable plot holes. Not recommended.",1
Joker,Shallow imitation of better films.,"Take Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (and maybe a touch of Falling Down), mash them together with only a basic idea of what made those movies good, and use a popular comic book villain as the lead in order to get far more recognition for the film than it would have gotten otherwise and you have Joker.Joaquin Phoenix may have acted the hell out of the title role, but it doesn't change the fact that Joker is at best a pale imitation of far better films that actually knew how to make a point with their social commentary.Phoenix's performance and the cursory Scorsese like visual aesthetic may have tricked others into seeing depth where there isn't any... but not me. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one.10 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Watch 'Nightcrawler' instead,"This movie has already been done, and much more successfully. 'Nightcrawler' set the standard for lonely-sociopath-craves-recognition movies and 'Joker' comes nowhere near its impact.
While 'Nightcrawler' avoids creating any sort of sympathy for the character, 'Joker' dares us NOT to feel sorry for him. It can't (or won't) go the extra mile and simply create a character with no redeeming features, which is exactly what the Joker should be. Instead, it insists on pulling at our heart strings by filling the first half of the movie with endless scenes of sorrow and misery for the character.
It is nothing more than a sugar-coated vision by the director, and Phoenix, while doing admirable work with what little he was given,just comes across as pathetic and haphazard. Almost like each scene was created on the spot.6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

As for Joaquin Phoenix, I don't know why it's an amazing performance. He lost some weight, danced, laughed, pulled some silly faces and really just played it like I expected him too... No killer scenes or memorable lines, nothing out of the ordinary or surprising.It's not a film you'll watch again, unlike other joker performances, quite dull and boring throughout waiting for a big scene which never delivers.

Pleading that it might pull out into the fast lane to overtake the heavy juggernaut of another mundane movie. For this baby was the Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa of comic book movies. Surely it should leave all before it for dust.Sadly it never did.If you want to see a man's desperate fall into madness, sadness and then ultimately loosing it. Go see Falling Down.

Joker,"Send in the gore, Bickle goes operatic.","You have to be patient with Todd Phillip's Joker before he delivers the requisite gore fest this god of sadistic comedy requires. It is carried along most of the way by the outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix and a lax system and gullible society unable to put the obvious together that allows the morose Arthur Fleck to wreak havoc in plain sight.Nothing could live up to the film's hype and outside of Phoenix's stirring but admittedly overlong performance ( a little too many yoga poses) the film depends heavily on nostalgia (music, era, Scosese) to propel its meagre satiric moments. As far as the character, Peck is classic cliche loner, Travis Bickle as Paglacci hanging around his old haunts.Like all hateful Jokers, Arthur is imbued with the ability to take an incredible beating as he does here before rising from the ashes in Todd's apocalyptic uptown climax that is more nonsensical than parable.Featuring a performance for the ages Joker ultimately is a smug gratuitously violent slasher, its unintentionally comic moments watching the heavy handed Phillips maintain PC order amid all the chaos.",1
Joker,Has the Joker Been Forgotten?,"Throughout history we have always replaced characters in our culture. Pan the god of nature in paganism was translated into the devil in Roman Catholicism in order to bring social coherence. At the moment, there is no other figure in pop culture to represent the Devil and his meticulous maniacal ways like the Joker. Unfortunately, in this film that has been forgotten.It hurts me to say, as Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors but he broke the golden rule laid out by Robert Downey Jr's character in Tropic Thunder- ""Never go full........!"" There was no moment that I felt in awe with the characters meticulous planning, cunning, and depth to speak to the chaotic narcissism within us all. This was all excellently depicted by Heath Ledger's eternal performance in the opening scene of The Dark Knight.I was waiting for that Keyser Souse moment when Phoenix's joker would take control and display a black mirror to the audience that he had been pulling the strings all along. This never came. Instead, he was a sorrowful victim of society that simply threw a tantrum and lost control, instead of being empowered, taking control and becoming the anarchistic social commentator we all know the Joker to be in the comics and films.Forest Gump, The Rain Man, Mr Robot. These are all excellent depictions of people suffering mental health issues. The writers and actors remembered to always represent these characters with a level of ingenuity that leaves the audience in awe and a better understanding to their different cognitive approach to society. This was sadly forgotten by Phillips and Phoenix, as all that was displayed was a victim of the cruel fist of society. These people who have been banished are so much more, and for that I felt the performance to be a vulgar insult.I have been a true fan of the narrative of Batman and the Joker, and the intriguing dualistic narrative displayed over decades. However, if they were to meet in this universe for a much needed sequel to represent Joker's crime lord life, it would have to be a grudge match between Christian Bale's The Machinist and Phoenix's malnutritioned Clown Prince of Crime. The Fact of the matter is that this performance was never threatening.I will forever love Joaquim Phoenix as an actor as he gave me my favorite film 'Her' but I felt that the mark was sorely missed here. I will rewatch the film hoping that I missed something. However, the film was nothing more than it's extended trailer. I was not exposed to intriguing revelations, nor was I challenged on the ideas it presented. Basically, if it is nothing more than it's trailer it is not a good film.The reviews I have read are full of superlatives and explanations, adorning the film without saying why! I hope that Heath Ledger's incredible performance will not be over shadowed by an Oscar win for Joaquin Phoenix as that would mean that the Joker will truly be forgotten.",1

Blend it with some pseudo-arthouse sequences and ta-da you have the movie Joker.Normally; mentally challenged manchilds' stories are not favored by Hollywood too much, however this movie is an exception of this category. Joaquin Phoenix really succeeded to act as a mentally challenged character. I'm saying it because it says so in the movie. I advise that the Academy Award would be given to him. I mean, aren't the new generation dumb enough to know the difference between Joker and Taxi Driver? Travis Scott ia also troubled but smart nonetheless.The ""HAH HAAH HAAAH HAAAAH HAAAAAH HAAAAAAH HAAAAAAAH!"" laugh was used too much. Those would be peak points but if it's used in half of the sccenes, it would lose effect and starts to become boring. I cringed a lot in this movie, on how cheaply they tried to express an idea. Look at the girlfriend character of Joker! She was added because Joker wouldn't look like a loser.

Joker,"""There is no punchline.""","Well, that was thoroughly mediocre.Keep in mind, I didn't say ""terrible."" It's not one of the worst films of the year. Hell, it's not even the worst comic book film of the year (Hellboy and Polar are fighting it out for that title) It's not ""good"" though either.Most of that falls on the script. It's so worked up in telling you how important it is that it forgets to even tell you why. There are a LOT of expository scenes here, and while the actors do a shocking job selling them (Every single performance in the film is outstanding), their acting can't make up for how heavy handed they get. The closest thing the film has to an ideology is this really juvenile South Park thing of ""Both sides are equally bad, but at least the Right Wing aren't pussies!"" Even worse though, because this film is begging to be taken 100% seriously all the time outside of about a handful of scenes (Which are the best stuff in the movie. Seriously, if most of the film had that tone, it would be a masterpiece.) If this was going for a satirical or campy route, it might have worked, but it just doesn't. Don't even get me started on that insanely manipulative musical score. At least it's not pro-incel like I thought it was gonna be.On top of all that, the film doesn't even pretend to care about the source material. This was very clearly an anti-Occupy art thing that was forced into being a Joker film at the last second. A name change here, an Easter Egg there.Like I said though, it's not terrible. Joaquin Phoenix is dynamite here and I really do hope that he gets that Oscar. He managed to generate sympathy for me from a character I was absolutely positive would never get any from me. I'd even argue that de Niro deserves a Best Supporting nomination here, this is the best performance he's given in decades and he gives even Phoenix a run for his money.The cinematography is gorgeous as well. It definitely nails the aesthetic of a grimy 70s crime thriller and there really isn't any comic book film out there that I can say matches this film's aesthetic outside of maybe Watchmen. Pretty much every shot in this film would make a gorgeous screensaver.While Joker certainly isn't the worst thing ever, it's still plagued by shortcomings. I can see both arguments for how it's a terrible and amazing film. For me, it was a whimper when it should have been a bang and that falls entirely on the shoulders of screenwriter Todd Phillips.",1
Joker,Not as Great as the Hype!,"Sorry, I watched this movie and it was very dark and so slow. It was more about how someone mistreated can become a psychopath than it was about the Joker. Not at all like Gotham or even earlier Batman movies. Sure, Joaquin did a good job of acting, but the movie was a drag and unless you really get off on watching nut jobs it was certainly not entertaining. Hollywood loved it because they like blood, guts, and sick people. Besides, there are so many terrible movies coming out of Hollywood, even a mediocre movie gets a 4-star rating because the others are just so bad. In this movie, there were some parts that were soooo slow I used 2x just to move things along. It helped. Could not wait for it to end. This is a dreary movie and not entertainment.

I admit, Drama isn't my favorite genre, but I still expect more than just staring at people with no dialog. The ""twists"" were not anything big or anything a normal person couldn't see coming. Really I don't think the story fits with my imagination of who the Joker is, but that's fine. Phoenix did a great job!

Joker,"Disappointing.

If they DO understand it better, hooray, but I suspect that for many it enhances real understanding little more than Rain Man did for Autism. Rather anecdotally and surface.
So, in my view, another opportunity missed.
But what really disappointed me was Phoenix. He was amazing in Gladiator, and probably did a better illumination of mental health in that.

Joker,Derivative mediocrity,"You know how people get mad at disney films for taking classic beloved films and selling them as new movies? Well I'd argue that that's exactly what Joker is doing. The film is basically a remake of ""The King of Comedy"" that brings nothing new to the table. I'd actually that Joker is almost worse than these Disney remakes because at least people Disney remakes don't try to trick their audiences into believing they're doing anything new. This film, on the other hand, does nothing new but still tries to dupe its audience into thinking its a groundbreaking work of art. Sure, this style of filmmaking is new for the genre, but this doesn't mean it's not a completely unoriginal film with nothing to say. It's the plot of King of Comedy and the themes of Taxi Driver.

Joker,Missed Opportunity,"I had been very excited to see this movie ever since I had 1st heard about it, and was anticipating its release.But when it started getting the type of hype and press that it was, I became a bit apprehensive, as the things that were being said about it, which seemed outrageous, mostly, were things that were said about other moves I had been looking forward to seeing, and that had ended letting me down.The Joker, sadly, turned out to be one of those movies for me.Now, as I know it has been said many times before, Phoenix's portrayal of man with mental health & depression was very very good & convincing.But the story and the plot seemed like a big missed opportunity to deliver an anti hero origin story of one of the most coveted villains in comic book lore.I liked the quasi mirroring of a failed system whose middle & lower class revolt against the rich, in a sort of ""if we burn, you burn with us"" type of way that has been done many times before.I'm sure people can see glimpses of that today in our US culture.And who knows, maybe the studio execs got their fingers involved, and are the ones that watered it down a bit too much.Maybe there will be a directors cut that is darker than the theatrical release.I certainly hope so.Because for all the reviews I have read that speak of people walking out of theaters because of the dark feel and psychological overtones being too much for them to stomach; all I felt was a sense of wanting it to be bigger and grander than what I was seeing.I would recommend seeing this movie so that you can formulate your own opinion, but I gave it a low rating, because when it was over, I walked out feeling like I just saw a movie I've already seen many times before.",1

Based on the joker image of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, I was convinced that the Joker would commit violence for the sake of chaos like Tyler Durden in Fight Club or boredom and pure narcissism like Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. 'Do I really look like a guy with a plan?' or 'some people just want to watch the world burn' are inseparably connected with the character for me. The Joker is crazy. But to become the symbol of a movement and to hide from the judiciary in the longer term, it also requires a certain genius.There is nothing like this to be seen or even implied in this movie. The Joker here is broken, deeply hurt and pitiful - very well acted though - but just not cunning. The good news is that he cannot inspire imitators like that.",1
Joker,Love it or hate it....,"There appears to be sharply divided reactions to this film. Reading some of the other reviews, people thought it was brilliant, or a piece of garbage.
My own opinion - I hated it. The best aspect of Joker is Joaquin Phoenixs' acting. He did a great job with a crappy script and a mostly incoherent story. Forget any relation to the Heath Ledger portrayal of Joker, which was smart and perfectly played. This version of Joker has little to do with Batman, although there are scattered connections in the film.
I'm sorry I watched this. Guess I hoped it would get better, but for me, it just stayed at awful throughout.5 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Joker,Clown Prince of Comedy,"What a god awful mess.
I've given this a 4 because a drama costing 55 million should be a damn sight better, had ""joker"" not been the premise of this movie I would have given it a higher rating, I'll explain, this is not the DC Joker, this is a story of a mentally ill man, borderline sociopathic and living the most drab & dreary life possible who then descends into madness & becomes a full psychopath, we get barely any build up or development of this asides from ""Arthur"" being beaten up by a bunch of kids then by a trio of drunk yuppies but we get endless scenes of him agonising over his boring dreary life, now as is its good but nothing more than that, Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant & will most definitely get the Oscar for his performance but this movie is then spoiled by the pointless references & inclusions of the Wayne family, its just enough tidbits thrown in to try to authenticate it as existing in the batman universe, there isn't homeless people shuffling around the streets to show how bad life is, no yuppies partying showing how good life is for the elite, nothing to show the huge chase between the rich & the poor & so nothing to justify the rioting in the streets.
all these reviews praising it for it being dark & dreary, bleak & depressing, what is wrong with these people, this is not a tour de force of cinema, all of you stop with the ""oh this is like real life"" ""best DC movie ever"" the story is completely garbage, the origin of the joker, total BS.
so basically this is ""The king of comedy"" story line with senseless murders & pointless riots & zero enjoyment.
So Todd Phillips states ""this is not the joker you know"" he is definitely right with that but if this is his version of the joker separate from the comics or previous films then why include the Wayne family & why include an iconic scene from the comics which was also the scene recreated in the Tim Burton Batman movie.
The one thing that made the joker character so interesting was his mystery, Tim Burton almost ruined that with his brief origin of the joker, Jared leto almost ruined the character with his sleazy portrayal but Christopher Nolan's idea to keep the jokers origin a mystery & just allow heath ledger to develop the character his way was shear genius.
This film would have been better had it left out all the joker references, it would have stood out on its own, but to pass this off as the origin of the joker is quite simply the joke itself, shame on all of you involved, when you take such an iconic character you have an obligation to do the character justice & you failed, this film only stands out because of the incredible performance of its star",1

Joker,A Good Lead Performance--Yet a Poor Character Study,"""Joker"" has received a ton of attention--and controversy--in recent weeks, with strong reviews from the Venice Film Festival leading up to a Golden Lion win, but increasingly divisive and polarized reviews after that. I was very excited for this film because I really like Joaquin Phoenix, and was especially interested in the idea of doing a character study-style take on the comic book movie that would theoretically feel unique to most of the other, CGI action-filled ones. Don't get me wrong, some more traditional comic book movies are very entertaining, but I thought that this could be a fresh take on the genre. Sadly, I was wrong.Much has been said about Phoenix's performance, and I will say that he is quite strong here. He looks somewhat unlike his normal self, as in remarkably thin and frail--and convincingly plays the part of a genuinely disturbed man caught in the desire to seek attention solely to augment his own psychotic state. His fits of laughter sound both funny and depraved, and you can tell that he truly immersed himself in character. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is extremely disappointing. The film's plot is rather generic--that is, when the movie has substantive plot points. With the exception of one scene, there are not many key plot points in the first two-thirds of the film. As a result, the film starts to feel stale and extremely repetitive after a while. We know that Phoenix will continue to gradually lose his mind, but what else are we supposed to take away from this, especially since the film's supporting characters are uninteresting and often underdeveloped? The film tries to be a homage to some of Martin Scorsese's earlier films such as ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver,"" but ends up feeling like a disingenuous knockoff rather than a clever homage to Scorsese. Even though the film's idea of making a famous comic book villain into a dark psychological drama/thriller sounds ""original,"" the actual film itself regrettably does not feel original at all. The script is generally fine, but it fails to give Phoenix as much of a range as he should have in this role. (However, he does incredibly well working with what he has.) The film is also poorly edited at times, with ringing noises and music sometimes juxtaposing or intruding on what should be key moments based on character and dialogue, rather than sound design--although, to its credit, there are moments of strong cinematography and lighting. While some will like it--hence the divisive reception--I was deeply disappointed. 4/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. The film's picture and sound quality were greatly enhanced in this format.",1
Joker,"Deeply boring , no memorable scenes","If you like watching 2 hours of dark depressing material with little or no plot or memorable scenes then this is for you.

Joker,This really says a lot about our society,"The Joker movie was hyped up from the subreddit 'Gamers RiseUp' late 2017 and until the movie was officially announced, gamers across the world came together ridiculing people of other ethnic groupsone big hype, was for the Joker to be an advocate for gamers everywhere by saying the line ""we live in a society"" which to their suprise, Joaquin Pheonix promised to say the famous line
but in the film, Arthur Fleck/the Joker never lived up to his promisethis makes me think, that the people behind the movie, were a bunch of CHADS who wanted to make gamers look bad and catch it all on one convinient page and then just straight up quarantine itdo you know who else were obsessessed with catching large groups of people away from society and later taking away their lives, NAZIS

They've the got mental health, but we better just pretend why they're paid. What? So it stole the fantasy. And it offered us psychology. Who would have watched it if they knew it was this? Would it be breaking its box office? No. So they inserted this. Disappointed. Get your own psychodrama. Give us back the comics. Come on.Only rating it 4 for the Joker, Heath Ledger. What a shame.",1
Joker,Why so this way,"Hi, first of all I tried not to compare this to Heath's performance, but after half the film passed by the grip of what could have and replaced by oh no, I must say Joker's display was one of feeble stance. Sure life knocks you in the face with iron knuckles, yet Heath showed it could be appreciated with a smirk. Phoenix buckles inward because he just can't help it and doesn't like it.
This might have been set up as a possible gate way to how and when he started to be Joker as we all hoped to see, but it sure as beep left me seeing a sorry of an excuse to turn so dark for some everyday struggle gone bad and turn left at revenge intersection.
Never was, in my recollection, Joker set out best as the dog who didn't know what he'd do once he got hold of the bumper of a car going by. Now they showed a possible reason why, and deep down they shouldn't have showed this. It's too beep easy passing the start frame and collect your 2000.

Joker,HAH HAAH HAAAH HAAAAH HAAAAAH HAAAAAAH HAAAAAAAH! What?,"Berate me new generation about what is funny. Is not-being-able-to-funny, funny? Is cringe comedy (bspw: Borat) really funny enough? Blend it with some pseudo-arthouse Bullshei√üe and ta-da you have the movie Joker.Normally; mentally challenged manchilds' stories are not favored by Hollywood too much, however this movie is an exception of this category. Joaquin Phoenix really succeeded to act as a mentally challenged character. I advise that the Academy Award would be given to him. I mean, aren't the new generation dumb enough to know the difference between Joker and Taxi Driver? Travis Scott ia also troubled but smart nonetheless.The ""HAH HAAH HAAAH HAAAAH HAAAAAH HAAAAAAH HAAAAAAAH!"" laugh was used too much. Those would be peak points but if it's used in half of the sccenes, it would lose effect and starts to become boring. I cringed a lot in this movie, on how cheaply they tried to express an idea. Look at the girlfriend character of Joker! She was added because Joker wouldn't look like a loser. One can't manage to get the point.Also, they squeezed in Batman character unnecessarily in a boring way. That's why I'm giving 4/10, not 5/10.",1

Joker,Not what they say,"The trailers caught my attention and I thought this movie would be well worth my time. I was wrong.I'll start off with the good points. The acting was phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is impressive. The visuals were also good. Music was pretty great, minus the Gary Glitter song, which I believe he should NEVER be endorsed (look him up).But it ends there. The story had a lot of potential. You want to feel sympathy for Arthur Fleck, but it becomes increasingly hard as the film goes on. He is sick character and that's how Phoenix portrays him. Frankly, the darkness of the film, the mental instability, will start to take a toll on your own state of mind. There is no light at the end of the movie. Only gory darkness. The gore was terrible. Overkill. I have an easier time watching Tarantino. I had to lower my eyes at times because looking felt wrong.The overwhelming amount of 10/10 reviews are false, no doubt in mind. Can I see someone liking this movie? Yeah, of course. For me, and for a lot of others it seems, it was just too much. The unrelenting grittiness was not needed and was a bit sickening to say the least. I left the theatre in need for a shower to wash away what I'd just seen.",1

Joker,Immature and pretentious,"As someone who has never been interested in DC films, ""Joker"" was never something I was particularly looking forward to. I would like to start this sentence with ""however"" but I'm afraid that is not the case. ""Joker"" is trying to catch sharks with bait that could merely catch a trout; the character arc that ""Joker"" try's to achieve would have possibly worked with anyone other than a DC comic book villain. It is hard to take the message in this film seriously when considering the context and who ""Joker"" is aimed at. What I'm trying to say is that ""Joker"" is a bit of a joke, it takes itself too seriously and unfortunately and I cannot help but laugh at the people who say it is a modern day masterpiece.The film opens with ""Joker"" acting bizarre and I cannot help but think that he's already lost the plot at this point: the opening scene. Yes you could argue that this is to indicate that he is an ""outsider"" not simply insane, however, after watching him brutally murder several men in the first half of the film I find this hard to believe. It appears that Joker is insane from the start so I then begin to ask myself what's the point of this film? The change we see in the main character is more of slight curve than a ""character arc"" and there is little/ no change in tone throughout.""Joker"" is incredibly unclear in its intentions and I frankly find it a struggle to get through, not because of the ""edgy"" violence but because the film is simply embarrassing compared to its many inspirations. If you take ""King of Comedy"" and take out all the good bits and replace these with scenes of violence, you will get something very similar to ""joker"". I was expecting something at least original from this film in spite of its incredible reviews but I suppose that was wishful thinking.I find psychological films simply fascinating because of their uniquely twisted characters, a great example of this is the great satirical character of Patrick Bateman from ""American Psycho"" who is portrayed in a very intriguing way that chills the viewer. ""Joker"" however, is a pretentious portrayal of a character with not much depth: he is just the joker. The same joker we saw in the dark knight, who's beauty lay in the ambiguity; we didn't need ""Joker"" to develop on this.",1
Joker,Movie without any connection to real Jocker.

You can take a random guy on the street and it will be for sure better than this skinny one, but as I said cheap.The action - sorry there is no action ... but maybe if you like a poor drama this movie is for you.The story - a cheap imitation of the comics one. Joker, as a DC character can stand Batman, and is the type of guy that can influence other not just a stupid laughter.Watch Dark Knight before this, if you think that I was to critic about this movie, and you might consider this one even worse than I described, and I overrated it.",1

Joker,No Joke.,"This is a different kind of ""superhero"" movie that has more in common with Scorcese drama and less with the faeces films of the MCU, but that doesn't mean it is actually that good.It takes itself way too seriously in a way that doesn't add any depth. The tempo is unbalanced. Phoenix does a good job, but the character is simply an impression of a violently psychotic individual, rather than an accurate portrayal. Camera, lighting and music are alright, but tedious. All in all this is a decently made, rather boring film that will mostly appeal to people with little sense of relativity and it would have been better without the comic book element.And by the way, when it comes to that comic book aspect, they completely missed the point of the character.6 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,The NRA Loves It,"A Disappointment
To begin with: pounding the square Marxist peg into the round comic book hole was probably never going to work that well.
But, if the filmmaker had been new, just starting out, I think many would have crucified him for the uneven pace of this narrative - a little bit of story - then we pause to watch Joaquin emote - then a little bit more story - then the acting - etc.
The word I'm looking for is ""turgid"".
The film moves forward in a turgid manner.
The other word at top of mind is ""lazy"".
No particular creativity. Just, again and again, the obvious - borrowing from other movies - recycling old ideas - not even really trying to synthesize something new.
I didn't find it thought provoking. I found it impatience-provoking.
And, as mentioned in my headline, if NRA TV still existed they would be running this movie in a continuous loop.
What is Arthur ""before""? A helpless clown. Pathetic and expendable.
What is Arthur ""after""? Empowered. He pushes back. He answers malice with malice, eventually becoming famous for being malicious.
And what made the change? Somebody gave him a gun.
The message of the film - from a director who makes no secret of his left-wing views - is that power comes from a gun in a unique and inevitable way.
A gun solves problems. And the obvious conclusion is that we should all be carrying one.
What kind of message is that to put in a movie?",1

Joker,Terrible let-down unworthy of comparison to better films.,"Worst movie I've seen since Black Panther, completely lacking in understanding of the difference between homage and pastiche, but then what's to expect when the director's best films include the hangover and due date. While the cinematography is well done and reminiscent of the Christian Bale Batman films, unlike those films we never actually see what it's like to live in the world inhabited by the Joker, nor are we introduced to any other character in any meaningful way which makes the (minimal) violence and general cult-worship of the Joker appear contrived and his constant sufferings seem like melodrama. It's hard to see how this Joker could possibly evolve into a criminal mastermind but then maybe the franchise is aiming to break completely with the Heath Ledger legacy which is a shame because Joaquin Phoenix obviously has the potential to up the disturbing maniac factor considerably. They could have made this a better film by increasing the level of violence Korean style and/or by dedicating way more screen time to other characters to create a more meaningful image of the society which produced the Joker. For me one of the factors which actually made the Heath Ledger Joker so memorable and disturbing was that his screen time was limited. Worth watching for movie fans who may enjoy picking it apart, but completely pointless and forgettable for anyone just looking to be entertained.",1
Joker,Not into it in the end,"Yes, the acting of Joaquin Phoenix is great, (i still like Heath Ledgers joker more) but i personally just couldn't get into the movie at all, because it is the story of a man with deep mental problems, and for me to like a movie i have to be able to relate to the main character at some level, how little it sometimes is and in this one i am totally missing that2 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Redundant,"Question: Is this Joker the same Joker from the comics, or an entirely different individual?
Answer: This Joker is a completely standalone non-canon take on the character. It doesn't tie into any existing universe.
Wait a minute, what is this then? A superhero movie? A cringe comedy? A new ""Taxi Driver"" attemp, mixed with pseudo-arthouse gimmick? Or the last serious adventure by Joaquin Phoenix to save his career?Ye olde ""HAH HAAH HAAAH HAAAAH HAAAAAH!"" laugh gets old too fast. Have you noticed that it is implied multiple times that Joaquin's character is mentally challenged throughout the movie? However they added an excrescence female character to make him not that-much-loser. A taboo mental challengement role, which was ignored by Hollywood for years but be tried done again this year. Fun to see the scenes that trying to link Batman series into this movie.Movie as a whole? Eh lets talk with clich√© words; for example: disappointment. It is said as ""brokenness of dream"" in my native language. Like when I saw the trailers and got excited, hyped; however, got disappointed by this movie ""Joker"". My expectation dreams got broken into a hundred little pieces.",1
Joker,Overrated for sure.,"This kind of movie that i was expecting it would be like for another level, which would be totally badass or totally realistic but believe, it has left me with not the actually disappointments but with the not making sense, as the trailer came out, felt really great and was hyped to see but as i watched it last night, i really didn't like it for one minute because there wasn't really a authentic scene where i was supposed to be excited or get inspired, it is just dull kind of story where things weren't matching. As i talk about Joaquin Phoenix, he did really great as with his facial expressions, his body language, his freak laughing it was real thing to see but i still didn't like the movie. I was expecting more and better kind of things but fine and good movie.In simple words: Overrated movie of the year.3 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

It's a good portrayal of someone struggling to hold a job, relationships, and their hold on reality. Phoenix's acting was wonderful in that regard. But the plot was predictable, had plot holes, and in all, this movie was not about the criminal mastermind that continuously gives Batman a run for his money. No evil genius here.

I was very disappointed. Very.
the movie everything is only two hours but went on forever ... I felt like it was over after 4 hours. I looked at the watch non-stop. So it's true that there is an Oscar for sure. No one will change that. Really exaggerated acting. But he embodies the mentally ill and the actor has lost a lot of weight = Oscar. The movie has no connection to comics for good or for bad. The references to the Wayne family are really forced. The plot is very disappointing. There are tributes here. A bit of Scorsese, taxi driver and a king of comedy , but not the same level, not the same league. There's a small tribute towards the end to the Dark Knight, wondering if you've noticed. And there's a tiny tribute to movies like Sixth Sense / Fight Club.

Joker,"I don't see this being a ""masterpiece""","I definitely don't see the hype on this movie. People are calling this a masterpiece and I definitely don't agree. They could have gotten someone much much better to play the Joker, in my opinion. If it would have came out at a different time or a different year, when there were better movies to choose from at the theater, this movie would have been considered a flop. Almost felt like each scene was never finished before jumping to the next. It also Just felt like they didn't really know how they wanted to build the character of the Joker. Just a bunch of jumbled up incomplete thoughts tossed on screen that most should have been left on the cutting room floor.

Joker,Kind of... Disappointed,"I was really excited to see this, but coming out, I felt rather disappointed. I mean, yeah, it gave us what it promised, Joker's backstory and how he descended into madness and became the Joker, but it was just... I don't know, I didn't care for how they handled it. I mean, I knew there would be some tragedy and I expected it, but I felt like they pushed that angle too much. I guess I was sort of looking for a descent into madness similar to how Jack Torrence in The Shining went crazy (minus the ghosts and supernatural) as opposed to what they did. And I'm not really sure I can even consider this a DC movie, since it had next to nothing to do with it. They could literally change the name of the Wayne family and change the name of the city from Gotham to something else, and it would have been a completely original, stand-alone, non-DC movie, that's how little involvement in it there was.But now for the big thing. Joaquin Phoenix's take on the Joker. Don't get me wrong, he did a fabulous acting job and was great for the role he was given, but that's just it, for the role he was given and the direction they took the Joker's character. But this just didn't feel like the Joker. It's like they just took some random character with a mental illness, slapped some clown makeup on him and called him the Joker. For sake of argument, lets just say they took the good Terminator from T2 and dressed him in a bat-suit then called him Batman, but he still acted like the Terminator. That's not Batman. Same here. Ok, maybe that was a bad analogy, but you know what I'm saying. This wasn't Joker. The character was far too anger, sad, pitiful, and fragile throughout the entire movie, even when he made his final ""transformation"" into Joker, it just wasn't him. Now, I know that there's never been one true, clear-cut origin for the Joker, which is part of his appeal, and those that do have one are always different, but this, I just can't see this being who was Joker beforehand or how he became Joker along the way. Parts of it, yes, but as a whole, no. One of Joker's biggest/greatest aspects is that we're all just one bad day away from completely snapping, and that life is just one big joke, so you should laugh at it. But this is just some sad, angry guy with a mental illness who has tragedy after tragedy fall upon him until he finally gives up and decides to go out with a bang while trying to take down the oppressive upper-class. That is not Joker. Again, I think Joaquin Phoenix did great for the part he was given, but like I said, I was expecting more of a Jack Torrence going crazy kind of origin as opposed to what they gave us.",1
Joker,Bland,"I didn't think much of this. Everything felt so contrived. The reasons for him going 'off it' were very forced and not very convincing. It also seems that black people don't date each other and white people don't date each other anymore in 'New Hollywood' as there was the yet again the cliched inter-relationship (got to tick those boxes). I thought the actress who played 'the bird' wasn't very good and I also found their initial relationship / attraction just wasn't believable. Again, poor writing.

I'm not a fan of the comics and I don't know all of the lore behind the Joker but this take on the character seems to me like an attempt at making something as serious and gritty as The Dark Knight without the success. There isn't much complexity to a character and story that warrants complexity.

Joker,If you build a castle in a swamp it will sink. This could have been a very good movie if the shallow plot of the Batman universe wouldn't have hold it back.,"I wouldn't want to be in the place of the director here.
The problem with this film is the realistic approach to an unrealistic world.
Batman is a childs story with many plotholes and an illogical, unrealistic universe.

Joker,The Joker and its disgustingly nihilistic perspective on humanity,"This film was essentially characterized by two things, riveting character development and the unrealistic nihilistic perspective on people. As compelling as the character development as well as the brilliant performance of Phoenix was, it was overshadowed by boring cinematography, a slow moving plot and honestly a very underwhelming film score. So when people say Phoenix carried this film, they aren't exaggerating. But the primary part of the film that frankly had me annoyed, was that it felt as if we were supposed to empathize for the Joker and his struggle to properly integrate himself into society despite the fact he was a deranged psychopath. And what brought birth to that was this very saddening and nihilistic perspective of society in which I thought was honestly quite fitting of the times.3 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Joker,Tasteless.,"Unfortunately, ""Joker"" aims to tackle extremely complex & contentious societal issues with sincerity & introspection - depicting a character's gradual descent in to villainy (not madness) through an observational gaze of impartiality - but so desperate to ensure the relatability of Joaquin Phoenix's ""protagonist"" to the viewing masses - so that audiences remain emotionally invested in his ""progression"" throughout the film, the planned ""impartiality"" is broken with the offensive mishandling & recklessly poor execution of the intended concept.Hence, what should've been a meticulous & cautious exploration in to numerous relevant & controversial problems is quickly ruined as Todd Philips tackles these significant subjects with the deft subtlety of a relentless bludgeoning to the head with a bloodied sledgehammer.What remains are the shattered fragments of the initial intention strewn across the screen as we watch the film unfold, becoming more & more grotesque - the fine line ultimately crossed, losing its sense of morality with violence being accidentally glorified thanks to the addition of questionable stylistic choices & consequently, ""Joker"" unknowingly ventures in to extremely concerning territory by carelessly excusing Arthur's actions with the tasteless justification being ""mental illness""; the result? Humanising a narcissistic monster as a ""tragic individual"" with a ""troubled past"".As a sufferer of anxiety & depression myself, I'm aware of the fact that this complacency only feeds in to harmful stereotypes (whether consciously or not) & therefore - as a result -contributes to negative public perceptions - regardless of the preliminary aim. Thus, there are consequences when you conflate mental health issues with criminality & aggressive behaviour in the media (bordering on downright fetishization) - & director Todd Philips is in a privileged enough position not to be the unlucky recipient of these sweeping generalisations he's just involuntarily validated.Of course, I'm aware this wasn't the goal of the creators but nevertheless, this will be the outcome individuals such as myself have to live with - due to their lack of conscientiousness whilst crafting & adapting a damn screenplay.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Bad reboot of Avengers: Infinity War,"OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War.

There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)CGI: Was good.Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Per For Pre Pubescent Kids,"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely.

Avengers: Endgame,Terrible Dialogue/Script and Visuals Sucked - Why the high ratings!?,"This movie was horrendous - it seems like the script was written by a 10 year old.

Avengers: Endgame,We need more 1* reviews to get the score down,"A country desperate to sell itself as a hero, together with current propaganda of misplaced feminism and diversity, Avengers is a shallow clich√© that won't be enjoyed by anybody 25 years in the future. And yet here we are, selling confusion to adolescents, regardless their age. Tell me if that slap Gamora (female) gives to StarLord (male) would be nearly acceptable if it has been the other way around?

Avengers: Endgame,I wanted to like it. I really did. But it was boring.,"If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Illogical and Convoluted,"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time.",1

Avengers: Endgame,How did they mess it up that bad? Good films for years... Until now.,"Absolutly terrible film. Endgame does not have any of the power, fights, or any part of any Marvel movie. This feels like a horrible one-off DC movie. The story could have been good but WORST follow through I have ever seen. They completely destroy The Avengers from what you have seen so far. The story is slow and seems like they didnt care at all how it ended. The fight scene is rushed and you get to see each person take one swing then they are out. Infinity Wars set up an amazing open end and Endgame ruins 10 years of Marvel films. I am no longer a fan of Marvel. Thanks for the decade long build up to this. And its the last Avengers film, at least with the ones that we know, so they can never fix it. So if youre looking for what you have come to expect from Marvel movie... Look somewhere else.76 out of 126 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,"A little less conversation, a little more action...","I have to start of by saying that i'm not the biggest Avengers fan but i really enjoyed Infinity war. I saw the movie on the new Odeon Imax theather in Oslo and i was blown away in every aspect. Not only was the 3D effects better than I had ever seen, the movie it self was awsome. I could write on and on about all the obvious reasons to why Infinity war was great one but what hit me the most was the nice pace and tempo of the movie and besides the plot worked well. Compared to Endgame which in my opinion is a very slow movie. The Avengers kept on talking and talking on and on.. and then they plotted and then they talk some more about what they where plotting. I mean the action never came. For me what makes the avengers movies good is the pace of the movies and their ability to solve problems on the go. This one didn't have that it's to stationary, to slow to whiney.
All of that though would be fine had the plot worked, but it didn't, it was to far fetched and it felt like it was rushed. They dug a hole they couldn't climbe out of. After two hours with no action i lost my patient and walked out of the theater. I'm not saying it was that bad but i just didn't feel it and i was left pretty much very dissatisfied.",1

Avengers: Endgame,"Was promised a chocolate cake, turned out to be cake of manure.","Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not.
Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation? Last one - certainly not.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Huge Let Down,"I can't believe that this was how they decided to bring to a close 11yrs of great stories, and memorable characters, esp after Infinity War left us with such a pit in our stomachs, and anxiety about what would come next for End Game.What we got was completely and utter failure, on biblical proportions, and a storyline that was made for moviegoers who want silly jokes and vivisecting plot holes that make no sense, and go nowhere.With it all tied up in an end battle scene that lasted all of 8 minutes time.I've heard people calling it ""an ode to nostalgia"", and ""a trip down memory lane at its best"".I could not disagree more, and think that the Russo Brothers really dropped the ball, BIG TIME, on a franchise, and group of characters, that have come to define a new generation of movie making, and meant so much to people world wide, over the last decade.For the last 10yrs time, marvel has given me something to be excited about when going to the movies, and something to look forward to every year, with multiple movies released per year, and new faces being added to the line up that projected its credibility & depth to higher & higher levels.21 movies, all come crashing down, in a thunderous, murderous, calamity filled mess of a 3hr movie.To say I am disappointed is an incredible understatement.Bad form, MarvelBad Form, Russo BrothersCompletely Dispicable, Disney.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"Great first half,mediocre and cheesy second half","I liked the first half a lot,there were many funny moments that worked (mainly overweight Thor and Rocket) mixed with good action. The second half turned more to the emotional side and some moments didn't make sense at all (main characters left alone by the aliens to have a heartfelt dialogue in the middle of a battle),it kept dragging on and on much like the last 20 min of LOTR return of the king making sure all main characters get a proper emotional ending.
Bottom Line : could have been the best MCU movie ever with a shorter second half and less emotional scenes. I still consider the first iron man and guardians of the galaxy the best MCU movies to date.25 out of 38 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Who is giving this movie a 10?,"I can only conclude that Disney are using bots to post 10 star ratings for this film.
Infinity War is better in every conceivable way.
I have to confess that after infinity war I had no idea how they could possibly top that.... it was going to take some great writing to turn the events of IW and create a movie that was better again.......I didn't happen.
I can't emphasize how bad I thought the story was.
It feels like a desperate attempt to conclude this saga early so they can start on the next wave.
1. You can't introduce a character as powerful as captain marvel into a fist fight.
2. Never ever ever use time travel in any movie... unless it's a comedy like bttf or hot tub.
3. Don't create scenes that make no sense just to appease the woman's movement in Hollywood...cheapInfinity war deserved so much more than this.Do yourself a favour and finish your saga with infinity war and forget this mess of a movie ever existed.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Disappointed.,"Let me first tell you that I am a big fan of the marvel movie franchise. Never read any comic book. I generally enjoy superhero movies.This review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes.
I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes.
And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable.
It was so bad that it killed all my interest in future superhero movies.16 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again.
I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much?
Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action.

So instead of another decently awesome Marvel movie they went polar opposite to Infinity War and decided to make the worst movie possible. They chose to destroy the foundation of each of the main Avenger characters and prop up the secondary characters as the heroes in order to share the screen or be politically correct or something silly like that. And can we please stop making movies about time travel. It's stupid and impossible to do correctly and impossible in general so just ditch the idea! There's a lot more I could say but it's been almost a year now and I just don't care enough to keep tearing this movie apart.

I won't spoil it but it was a rip off and a cheat infinity war was amazing 10/10 but endgame is 1/10 also just to rub salt into the wound there is no end credit cut scene so don't waste your time.... you are welcome,I can't believe the money this movie will make and it isn't even any good157 out of 293 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Highly disappointed :(,"Had a lot of expectations. But everything fizzled out. Wanted it to end after interval but friends, huh.They made the mockery of Hulk, Thor and Doctor Strange. They are damn powerful in the comic folklore but the movie ruined everything.Pro- Captain America got the limelight and am happy about that.The execution of women empowerment was not that great. Then the mantle of captain america was passed on to different character. Good that the society is learning but it should not be the case of getting money from all the sections by showing off/or what you don't have faith in.Guardians of the galaxy is far better than this. I am disappointed.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Bitterly Dissapointed,"I Invested The Last 8-9 Years in MCU Marvel Movies & TV Shows... Its Not ""All Connected"" This Was No ""Culmination Of the Entire MCU""Critical Parts Cut out of the Movie....First Half Was Utterly Dull & Boring...Turned Many Characters & Their Stotylines Into a Disgrace...Plenty Of Out of Place Jokes ...The Colours Were Awful...The Final Battle Deserves My One & Only Star...However That Final Battle Payoff Was Clearly Rushed & Felt Underwhelming... Just As i was Starting to Enjoy itI Hope the Blu-Ray / Digital Release Is An Extended Version & Shows More Focus On Other Characters...",1
Avengers: Endgame,Worst Most Over Hyped Movie in HISTORY,"This movie was TERRIBLE. First off there was NO reason for the movie to be three to four hours long... I think that was part of the strategy honestly make you think its so epic it had to be a nearly 4 hour movie.90% of the movie is just acting, trying to figure out getting the team back together, or undoing what has been done. Outside of one little battle at the end there is virtually no action in the movie at all. Additionally the action you've seen has already been seen in other movies.This is a franchise that does indeed need a complete reboot. This movie shows you how old and tired it really is. People will see it because they want to see how things end and honestly I have to give credit to the powers that be here... unlike DC they have slow cooked this movie over a decade.Iron Man is making his what 100th appearance LOL.This movie is going to be shoveled tons of money because of over hype, and because apparently its the end of the road for this group of actors.I must say however I'd hate to see anyone else playing Thor and again I'd like to see more Thor movies but that's about it.Scrub out the hype, and the franchise and tell me honestly was this movie a GREAT stand alone film? NOPE!They stretched this thing out for every single dollar. Nothing new to see here I'd skip even though you wont.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Over rated and over long.,"This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot.
Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best.123 out of 229 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

The Endgame destroys whatever marvel was building for 12 years!!!
It's a disgrace and great disrespect to all our favorite heroes who are portrayed as a parody of themselves (Thor and Hulk especially)...
This film is clearly not made for marvel fans.. Such a shame... Because for me last year's AVENGERS film was simply the best superhero movie of all time...

Avengers: Endgame,Really disappointing!!!,"I don't have to give away any spoilers to say this movie was terrible. I was so excited to see this movie. First, I have watched every superhero movie that lead to the creation of this movie. Please don't believe the critic reviews or other obviously paid for reviews. This movie was horribly boring, with very limited action. I enjoy comicbook and fantasy movies, but I also enjoy a good drama. The issue isn't that I couldn't appreciate the emotional aspect of the movie, it's simply that it was done very poorly. There were so many issues with the plot, and characters, but worst of all is a tremendous amount of pointless, long sections of uninteresting dialog. On top of this, the very few action scenes that were in the movie were really poorly done. For the most part, they were a blurry, choppy mess, and you couldn't appreciate what was happening enough to make it effective and cool. If you like movies that are boring, and try to play on your heart strings in a really contrived way, instead of being entertaining, then this is the perfect movie for you.139 out of 262 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,"Dissapointed, broken","I signed up to IMDB today just to write this. No spoilers here as I am myself a big big fan of Marvel movies. Was so looking forward to this movie but I have been dissapointed completely and feel it left me broken. I am a movie buff though dont really go to theatres to watch movies, the last one I saw in theatre was BAHUBALI 2 (Indian movie - sequel to Bahubali) and before that was 3 IDIOTS (Indian movie starring Aamir Khan). So I am very selective as which film deserve to be watched on the big screen, otherwise I just wait for the DVDs to come out. If people reading this know the 2 Indian movies I wrote about, Endgame was expected to be that level and its predecessor, Infinity War or may be even better. I dont feel the contentment I was hoping for, infact I feel like I will probably not go to theatres anymore after this has let me down. I dont want to hurt anyone's sentiments but this is my opinion (and I have the right to express my feelings so dont take it personally and me myself as a fan I feel I have been cheated). Thats all from me for MARVEL universe and the duo directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. GOODBYE.",1
Avengers: Endgame,No Justice for this Film,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations.",1
Avengers: Endgame,A terrible end to 2.3 phases of great movies,"Easily the worst MCU movie even worse than Ragnar√∂k, with ita only redeeming qualities being a beautiful, though rushed, ending to the first arc of the MCU and the occasional moment of heartfelt nostalgia.Instead of delivering on any of the setup from the last movies, e.g. the unresolved conflict from Civil War and pulling a The Last Jedi, they veered off into a trip down memory lane and threw out any kind of internal logic in order to so, with the result being that most of movie feels like filler.Further in analogy to TLJ they chose to undercut almost every emotional scene with terrible comedy and they turned characters such as Thor and Hulk, who had almost recovered from their excruciating treatment in Ragnar√∂k, into caricatures of their Avengers 1 glory.I almost could not bear remaining in the cinema until the last few minutes of mostly genuine emotion.",1

Avengers: Endgame,From the expected fantastic nothing,"If the film is viewed as a separate film then it is excellent in every respect, but since that is not the case then the film is mildly said to be a failed case. First I missed it with infinity war. A lot of mistakes that were not allowed to happen. Hulk, who during the whole series of avengers is unbeatable and who is beaten more and more becomes stronger and stronger, he is the greatest weakman, and also the vision that at that moment was the most powerful member of their family. I can understand that Tanos was extremely dominant about the stones, but the fact that the person who wrote the script was a lot of work, and then they made so many illogicalities that do not happen in children's films, for such a film is extremely bad. Then hopes fell on the end game. Hoping that at least a portion of these errors will be corrected and made a much better film that follows all the previous happenings in the entire series of Avenger, Iron Men, Torah ... did not happen. The opposite happened. They made many more errors than they could ever make. I'll only include a couple of extreme errors. The first who watched the Guardians of the Galaxy meant that then it was said that no mortal can hold infinity stones, let alone use it, and here they played with them as with clicks. Suddenly, the captain of America becomes the god of lightning, is it realistic that you did it, and after all, I do not know why Tanos needed stones at all when he threw them out of stone as a toy, if we already found out that the hula was beaten because he had a stone at that time power, what did he have now? Again I emphasize the film about the special effects and from the technical side fantastic and that it is completely separate from me would get a grade 10. This way, on my part, it can only get a score of 1.",1

Avengers: Endgame,"Not a 1, more like a 7...","But I want to try to bring the rating down because it does not deserve to be ranked among such movies as The Godfather and Twelve Angry Men.Ill start by saying the movie starts off really strong. Whenever you're dealing with time travel, there's it almost always going to end up messy. There's about a 45 minute stretch in here where the film isn't really coherent, and the way they choose to cover that is by distracting us with a humor, literally a joke every 10 seconds. After a certain point, the movie gets a lot better during the second half.Not as good or as tightly written as infinity war. I think everyone is raving over this movie because it's the end of the marvel franchise, and they did a good job at wrapping everything up. It is no where near one of the ""best movies of all time"" like everyone is saying.106 out of 199 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,How Marvel Killed all the heros that mattered,"Waited for the endgame ever since I left the theatre after infinity war. I really wanted to enjoy the movie, I even cheered for all the cliche stuff that was shoved in the film as what you would call fan service. But what the writers did to the fans was really disrespectfull. They wrote off all the heroes whose contract is done with marvel in the most rediculous way possible. Oh make hulk all green , sacrifice black widow for no reason, make captain America old, uselessly old, and please don't get me started on the unnecessary killing of Iron man the God father of the what so called Marvel Cinematic universe. They wanted us to give up Our old heroes to make way for their new ones, but just because we are fan they can manipulate us the way they want, but just because we are fans this is the one thing we won't do. It's not easy for a fan to let go of his hero and move on. We deserve a better end than that, their heroes deserve a better end than that insult. For heaven sake even Loki deserve a better ending than that. As a fan I was ready to allow all the none sense the story had, but insult me and take away my favorite hero and I will eat you alive. I will allow the whole concept of time travel thing, but let's go through the logic they had to fix everything. They would go back in time and steal the stones from different timelines bring them to the future snap their fingers bring everyone back, okay after that it gets stupid they will return the stones back right when they took them, wait won't that be putting the stones for Thanos to take again in his own timeline to snap his fingers and repeat the loss AGAIN. Why wouldn't they just go to the past destroy one of the stones once and for all. That would have at least saved black widow. Why would iron man snap his fingers why didn't he use the power of the stones and kicked Thanos ass at least that would have given us the satisfaction of revenge. How did Thanos get all the pym particles to get almost all his planet on earth through time travel in quantum realm when the avengers themselves had only enough for ONE ROUND TRIP. Where did the Asgardians come from. Didn't Thanos destroy their whole ship in the start of infinity war. How did the valkirey get her white horse for heaven sake have some respect for our heads and what good did the flying horse do really Nothing. Why make Thor this miserable and useless, that's not fair to his fans at least, why give him 5 minutes chat with his mother when it does nothing to his morals or affect the story at all. Same for the starks father son meeting absolutely meaningless. Where was Thor and iron man when Thanos beat the hell out of captain America, sleeping ?!! The end fight scene was terrible in the least. Single fight no unity at all even though they were all there and what became of Thanos they did better fighting him when he had the stones now that he is without them he becomes invincible why?!! Just to kill away Iron man?!! And don't get me started on the boring out of context gay conversation captain America has with an unknown and why he gives his shield to falcon just because he is black, leaving Baky his almost brother behind. The girl power scene was crab and too imposed. Spider man comes back after 5 years to find his friends still at high school ?!!! You ruined it all Marvel ,you destroyed my 11 years of entertainment with a really horrible ending that just serves you and not the dedicated fans whom made this possible for you.

Felt like it was written to only care about Captain America & Hawkeye. There are very few cool moments because it leaves you confused & wanting answers to the new plot holes.

Avengers: Endgame,Beyond Boring,"I was so excited to see this movie. 1.5 hours later I walked out from sheer boredom. First movie I have ever walked out of. If it was a normal length feature, I would have suffered through the whole thing, but knowing I have another 1.5 hours to go made me want to cry in misery. I left my husband and ran errands ... THAT is how boring it was.Boredom aside, there were so many eye rolling moments that left me surprised with the praise this movie received. AND if you have ever studied physics and the theories of time travel ... I'd suggest you do yourself a favor and leave this for the flat earthers.65 out of 121 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,All of you people were high when you watched this.,"This one star review is necessary to bring you sheep back to reality. This movie was a boring mess and a major letdown. Infinity War was far better, and that isn't saying much. All of these Marvel films except for a handful out of the 22, 23, however too many have been made-have the same feel by the time credits roll. The MCU's true legacy is showing how if a studio can keep audiences laughing, they'll shut their brains off and ignore the inanity (inanity not insanity, clarification for the lemmings) in front of them.103 out of 199 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Most overrated film of all time,"This wasn't just bad as in disappointing, it was one of the worst films I've ever endured. I was enjoying it until 'time travel', and from then on it spiralled downwards until it hit rock bottom. Just terrible.
You know how Iron Man 3 was unwatchable? Well imagine that, but a hundred times worse and even longer.
It amazes me how someone, at some point, gave this the green light to be made and then wasted $350million on this disaster.
It's difficult to know where to start with this insufferable abomination, but I guess it must just be me as it made a ton of money at the box office and seems to get decent reviews.
If this is an indication of the standard of where the Avengers movies were heading, then good riddance. The proof in what I'm saying is the appallingly bad 'Spider-Man Far From Home', which is also one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see.
I give it one star for the last 20 minutes where the series was wrapped up.

Avengers: Endgame,NOt for Comic Lovers,"I remember when HULK movie came with Eric Bana featuring and after Edward Norton came as a HULK replacing him, after seeing those movies there was nothing on my mind a bunch of superheroes and villains will appear along with HULK. Not to mention The Fantastic Four. When I saw those movies i am very much satisfied not very too much of people gathering around for one cause and will be fighting for it. Separate character in a individual timeline satisfied me in all way. When Iron Man movie released , hey there comes an another guy.. and i seriously swear i thought this will be like previous movies. Instead Nick Appears in the post credit scene in the second part of Iron Man . Even Tony Stark appears in post credit scene in the Incredible hulk movie speaking to the General guy in a bar, i thought two geniuses are gonna do something, but that was just left there and these screenwriters comes up with a gigantic story from Iron Man 2 movie they think they can handle it. did they ? or they are too amateur to handle it ! thinking of they would have taken care of in a better way instead they rushed it in a way to end it like an ending which we all seen in porn movies.Expression was quite opposite way...",1

Avengers: Endgame,Meh,"Not a full review cause I don't feel like doing one.Endgame was fine. It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel clich√© you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural .

Avengers: Endgame,HILARIOUSLY BAD,"NO SPOILERS AHEAD, just an honest review from someone who makes a living working in the film and television industry.ENDGAME had a daunting task of following up arguably the greatest MCU film of all time so I can appreciate the Russo's even attempting it but that being said this film's master plan was poorly executed. Ranging from poor character development to lazy writing along with multiple plot holes and obvious continuity errors that should not have gone unnoticed (shame on you, scripty) the film was just..... A let down. A tremendous let down.Things to do instead of watch this movie:
1.) Rearrange your sock drawer
2.) Call that aunt that used to gift you batteries as a kid but no toys to put them in
3.) Mow your lawn. Even if it's freshly cut you would still be better off mowing it again than going to see this nonsense.",1

Avengers: Endgame,What a complete let down,"Whilst the visual effects are the highlight, this film did not delight or live up to the fantastic setup from Infinity War.The pace is off, the characters are painfully not funny or behave in ways which have been set out in the previous 21 movies.I have enjoyed TV series finales more than this. It was a huge undertaking to get to this point and generally the previous films were good, this for missed the mark.In Infinity War when Spiderman met his demise - that was a touching moment, this film cannot recreate that at all, I found the emotional scenes more amusing than sad or emotive.I do not want to write spoilers for the movie so that is all I can say but this for me was the worst MCU movie to date.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Horrible ending for a long series.,"I can only agree with Martin Scorsese. This isn't cinema. It is worse than watching a documentary.
The whole saga was drawn out for so long, with just awkward feeling movies, and a pitiful ending.
If you think this movie is good, go watch a real movie, like The Godfather or Dark Knights trilogies. If you make more than 3 movies in a franchise, the quality will be just as bad, if not worse than the Fast and Furious series.12 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Infinity War's poorer brother,"I always thought it was going to be almost impossible to improve on Infinity War... and I think I've been proved right.
This was always going to be a film all about how the good guys could return to winning ways after getting their proverbial @as kicked in infinity war.
Yes we probably wanted to see some of the aftermath of half the universe being wiped out....but it didn't need to play out for so long.
To be honest I dislike most films when time travel becomes involved...I just think it all becomes a bit ""well nothing really matters as we'll just go back in time and change it"".
I've watched infinity war 8 times already... but i just can't imagine ever sitting through this that many times.
My honest opinion is it's too long....some of the main characters are just either disappointing or none existent.
Another issue..if you have a character as powerful as Captain Marvel the rest of the squad become a bit redundant...unless you a again decide to send her to the other side of the universe.
Some people will kid themselves that this is the peak of the whole journey.....its not...it already happened in infinity war.33 out of 66 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,Just bad!,"Nearly 1000 reviews two days after the release, so you just need the basic information without spoilers.It's in my opinion the worst marvel movie I've seen and I've seen all except for the captian marvel movie. I loved the previous avengers movie, which I rated 8 out of 10. I was looking forward to the movie and got disappointed big time.Endgame is slow. I mean really slow. The first 2,5 h you barley see a action scene. It's full of plot holes, which make the movie unbelieveable. I know its fiction but that doesn't mean you can cut all the logic and get away with it. The plot itself was very predictable but there was not much plot left when you take the jokes and the fanservice away. The antagonist was reduced to the absolute minimum. Infinity War build Thanos as the best and complex villain in the MCU, just to turn him into a one dimensional world destroyer. They alter their characters in parodic ways. Some may find it funny but not me. The humor is also a big factor. Infinity War had funny moments but this was a absolute gatling gun fire of unnecessary jokes and none of them hit. The jokes were overdone and they rode the dead horse many times which lead me to hide my face behind my hands for most of the time. Maybe it's just not my kind of humor.Sooooo...3h of my lifetime I can't get back. It felt wasted. I was bored, angry and torn between sleeping in the chair or just walking out the cinema.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Comedy maybe a few laughs at most.,"Good god what were the writers thinking. back to the future meets avengers?

I was never bored because that is what this movie needs.Slow pacing and build up to an 2nd act and 3rd act of insanity.The characters are not just characters they are very human here ,so vulnerable and full of mixed emotions. The action scenes were really good and this movie is just pure enjoyment and will easily be in my top 5 favorite mcu movies but not better as Infinity War in terms of being a movie.(for me)and surprisingly Captain Marvel is better here than in her own solo movie and this movie is more emotional than Infinity War.Because two movies are presenting different emotions for it's audience to feel.This movie is such a beautiful experience.23 out of 48 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,High expectations,"Russo Brothers gave the GENERAL audience exactly what they wanted. I would've not changed a thing to make the money they did. But if I had the talent of a Martin S. or Christopher N. this would have been better than infinity war (which was amazing!!). Cookie cutter storyline with untimely comedy. Too much comedic relief with poor dialogue and horrible storyline. Thanos seems to be a typical bad guy whereas in infinity war there was much depth to him...you could almost sympathize with him. A lot of Easter eggs if you like them. If youre a sheep you will love this movie. If you think for yourself and looking for a rich cinematic storyline that can keep you focused, this film would give the same enjoyment as Toy Story1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,"Terrible story, amazing finale","The first 2 hours were extreemly prolonged, and i couldn't get engaged in the story what so ever.

Avengers: Endgame,"Starts slow, but eventually picks up pace","NOTE: I've seen every film, and tv show in the MCU (a lot), so that's just to confirm that I'm not one of this reviewers that rip apart the film because they don't understand the importance or meaning behind it.The first 2 hours are very slow, and what happens is predicatable at times which is the exact opposite of what I was expecting, it sometimes gets a bit boring, not to mention Fortnut in 5 years still being a thing!However, there are lots of fan pleasing moments in the first 2 hours and a few giggles which lightens the mood which was good, and I LOVE the way Steve was portrayed in this film, it was awesome. The sad moments were sad, and the fun moments were fun, they did their job.The plot was very interesting in the fa t that we, as the ultra fans, were brought back in time on a nostalgic journey though our past memories of this amazing franchise. But sometimes the time travel aspect of it went a bit on, and kept on going when i thought we saw enough of it.Then the final hour of the film comes in, and it was EPIC. Once again Cap was unbelievable, best part of the film by a mile, Tony was the same old Tony that we know and Love, and he was rightfully the one to end it all. However I didn't feel as saddend as I thought I would be about Tony at the end, I just felt glad that he was the one to end it, and the funeral at the end was not as AMAZING as I expected, as this was the most relevant character in the most relevant franchise of all time, and passed away. Having watch both seasons of Agent Carter I found Caps ending severely heartwarming.Overall, this film stayed off slow and average but eventually it was abosolutly stunning, but a few slightly disappointing little things near the end that don't really bother me.I would say that Infinity War was better, as there was ZERO cons for me, and this has quite a few and Infinity War left me with no regrets in terms of directors' decisions.2nd best MCU film imo, ABSOLUTELY STUNNING FILMAlso, when Doctor Strange released all the superhero's to fight, I was really hoping the guys from the tv-shows would be there amongst them all, that would be perfect.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Incredibly dull finale of an amazing franchise,"The great thing about the Avengers-Franchise has always been this winning scheme:1. A range of very different characters like Thor, Spidey and Strange, clashing together in witty and funny dialogues that showcases just how different they are. Spidey cracking jokes about deep philosophic insights of Strange, while Thor asks about beer.2. Incredible fight scenes3. Both may be linked by a variety of different narrative elements, from film-noir/detective over comedy to splatter.It's an easy base recipe, that may be filled with any narrative strings, so long as they are intriguing.Problem with the Avengers movies and the finale in particular is:The winning scheme is NOT used and the narrative underlying is poor, at best.They picked parts of a variety of comics (like the ""Thor get's irresponsible and fat""-plot), which is ok and linked them very poorly together. It's a series of short plots, loosely tied together with no red line (other than ""Thanos is the Endboss"").Secondly, the acting is poor, apart from Iron Man of course! Even Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanssen do a really bad job at depicting their character. The digitally animated raccoon is a highlight in terms of acting.There is only ONE AVENGER-TYPICAL FIGHTSCENE, which is great, but does not make up for the rest.Foot-Note: As a Non-American, the Glory-Halleluja-Murica focus on Cap is too much. If you're patriotic enough, you'll love it, of course.",1

Avengers: Endgame,A complete hype,"I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years.275 out of 490 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward.

Avengers: Endgame,"boring, bored, boredom - what a mess of a movie","What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't.

The CGI is great, I enjoyed it very much. But the best part of the movie was a trailer before. There is still hope in this modern world. ""Bad Boys"" are still black and still as brilliant as in 2009. I'm looking forward to watching them again.43 out of 68 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it.

Avengers: Endgame,Neither self-contained nor original,"The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past.

I was ready for a simple popcorn flick, but this movie committed the worst crime of all; it was horrendously boring.This film had zero depth, the characters were two dimensional, and the jokes mostly fell flat for me. The actors looked bored, and at times there was more green screen than the Star Wars prequels. Worse still, there were times where it felt like certain actors weren't even on set at the same time as the others, and it was all edited together afterwards.I wish I had the infinity glove so I could click my fingers and cut this movie by 50% of its runtime.81 out of 152 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

The positive reviews of this film have me convinced that professional reviewers, pod-casters and tv/youtube talking heads are being paid for favorable reviews. I'd hate to sound like a conspiracy minded person but...
During the 3 hours in a sold-out theatre I barley heard a chuckle as most of the jokes fell flat, rare for a marvel movie. The end garnered no applause, also rare for an event movie like this. So many characters are minimized or just poorly written. For the record I loved Infinity War.

Avengers: Endgame,At a complete loss for words,"Never in my life have I left a review on here however I felt obligated to after sitting through three hours of absolute nonsense. The film began an I was just at a loss for words, it felt like a practical joke. However I held out hope that it would get better, it didn't, it got worse. The way some of these beloved characters have been portrayed in this film literally made my toes curl up in embarrassment, it's absolutely shocking. Lazy writing, and beyond anti climactic. I've seen so many 10/10 reviews on here I'm half convinced the film I seen was actually a joke and all these other people got to see a completely different film than I did.
I had so much hope for the Russo Brothers to make this a truly spectacular film and I didn't think it would be possible for them to mess up this bad. I had tickets to go and see it a second time later on today however I'd rather lose the money and not go than sit through it again.

Avengers: Endgame,Made with a deft hand,"How can we take insignificant uninteresting stuff and make it awesome stuff because this flick has loads of characters and you may or may not like the premise of the jeweled glove and having to stop Thanos' destruction. Do you like that premise? To make awesome from awesome is something but un awesome into awesome something else to do. First the bad is it has too much melodrama with faces filling the screen in different emotive expressions to bring more ""important"" to everything. It's like the Looney Tunes episode of opera singing with Bugs, Elmer Fudd, wearing helmets with little wings, and a fat white horse, the type that of helmet that Thor wears too. Never into this episode because I like FUN. Or like the symbol of acting, the frowning face and the smiling face so I get there's an audience for this that I'm not for. The other thing is referencing other movies in here. Some of the references people might not even like, numerous time traveling flicks mentioned, Hot Tub Time Machine, Terminator, BTTFuture, Time Cop, Bill and Ted, even in Cap: Civil War I recall Empire Strikes Back which I thought the same thing but didn't think there would be way more in this movie by the makers, as some may not even like some of those movies. This isn't a tv show, but a movie, it sounds like something people you're around would say, not actual characters in the movie. Thirdly there's too much sentimental domestic stuff rearing itself with too much ""family"" shyt , little kid crap, YAWN. This was a problem in Captain Marvel in the mid part in some shack remeeting an over emoting lady friend and her tyke, I was expecting Cap Marvel to present some tampons to her to ease her, or even the Skrulls wearing sweaters to make it cuter. These are space warriors in the comics, for Pete sakes. This is off the top of my head. In Endgame what I'm talking about is perfectly shown in one scene out of nowhere this happens: this guy is sitting on a front porch (I get he's from Iron Man but others may not have seen that) and his tyke says she wants cheeseburgers. ""You can have all the cheeseburgers you want, cheeseburgers, all of them,"" paraphrased, while spacing out having a sedated appearance, and this just cuts to another different scene. What the?!?!?? Geezers sitting on front porches, thanks movie. This encapsulates why this domesticated crap is crap.Now the good stuff is this is funny af (af acronym was actually on some billboard recently kid you not) moments from Thor, a delightful chap, who's taken the spotlight a lot recently after being in the shadow in the early MCU, the opening scenes from Guardians is reshown from a diff perspective of like Starlord doing the same walkman listening and miming motions while the current superheroes spying on him hilariously. The revisiting of other Marvel movie scenes kind of work like from Thor: Dark World, Avengers 1, Cap: Winter Soldier. Dark World domestic scene works because it's around palace intrigue and I like the vibrance of that movie being the first MCU movie I saw. And also the elevator scene from Winter Soldier is reduxed in a funny way, and the Battle of NY from Avengers 1 also. The other thing is a fight sequence between Thor, Cap, Iron Man against Thanos which is impressive wow. It's here that it also shines. I think these other MCU scenes with a different spin are kinda cool, although I would have liked just to introduce its own thing this movie. I mean you don't see in Avengers 1 them resisting scenes from their solo movies. I know that they want to get this Thanos storyline out of the way though naturally and the whole story is just like the comics pretty much verbatim. Personally I'm ambivalent about that storyline frankly. I actually appreciate the movies that takes an insignificant plot and make something out of it.But you know the good thing is these movies present loads of interviews, panel conferences, and those global cast events that are so entertaining to watch so ti's a win win. Wondering what is the key to happiness for all of those in those interviews. In Fractured Fairytales they say ""the happiest people are busy people"" but that's not quite, it's those who value their masculine and feminine (guys former and women latter obv.) It seems the doorways just open for those type of people, and the busy people-an illusion. I've worked so much and study and the doorways , are they flying open. It's these in these interviews, Scarlett who knows how to be feminine, Brie has a slight masculine to her and you see why people are like what the?? Cap Marvel movie people are not taken with that, it takes place like 2 decades ago and now men have to sit in theater who were around then and have to watch this smarmy lady onscreen, what does this tell you. Gwyneth Paltrow is another masculine, why is she here, the song in stores ""turn your magic on/I feel alive again"", you like that? She was with that guy until he's like no I don't want to deal with this masculine person I just want to make more songs forget this. I don't know the correlation between busy and this m/f thing I just know if you are too much in one it's OK to balance it out with the other thing to keep fun. I j/o every other day. Anyway so the movie has Thor hammer it up, Hulk smashes, Hawkeye lays some serious deep stick arrow, Black Widow looks spiderific, Iron Man unleashes blasts, and Cap just goes in raw.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Not as i expected,"I had such big expectations for this movie and i was so anxious to see it that in the past two weeks i kept dreaming and thinking about it every day. But, unfortunetly, the movie dissapointed me pretty much. I really like the Ruso brothers and they have had great imagination and are good at what they do, but this movie was casted and filmed in a hurry with little to almost no action at all and lack of inspiration and imagination. They could have done a much better job with the Endgame movie but i guess that is what happens when you rush to make even more money and don't care much about the fans.
Hope they make it up to us with their next movie.9 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Massive snooze fest,"I like the way all the plots come together to please the Marvel nerds, but geez it's boring. It reminded me of star wars 2 (or was it 3?) just loads and loads of abysmal cgi. Smashing, punch, zapping. Lots of creatures, lots of people running around. I watched it over 3 nights, it was that shallow. Unlike some films you can't stop, this made me doze of. They must've spent the budget on the cast and left none for story or cgi. Some of the characters were so forgetful I don't even know who they are. Who's the guy that looks like jesus? who's the lady that has red glowing hands?

This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy.

Avengers: Endgame,Skip the first 2 hours,"There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4. This is super likely.I heard Spider Man: Far From Home was really really good, but I have no desire to see it. Why? Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Mediocre,"Before you embark on a journey to watch this way-too-long movie remember that the time spent doing this cannot be recovered. You will not be able to go back in time and undo this.
Thor is, as always, well played and funny. Hulk is pretty decent and that's about it. Story is not interesting at all. Too many pointless dialogues that go on and on with no message whatsoever. The main idea behind the movie seems to be to let the guys do something, pack as many faces on screen as we can and, as long as there are explosions and some colorful CGI, it will be fine. There is no depth, no cohesion to the story.

There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on.

Avengers: Endgame,an elephant gave birth to a mouse..,"I am sort of sorry that the rares time I write a review, it is not a kind one.
But I am sorrier still that the rares times I watch theater movies, it is because of high ratings of previous reviewers.Yep, that is how i chose this one.""Astonishing"", ""perfect"", ""masterpiece"", ""9 out of 10"" were some of the comments and ratings around, so I thought, this must be it, if I have to see one movie this year, it's this one.But honestly :Special effects, are good.Plot is so plain you understand what is going to happen and how it is going to end in the first ten minutes. And there are no twists whatsoever.
Everything is pretty much recycled from other movies - not talking about ""avengers"" or marvel series; rather, just any SF movies out there were used as ideas sources to fill this one. Nothing new, nothing different.Yeah, there are a few nice jokes, and some fat, both so badly plugged you can see the stitching (you'll understand when you see it). In the past, when heroes were making jokes during a battle, it was to show they mastered the situation, and it was fitting the atmosphere and pace; in this one, you can see at some point the director absolutely wanted to put a joke in the middle of the main battle - broke the rythm and half spoiled the mood just because of that.Movie is three hours long.I just watched two episodes of an old anime series from the 80's, and in those 46 minutes, there was pretty much as much action and stuff going on than in these almost-three-hours of medium paced show. So although people say it was needed to fit all the references to previous marvel movies, i'd rather have less references and more things happening in this one.As it often happens in these follow-ups, previous movies created such an intricate situation that this one solved in such a straight-forward way, it felt as if somebody wanted it rushed to the finish.And in order to do that, it took the party of a lousy quantum physics theory (which is actually wrong, btw), and left some important side question unansweredAnd not to talk about the mania from the producers to destroy stuff that went on for d√©cades, or millennia, all in the timespan of a few years! We had ragnarok, the death of Odin.. And now.. this?
Well without spoiling the movie for those that want to see it, I'd say it looked like they wanted to make sure that this put an end to the story. Even if that meant to break the logic of these movies : ""Thus far and no further we shall make avengers movies""
God complex, perhaps?All in all, it wasn't any better than an old Flash Gordon movie, except for the SFX that are of course more modern. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, as 1 and 2 are reserved for movies that don't deserve watching till the end.
But I believe that once the paid comments and the avengers mania will be past, many other will downrate this, that definitely did not deserve all that advertising and praise it received so far.Definitely a cash movie, nothing more.",1

Avengers: Endgame,"Shaky Plot, Shaky Direction and Shaky Camerawork in need of a Steady Hand","When the focus is on a few characters, this film shines but the overall focus is blurry-literally and metaphorically. I'm not kidding. Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild.30 out of 47 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,1.5 hour movie made 3 hour movie,"The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h.
If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel.30 out of 47 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,3 stars dissapointment,"If you kept away from spoilers and you purchased your ticketto go see the long waited Endgame...well, you will might end up after 3 hours of watching it, just like me, dissapointed. I know I was! What a mess !
Of course it is intended to patch screenplay holes up, or cut ties with actors that are no longer part of the franchise... But , I mean, come on!
Some of the make-up effects are just terrible, and yeah it is a very important Avenger with a very disturbing beard and wig to begin with!
Plot, caracter developement, lines, ughh...my expectations dissapeared, you know, snap of fingers!

Avengers: Endgame,Very wasteful,"Well. Went to see it opening night and came out so disappointed. Was reading reviews when going in (without the spoilers) that were so great only to be hugely disappointed!!! No spoilers in this review as none are really necessary. To much time on empty characters (Hawkeye), way to long to bring back the half that are gone so most of the movie was wasted with slow plots that will be destroyed in the end. The captain ending is stupid. How many holes are there now!!! And boring hulk!!!! Why???? Infinity war was on a different level and this just fell off from the beginning. I felt like when I watched the NEW Star Wars movies. Total waste and let down. I think they forgot what got them this far and just caved to making the almighty dollar in the end.35 out of 56 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Epic fail,"Watched this on first day of opening. I was holding really high hopes, based on Infinity war, and i was really dissapointed. This movie has some good parts, and im ok with the final result, but the journey there was bad and really messed up. In general the whole movie felt like the main story is a couple of actors (and here i really mean actors, not theirs fictional characters) saying goodbye to marvel and mcu. Infinity war, Thanos, infinity stones, fate of universe, etc, seems just like a minor side story. Very, very sad waste of 3 hours.65 out of 118 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,"An average movie, worth watching but not more","Story and the plot are the foundation of any movie and this film isn'tr very well in that matter. of course much superhero movies are like that however.It is obvious that we can expect things that are not rational compare to real world in sci-fi or fantasy movies so we measure them in compare to their own introduced logic. we accept some basic unnatural things and then we follow the new rules. Based on the rules the marvel universe has introduced us previously, End Game has too many holes. characters suddenly get very stronger than what they were seconds before or in compare to their history with no reason. Time traveling bugs like in all other time traveling movies present here as well. this happens also to emotional relationships between them. movie has too many cliche scenes with boring dialogs.when we compare this one to Infinity war, it is a huge disappointment. However, it is still worth watching and if you are a fan of Sci-fi, it entertains you. It is just an average superhero movie.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Not for kids.,I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one.

Avengers: Endgame,"This may have the quickest turn around for any ""remake"" in history. Coupled with Infinity War it is the low point of the MCU","Several of the narrative problems that are present in Infinity War are not resolved or made worse by this remarkably lazy film. Of note, Thanos' ideology is both utterly incoherent and utterly alien to the Zeitgeist. The writers simply lacked the courage to make Thanos into the eugenicist that he so clearly should be. Without that edge to him he is a scene chewing comic book *villain* in the worse way. I simply did not care about the plot because the villain is a snidely whiplash joke. The film doubles down on the idiocy present in Infinity War as Thanos' end goal is just more so. This problem renders the film hollow, emotionally inert.That might have been overlooked if the film's overall structure wasn't, more or less, identical to Infinity War. Starting at about 30 minutes in the two films run remarkably in parallel with each other. The pieces are slightly jumbled and certain characters end up playing different beats but act to act, sequence to sequence, scene to scene the underlying scaffolding of the plot is the same. This would be better if the plotting wasn't redundant in the first place. Infinity War boiled down to 6 color coded chase scenes over MacGruffins. The same is true in Endgame but even more so. The plot device introduced to allow the team a fighting chance produces whole manners of plot contrivances, incoherence and murky what the heck is happening. There are 21 other films in the series and while I have seen every single one (some more than 3 times!) I simply don't have the convoluted metaphysics memorized. If you saw each film once in the theatre as they were released parts of this mess will confuse you.On that note the Infinity Stones are even more MacGruffins in this film as Endgame doesn't even bother to try to visualize their various powers. Infinity War turned magick users into mere boxers and this film continues to lower the bar for imaginative use of space magick. I still don't understand what the difference between, say, the space stone and reality stone is practically. There is nothing in the film that demonstrates their powers. This adds to the rote laziness that the film embodies.Inevitably in a film like this a few characters will get short changed. This happened here to my favorite character. For a film that so copied its predecessor's structure I am gobsmacked that not all re-matches occurred in the action scenes. Some of them do, but a pretty obvious and possibly entertaining one doesn't. On top of that the final moment-key to a character and the plot- is overly telegraphed due to the extraordinary amount of time spent with said character and the seeming checklist they have for a farewell tour. The balance is wrong for the character relationships. You can more or less guess the consequences based on screen time.None of the consequences of the two films seem final, abet textually a few of them are (I guess). Capital being what it is Disney would never kill off a bunch of Golden Geese; it was always faintly absurd the two films pretended otherwise. This narrative holdover from Infinity War takes a lot of heat out of the film.There are a few nice quips. There are also some promising team up moments in the film that point to brighter days. But in the end this is navel gazing nonsense.",1
Avengers: Endgame,You would you even make Thor a dummy comedian?,A big disappointment for Thor fans. Intentionally made him dummy and useless.

Avengers: Endgame,Just another superhero movie,"SO many reasons to love this movies but so many more to just completely hate it. I mean, how many times can you just do whatever you like in a movie and have to explain it in the movie that it is okay because of this reason. What a joke. Also, the movie felt like a mixture of ten percent of ten different movies mixed into one and was just not fun to try to follow. In fact, after the most boring first hour in moviedom history, the movie just started to do stuff that felt like it was filmed before the story was even written or a script in hand. And please dont get me started on the Hulk, I wont spoil anything but will say that it was not a pleasure watching him become the weakest Avenger. This movie should have been cut down to about two hours - it would have still blown chunks but at least it wouldnt have been a sleepy third hour. The movie makes me wish that movies offered satisfaction guarantees and returns. I wouldnt have returned any of the snacks but I would have asked for my ticket money back. It stank. And finally, the biggest let down was the acting - these people get paid loads of money and their acting is stilted and boring. Well, enough - I must be wrong as it is making so much money. Sorry, don't see it.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Boring recycled plot,"I am quite amazed at the lack of original content in this movie.They manage to recycle about 50% of infinity war into this movie. Isn't that just lazy?They could have easily cut 1 hour of meaningless content and add 15min of explaination for the random things that happen with no context.They road mapped the movie in the first 15min so no real surprises.Acting was good. Special effects were good. I liked the David character, surprisingly 'natural'.Also Hoyts NZ - survey who likes your recliner seats - I think you might be surprised it's < 50%.I wish I had spent my money on a creative original movie, rather than a super hero tribute movie.I am not entertained.",1
Avengers: Endgame,The most expensive Fortnite advertisement,"Just when you think that they couldn't make a movie worse than Doctor Strange, they throw this at you. It's an action move that tries too hard, way too hard to be complex, and then fails at it spectacularly.Ignore the terrible attempts at humor, and the extremely useless first hour, even then it felt way too long. It's not like the cast is bad, there are good actors in there, but either they are never utilized or are given such flimsy characters that I don't know who I hated more; the actor for taking that role or the character for being that bland.Oh and the more-than-obvious-from-a-million-light-years-away attempt of shoving feminism and racial equality down your throat. It looks awful and felt like they were making fun and not supporting it. Like they wanted to cover all bases and earn the most points, from their grandest money-cow. Absolutely ridiculous!Also the video game ad? It's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty all over again.And the story? Well, there's no point to it. It's filler and mainly builds up to that ending that too was underwhelming and had nothing unique anyway.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Way way overated! Boring and ordinary. Its popularity is inexplicable,"I read the user reviews before I saw this movie. I thought perhaps the negative reviews were a bit unfair. But no! The cinema was filled to the max- I have never seen this before! Today's paper reported it is the highest grossing movie in history! Why? The audience were enraptured, laughing at seemingly unfunny moments, and cheering when good guy characters emerged. I think everyone drank the kool aid!
Most of the movie is ordinary and just like other Avenger movies. Special effects were used to insert characters in cameo roles. Nothing new here folks!
I have tried to analyze its popularity and have concluded that it is really simple to please the masses. People dont want complex scifi, a simple good- bad guy formula with a touch of routine comedy, good looking actors made more attractive with special effects touch ups, and some character familiarity will do the trick. Throw in a lot of multicultural references and political correctness and voila! Big bucks.61 out of 114 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,Not The Classic Ending You'd Expect,"I went to this movie expecting a lot, given both the hype/build up it had received and the absolutely amazing predecessor in Infinity War last year.What I got however, was more questions than answers. The plot was weak at best and the storytelling was absolutely awful. The pace of storytelling was almost uncomfortable to watch at points. Infinity War very cleverly managed to give some real key characters decent screen time and dialogue, Endgame failed at this, massively. And the evolution of some characters in this film (Thor and Hulk) was laughable. Add o this, the film definitely did NOT need to be 3 hours long. It could quite easily have fitted into a 2-2.5 hour slot quite easily, they definitely hung out the wrong areas of the story for too long and for me personally, focusing on the wrong elements of the story.I really am disappointed that the culmination of 22 films led to such a disappointing end, especially with the promising lead up Infinity War offered.",1

Avengers: Endgame,DOWNGRADE after very good Infinity War,"Dont get me wrong, i know 99% of the reviews are from marvel/avengers fans but hey im not blame you all youre are blind and marketing from producers swept you down. Let me see - opening was perfect but suddenly half of the movie is boring, cheaply dark, second part of the movie is too chaotic. Movie trashes other truly legendary films about their non logical sory but here is seemingly everything logical ? LOL ... I could name like 6 very stupid/ilogical/boring things but hey, whats the point. Im just glad all the avengers nonsense ended. I liked Infinity War for its adult-ish story, dark/serious tone, nice and attractive story but here producers knew that EVERYTHING goes and NOTHING will be criticised from die hard fans.. Even if the movie was bad in 50% of the avengers fan, still everybody from you would love it.. Producers have the luck that this franchise is very very solid in terms of acceptance..
For neutral fan like me ? theres HUGE gap between Infinity War and Endgame.10 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,The worst Marvel film,"I really liked all of previous Marvel films, but this one was a huuuge disappointment. More than half of the film was really boring, in fact nothing happened. Fight scenes looked like made by 10-year-old Marvel fan. All of the film seemed to be made out of fan theories and dad jokes. I'm sad because it's the end of this Marvel era and this wasn't the final I was expecting.26 out of 57 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Overhyped,"The first 30 minutes were almost all talk, so boring. They finally got to some action and humor but with too many characters to keep track of and an over the top storyline in ridiculousness, it was still just not that engaging, not to mention way too damn long. The first Avengers movie rocked. Every one since has been a disappointment unfortunately.

Avengers: Endgame,Pretty bad!!,"Went into this very excited, came out very disappointed. The worst avengers film, possibly the worst marvel film. It was incredibly boring the only reason I'm giving it a 3/10 is the battle scene that was the only entertaining part of the film. I don't get all the hype around this film. The visual effects are amazing (just like all marvel films). It tries to be emotional, but it's very predictable and it failed to do that for me. 3/10 very overrated.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,Garbage Time,"Easy shots by skilled players make this a fairly disappointing finale to arguably one of the most depressing set-ups in action film history.While not fully predictable, there certainly aren't any surprises. Plot points were easily filed under ""sure. Why not.""Heavy handed, almost disingenuous, with it's moral platitudes; the film couldn't muster any real investment in it's characters' developments. It had to rely on cheap TV drama level sentimentality. Requisite emasculation and patronizing feminism negated each other. It basically felt like the producers just don't know any, or even worse, like any actual humans.Oh. Pacing was tortuous. You're going to see it anyway, though. So have fun.Bonus points for ID-ing the purposeful use of satanic imagery at the end of the movie. Why. Just why.....?",1
Avengers: Endgame,"First Review, 2nd Underwhelming marvel movie","After the disappointing ""age of ultron"", infinity war was a breath of fresh air. Endgame,however, feels like a rush job, playing on the cliche time travel trope. The writers for endgame were better off letting Thanos keep the stones and having the avengers deal with their losses for the first half of the movie. I would of love to see thanos get to utilize the different stones and their abilities, instead of having the movie turn into ""battle for the snap"". The cliche girl power moment towards the end of the film was also cringe, you already did that in infinity war so it doesn't have that same impact this time around. Also the confusion, if there are 3 different tesseract's for the sake of plot, does that mean there are three different thanos? does the snap only defeat that timelines thanos or does he still exist in other timelines? The movie had it's moments, but i didn't leave feeling excited about it like infinity war, and once again the black order is useless, but whatever i'll still show up for avengers 5.3 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,Will be an unpopular opinion with all fans,"There are two types of Marvel fans: Those that are true to the cinematic universe, and those that grew up embracing the comic book universe. You'll know who's who by hearing their opinion, or reading their review. To mine, I believe there were far too many opportunities missed where this movie could've leapt to incredible heights.Unfortunately, the universe and popular comic book story lines were sacrificed to cater for politically correct propaganda. Definitely a missed opportunity, and a sour end to a great run of films (excluding Captain Marvel).1 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Movie,Title,Review,isPos
Avengers: Endgame,"A horribly, boring and goofy installment. Worst one yet.","This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense, comedy, and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society. Based on today's man-hating culture, testosterone is evil. Women should be lumberjacks and Seal Team Six. Men should take estrogen pills and ask their wives to open the stuck peanut butter lid. I'm a proud sexist. I open doors for ladies. I also send my lady flowers just because versus craftsman tools.This was one of the worst Avengers installments ever. Writers are so busy pushing their masculine-man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) water downed buffoons. They failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. If the Hulk and Thor are not smashing something or someone that is extremely powerful, Marvel isn't worth watching IMHO. They are the ultimate warriors. Yet in this installment, they are childish buffoons. The nadless, testosterone-hating writers of today have devolved the franchise into an Everybody Loves Raymond-esque sitcom. However, Everybody Loves Raymond is better written.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Cognitive dissonance,Are those people who rated this higher than a four suffering from cognitive dissonance? It seems you all allowed the hype to inect your thinking and judgement. This is in my opinion the worse film in the Marvel universe series followed by civil war. To many characters a (story) so so lazy that wasonly written to try and tie the strands of the universe together. The film is at least 1 whole hour to long and is frankly boring. Disney are in danger of destroying this franchise like they have ruined the star wars saga. Why have they ruined the hulk who is now a cuddly bubbling idiot with everything that made him one of the most loved characters stripped from him. Even the set pieces are so so nothing different nothing original. People on here need to start telling the truth because a rating averaging 8.6 is simply a lie. Go watch it and review it without society's cognitive dissonance about this film running through your brains. 4/10 the worse in the series.19 out of 27 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thought i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong.

I real waste of my money and time. Things all started going downhill after Infinity War..Thor is a one big giant joke,hes not godly,epic,interesting or manly anymore hes just a big man child. Hulk was always a bit more comical which is fine but now its on this whole new level of stupidity. Ironman is the only one with any character left and yet even Robert Downey Jr has to suffer when pitted against such terrible writing. Things just happen that dont make sense, characters suddenly become moronic and the entire build up of epic moments is taken down into this ultra cringe scene that ruins the whole plot.The constant misplaced child humor and the attempts to make ever little scene into a Disney baby movie is sickening. Things can't be taken seriously anymore or its too offensive,everything needs to be dumbed down into this childish mush so the general public can clap their hands and drool. I'm really glad this series is over with before they burn it into the ground more..Yet i cant help but think about all the other comics that will be ruined with this writing style..Are IQs really so low now that this is what counts as a ""good"" movie?!",1
Avengers: Endgame,"slighty awkward or boring at times, slow dialog, some cool stuff","Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story.",1

Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook.
Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance.

Avengers: Endgame,"Predictable, boring and sometimes, cringeworthy","Endgame is such a bad conclusion for the epic Avengers saga. Everything sounds predictable and even boring, as the firsr 2 hours of movie is a non-sense fanservice for HQ readers. All the hype the movie had relied only on Marvel franchise, because the movie, at best, is mediocre, even compared to the previous one. There are a few cringeworthy momments to take note: ""professor"" Hulk 4th wallish jokes, the time travel machine itself, fat drunk Thunder God Thor and the worst one: ""She's not alone"" empowered heroines against the purple male patriarch. Unless you are a fanboy or fangirl, watching this will be 3 hours less in your lifespam.38 out of 61 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Spider-Man 2 is my personal favourite, but please stop giving these movies a 10/10. Endgame is a 7 at best. It's probably the most flawed Avengers film story wise.

Avengers: Endgame,Disapointing,"I'm not a hardcore ""Avengers"" fan. But being a movie fan means I am of course caught up in the buzz around this. Unfortunately I feel this is purely aimed at the mega fans, and I can imagine even some of them being disappointed.It all starts out promising. Setting things up and being as good humoured as usual. But then the time travelling stuff sets in. At first it sounded like this was going to be fun. But as it marched on it felt like way to much was being thrown in there, and the entire story (and a few of the previous movies) seem to get trashed in the chaos. I love time travel movie's if they setup some rules and stick to them. But do alot of contradicting stuff and you lose me.Still. There are a few surprises, and the big finale is still amazing to look at. The Ending does seem fitting, but the stink from the middle part of the movie stays throughout, and i was left scrathcing my head at least a couple of times more with revelations at the end.Oh, and I'm not sure what I think about the hulk in this. He seemed like he was just there for laughs. Unintentional or otherwise.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Could have been a lot better,"So a handful of heroes fight all the way to the climactic end of the movie, and then they lose the chance to finish what they started. I am not going to spoil it, but watching a million CGI characters appear on both sides was like letting all the air out of the tires. All the dramatic build-up was lost when it became a billions against billions battle.Which brings up the fact that at least 90 minutes of this movie is spent on boring scenes of various Avengers feeling depressed about the death of the heroes, and going to support group meetings. We get it. The Avengers are depressed. This could have been covered in fifteen minutes or less in a group meeting. We did not need to follow each Avenger through their depressing trip down memory lane. Thank God Ant Man came back from the quantum universe and got the ball rolling!!Unfortunately, Thor becomes the punchline for jokes throughout the movie. Since Captain Marvel is the new #1 hero, they had to power down Thor by turning him into a drunken hobo. The Incredible Hulk has spent the past three movies (Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War, & this one) in permanent erectile dysfunction, and he continues to be a zero in this movie. Thor and the Hulk are just here to be the focus of comedy as has-beens. Even Bruce Banner as a scientist gets slapped down. Michael Douglas and the Pym Particles have to fix what Bruce Banner fails to do. It is a very sad way for two of Marvel's earliest and most powerful heroes to end their game.There are a lot of good moments in Endgame. Most of them happen when the small crew of Avengers is trying to find the original gems. Then the battle when it is just the small group against Thanos is excellent. It was building up to a great ending, Captain America & Iron Man defeating Thanos, against all odds. Even Thor was redeeming himself in the battle! That is how this Marvel Comics masterpiece could have ended. But they had to throw in the billions of CGI characters and turn it into a big circus act... Too bad. Less was more.",1

Now With Last Reminding Survivors Superheroes That includes iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, War Machine And Thor Are Left Wandering Of What To Do Until Scott Lang Ant Man Who Had Comes Out Of The Quantum Relem And Sees All Of Everyone Are Gone As He Tells The Last Reminding Superheroes That There is a Way To Bring Back All Of The Other Fallen Heros Who All Turned To Dust To Life By Undoing The Snap And Going Back in Time To Collect All Six infinity Stones Before Thanos Gets All Of Them And Try To Undo The Snap And Destroying Thanos For Good This Time And The Result is Yes, Thanks To iron Man Who Scarifices His Life As He Has All Infinity Stones And Undo The Snap But This Time He Mange To Destroy Thanos As He Himself Who Turn To Dust And Ashes And By Saving All Of The Comeback Superheroes. The Verdict is, Robert Downey Jr. in His Last Role As Tony Stark/Iron Man Who Gives One Of His Finest Performance Of a Lifetime, Along With Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd Don Cheadle Karen Gillan And Scarlett Johansson All Deliver First Rate Performances As Well As Black Widow, Captain America, War Machine, Hulk, Thor, Ant Man Nebula And Hawkeye Also Too it Was Great And Cool To See All Of The Other Cast Members Comeback As There Believeable And Iconic Characters in Which includes Bendict Cumberbatch As Doctor Strange, Sebastian Stan As The Winter Soldier, Chadwick Boseman As Black Panther, Elizabeth Olsen As Scarlet Witch, Anthony Mackie As The Falcon, Evangelion Lilly As The Wasp, Dave Bautista As Drax, Chris Pratt As Star Lord, Letitia Wright As Shuri, Danai Gurira As Okoye, Pom Klemetieff As Mantis, Vin Disell As Voice Groot, Zoe Saldana As Gamora, Tom Holland As Spider-Man, Gwyneth Paltrow As Pepper Potts, Brie Larson As Captain Marvel, Benedict Wong As Wong And Tessa Thompson As Valkyrie As They Come And Help Out To Fight And Destroy The Villainess Thanos For One And For All Played By Of Course Josh Brolin. Another Thing Of What i Like About This Final Chapter Of An Avengers Film Are Flashback Scene Sequences Of Seeing All Of The Pervious Cast Who Started in These Marvel Movies Are Robert Redford As The Villian Alexander Pierce And Frank Grillo As Brock Rumlow Both From""Captain America"": The Winter Soldier"", Nalalie Portman As Jane Foster And Rene Russo As Frigga Thor's Mother From The First ""Thor"" Film And it's Sequel, Tom Huddleston As Loki From The First Avengers Movie"", Tilda Swinton As ""The Ancient One From ""Doctor Strange"" John Slattery As Howard Stark Tony Stark's Father From ""Iron Man 2"", And Hayley Atwell As Steve Roger's Girlfriend Margaret Carter. Anyways Avengers Endgame is Truly One Of The Best And Perhaps The Greatest Final Avengers Film Of All Time With Action-Packed Moment Scenes, it's a Little Bit Of Emotional At Times Epespecially Since The Scene That involves Black Widow Who Scarifices Herself To Retrieve The Soul Stone And Avengers Endgame Has Great Humor Moments As Well. P.S. This Final Avengers Film Goes Out To The Great Late Stan Lee And For All Of His Cameo Appreances in Every Marvel Superhero Movie That He Started in.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Everything but the kitchen sink,"If you have such wealth of acting at your disposal but reduce most of your cast to cameo appearances the story suffers. Some of the cameos were great to watch, they are the world's best known actors after all, but to me it was just a bit too much of everything and I lost interest when I lost count of all the characters, plots and subplots. I think I like it better when they focus on one or a few superheroes. High points of the movie: any scene with Tony Stark or Thor, but why use a star like Nathalie Portman when all she has to do is look pretty and walk around a bit, it makes you wonder whether these stars are short on money though. My grandson loved it though.16 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,Made for nerds.,"Personally as person who isn't too much into all this comic book stuff, I watched this and it wasn't even mediocre. This was a terrible movie. The drama, characters and action all where really bad. There were still some good scenes in the movie, however over the 3 hour long movie, most of it was terrible. A lot of the acting felt forced, especially with the female superhero actors. There was not a good presentation or an interesting and surprising ending. Not to mention the terrible comedy spread throughout the film. Constantly repeating jokes that were not funny, and lots of references that were rather unfunny and forced.This felt like a nerdy fan film sequel to the really good movie, infinity war.13 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Fan service the movie!,"On first viewing you love how everything is tied up. Stop there! If you've only seen this movie once do yourself a favor and don't ever watch it again. On second viewing this is a below average overly long film in which very little happens in a bloated second act. The only thing that still stands up is the Avengers trinity of Thor, Captain America and Iron Man versus Thanos, but it real makes you question the power levels of these characters, Thanos took them all out with no stones. The time travel subplot has more holes than swiss cheese I don't care how much screen time they gave explaining it and ""joking"" about it, I quote joking because in the MCU references count as jokes. There's the soul stone, in the last movie you had to make a sacrifice, how is Black Widow's suicide a Hawkeye sacrifice? How does Thanos not feel all 5 stones leaving his glove? Why so much build up about the glove in the previous movies if Iron Man can make one in a few hours, there's more, there's so much more but, at the end of the day Disney's 3-hour infomercial manage to make billions of dollars while not anger China or SJWs in the porcess, so for that alone this was impressive.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Just Okay,"After all the hype and build up for this I was expecting a little more than a romantic end to the MCU's most beloved franchise.

In the people that loved it or disliked it that I've talked to I feel like a 50/50 split is what I'm hearing although after enjoying the previous marvel films. I do not know if the people who rated it so high just feel an obligation to themselves to say they loved it so in their heart they weren't let down or that they did truly enjoy this giant mess of a movie.

Endgame takes too long to get going, and then seemingly never ends.

Avengers: Endgame,all action and no content,"I'm a picky person and when you attempt to cram everything from the comic in to am movie it becomes logical as to why they changed so much.I don't like change unless it improves something. It is inefficient to change things and not have them improve the outcome.I thought some of the action scenes were good and yes, I shed a tear when so-and-so died, but meh, too many people, too many deus ex machina and sloppy writing makes everything else seem tarnished.And they could have done with less.I originally gave 3 stars but I bumped it to 4 for making me feel sad when I said I wouldn't.",1
Avengers: Endgame,One of the Worst 8.5+ Reviewed movies on IMDB,"First of all - this movie had to be brilliant to back up all the hype and legacy from earlier films. So is it brilliant? No, it's not even close.Second of all - Endgame just isn't a very good movie in any noteworthy sense, outside of effects and really good action scenes. And this brings me back to my first point. Perhaps this formula would work during the rise of comic films, but I can't see this film as anything but a huge disappointment.After a brutally emotional opening scene, that I have to admit - is really good, Endgame then proceeds to jump from scene to scene with inconsistent tone, pace, and development. A serious movie can have great humor, but the way Endgame uses slapstick humor, and non-serious characters is, well - silly. Is this a serious movie or not? Many of the films rules or conventions are openly broken to serve secondary storylines, and much of the 'science' is just plain dumb. I can suspend disbelief and get into stylized movies, but so much of this movie just comes off shallow and not really well thought out.This includes the story arc that to me has little natural flow. Many comic movies today seem to come off more as bad, incomplete TV episodes that rely on being part of a series for relevance. Movies should never be like that, and Endgame felt to me like three TV episodes jammed together, with three to five tac-on false endings.While I really liked many of the action scenes, which are clearly well conceived and beautiful to watch - at this point action scenes should be a given, and the story should have the same excellence. I don't feel like I'm being to picky when great movies in the Marvel universe exist (Dr. Strange for instance). I don't consider Infinity War one of them, but it's a heck of a lot better than Endgame.To me, outside of the opening scene, all the emotional moments fall absolutely flat. Considering the conclusion of Infinity War - there is a blatantly obvious sequence that should exude the epitome of joy. This part of the movie is hard to explain without giving spoilers, but in my opinion - this sequence is the writers biggest failure of the movie. The reunions are not well executed.Objectively, this movie probably deserves a 6 for production values, great action, and resolving the Infinity War outcome. But subjectively? I really thought this movie kinda sucked.",1

It wasn't necessary for it to be divided into two parts, hell it wasn't necessary for Endgame to be almost 3 hours long considering the flimsy plot!After I saw infinity wars, I already had a suspicion I was cheated, and Endgame proved that I was right. This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it!You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Probably the worst MCU film yet,"The movie lacked anything substantial. Infinity war was an epic yet end game tried to cram 21 movies into one. Plot holes everywhere with very little tying the movie together. It was almost too obvious with the direction of the plot. Infinity war had several stories which tied into one, yet endgame tried to do the same but got lost in too much meaningless jokes. Im really sorry for marvel studios but this was by far the worst movie in the marvel universe. Yes the fight scenes were good but the overall delivery was clunky and missing direction. I left the cinema super disappointed as the expectation was hyped up but the delivery was way below that expectation. I watched infinity war 3 times in the cinema, but i wished i waited for DVD for endgame, massive waste of money. Pretty much 2.5 hours of boring jokes and 30 mins of actual viewing pleasure.

Avengers: Endgame,"Great super hero movie, not so great overall movie","Endgame did a lot of great things including breaking the ""formula"" a lot of super hero movies seem to follow nowadays. This being said, it contained some awful story telling and character development.The Russo brothers merely wrote out how they want the movie to end, and made a connection to the present MCU. The movie is completely plot with very little / poor relationships and character development. The gates opened in many times to have a great breaking of relationships and massive character development, but the Russo's instead took those opportunities to make action sequences rather than anything that the audience would feel for more than 3 minutes afterward, a mere portion of an over three hour movie.Also, another point to note, there is a portion of a scene which scream ""women's equality"" at the viewer in the most cheesiest and cliche way which completely breaks whatever connection the viewer is currently having with the rest of the scene. The proper way to handle equality of women in movies is to just make them cool, and not overdo it to the extreme this movie demonstrated.If your a fan of the MCU, definitely watch it. Otherwise I would recommend to avoid it.",1

Its a boring movie, full of plot holes, only 20min of fight scenes in total and drama. LOTS and LOTS of drama, moaning and crying again and again.So, to sum it up:
* Plot holes not even the biggest fans can ignore.
* Inconsistencies between the movies.
* Way too many characters, just to appear on the movie, doing basically nothing.
* Huge changes to main characters, making them also useless.
* Almost no fight scenes! Set the alarm clock after 120min in the movie.
* Drama, crying, moaning, REPEAT.You have been warned, but it doesn't matter because you will ignore all the negative reviews and still go and see the movie. That's what i did, the same mistake.

I was waiting for this one for months now, so excited at what was going to come. But Alas.. What a mess.
The first hour is a complete boring time of them showing what the world has come to. I mean quite boring with slight humor.
Second hour, the movie starts picking up, with more content (confusing time travel) and some good humor.
The last hour (like when you are actually asking where's the action, where are the effects, 3D etc), it's starts to show some hope. And some action starts. Gets you going.. For a bit.. And then it ends.
The action is hardly there.. Whatever is there is forgettable. Nothing worth like the earlier ones.
Overall the movie is not a little below average, with nothing memorable in it. I can't believe the business is done.
I came home and had to watch Infinity War to get over this one. And believe me folks... Infinity War was way better than this. Way way better with its story and action.

Avengers: Endgame,Disappointment,"I won't spoil the movie....Endgame is terribly paced with actions that exist only to further the plot. Most character development is told to the audience instead of experienced. The movie breaks its own stated rules and character scaling makes no sense.If you turn off your brain and stop asking questions of what is transpiring on screen, then yes you will enjoy the movie.But if you ask even one question, you will become terribly frustrated and taken out of the movie. A film, no matter how fanciful, should suspend disbelief speaking to either real world logic or the logic it establishes in its own narrative. There is none of that, characters survive and perform actions only for spectacle and because it serves the whims of the writer not the story.Fans frankly deserve better.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Meh,"If you're a fan of the MCU, this movie most likely maxes out at about an 8/10. If you're a fan of superhero movies, this movie is not for you. Slow drama scenes fill the better part of a very long run time, leading to a 3 hour long superhero movie with only a handful of fight scenes and minimal action.Rather predictable for the most part. Very hit-or-miss: either a dream come true or quite mediocre. For the ""movie of the century"", it sure was a let down, that's for sure.36 out of 67 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Avengers: Endgame,Mediocre as best..,"It was very slow at many parts of the movie, many of them unnecessary and there were many things that was left unexplained. I felt they the movie was directed to the new marvel fans and didn't give us marvel veterans the fan service we wanted. It was a rather good comedy, but the action that I was expecting was lacking. The was put out to be appealing towards society and media, and not to us fans of the series.I feel betrayed, but understand why it ended up like this. I get why people would enjoy it, but I didn't.

Avengers: Endgame,Repetitive and Bland,"Blockbuster movies are made to entertain people and we mustn't expect logic, I fully agree with that. I had great fun watching MI: Fallout and Alita Battle Angel this year but Endgame turns out to be like every other superhero movie that came out this decade. The opening scene features Jeremy Renner losing his family after Thanos' actions in the last film, after that scene to till the end the movie just bombards us with video game like action sequences and unfunny jokes.The plot of the movie is much better most superhero films to its credit but the dialogue and screenplay was no different. While I don't want to spoil the plot, this film has bought back all characters associated with the MCU and is a reunion delight for many hardcore fans. The final battle sequence is my least favorite part of the film, it features random action sequences and right from the very start you would know how its gonna end. If you are expecting it to be like the ones you saw in The Lord of The Rings or Harry potter you are gonna end up disappointed.If this is Robert Downey Jr.'s last film as Iron Man as per reports its a great news for all movie buffs, a talented actor like him has wasted his last 5 years acting only in MCU franchise movies which didn't fully utilize his potential. Finally, this movie is going to be the biggest blockbuster of the year without any doubt but its only the beginning of end of the superhero genre.",1

Avengers: Endgame,Convoluted Mess,"A movie I feel like I've been waiting an eternity only for it to be a mild disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Marvel comics and have followed the movies with anticipation without any real misses. This was suppose to be the ultimate climax and while there were some nice twists it was in danger of unraveling, but they did just manage to hold it together.

Avengers: Endgame,Disappointing ending,"I really wanted this to be the best ending ever but I was so disappointed. The other Avenger movies were very enjoyable but this one was different. Like Dr Strange said there are so many ways this could have ended. Unfortunately, in order to close the many arcs the story just felt forced, poorly paced with many many liberties taken that should not have been like the ""storm trooper wielding a light saber moment"" with Captain America. They also manage to get every woman in the film in the frame at the same time looking real tough. Do we really expect that 3.5 seconds of supposed girl power to inspire anyone? Give me a break! It's very condescending IMO. Also I felt like other characters were not properly utilized. Technically the film looked really good and the acting was great. I'll watch it at home once and probably never again. It will still make tons of cash and a lot of people seem to be satisfied.39 out of 77 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Avengers: Endgame,Too much hype for a movie that lacked of character,"We already knew the story, the avengers trying to un-do what Thanos did in infinity war, for me this movie lacked of personality, I would have loved to see more relationship between characters, i liked the changes they did with some of them (Hulk), but there were characters that had insignificant appearances also.
The pace was not that bad for the runtime, but in the middle of the film I was hoping to see more challenges for the characters, and more drama, it looked like the movie lacked of effort. For the budget they had, they should've done a very great movie. This one didn't surprised me, infinity war was way much better.

Avengers: Endgame,Unpopular opinion,"I just love how the people hate it when the Youtube rewind comes out, and swallow the same agenda in a Marvel outfit. The whole plot is non existent, spiked with some fanboy pleasing absurdity and the compulsory fake sciense which doesn't make sense at all. The main contradiction is in the overall mood of the movie. In one second they emphasize how terrible everything is, then next minute they come up with at best a nose exhaling joke. The only good thing was that Captain Marvel barely appears on screen.

Avengers: Endgame,Anticlimax and flop,"All those who give good rating for this movie are school children and paid reviewers. The whole story are insensible, predictable and too shallow.

And then came a red girl (wanda) who almost kill thanos easily. To make it worst, how could cap. Marvel make it too difficult to hold thanos' fingers with both her hands? This doesnt make sense. Some other incident also plague the movie, such as, there would be two zamora after hulk use the stones; where is captain marvel in the story? The writer seems to be unconfident and has no idea how to fit her in the story; dr. Strange come only to play with water; they want to end iron man career coz r.

Avengers: Endgame,Disappointment.....Disappointment.....Disappointment.....,"A a stand off movie this one would have been a average one time watch with usual super hero stuff. But actually to conclude a franchise of this magnum, this is definitely not the way to do it. Maybe it because the crew and the directors got too much on their plate to handle. Unlike the previous MCU movies this movie took on a near to impossible task of connecting the dots from all the 22 movies and then bring it to a conclusion, which unfortunately just didn't happen. I would say personally as a fan this was a great disappointment as none of my favorite characters got enough screen time which they deserve and also it was like a dump yard all those who went missing being dumped in one place and suddenly they do their thing and its all done. Come on man its Tony and the send off is totally not worth it. Thor, maybe in the beginning I find it funny but once the story progress it just didn't go with the kinda of personality as we know. Capt. Marvel don't even know why she is in the movie first place, it would've made no difference even without her. The solution to bring ppl back it just happened over night and it was not convincing at all, except it involved Tony. Same goes with Hulk, happened just like that. it was just too much mess and they didn't do enough to clean it up. Two parts is seriously inadequate, could've been a trilogy....",1
Avengers: Endgame,I am so sorry everyone.,"It was just.. wasn't for me I guess? Avengers: Endgame is an epic tale of a closing chapter in the Marvel universe, presented as a serious movie with Marvel puns, gags and CGI heavy battles. The film tries to reinforce the fact, that what happend in IW is serious and the 3 hour long screen time makes you wander: Is this good or bad? 1 hour or so is about bragging about what happend at the end of the Infinity War, superheroes whining about their existence like ""we shouuuuuuuld doooo somethiiiiing"" but nothing happens for most of the part. I tried to like it, really but as a comic book movie, it was just pure fan service and good CGI with a lot of pointless scenes where everything is too explained. What I would like to point out that, IW was much better. It was a comic book movie, tried to be what it is and at the end it turned out to be much more. This, feels like the opposite. This film wants to be the ""much more"" part and at the end, it remembers that it is a comic book movie. There was a grand battle at this movie which reminded me to Anchorman where everyone from everywhere comes to battle along the heroes. It was so.... not serious at all? I don't know...If you are a Marvel fan, go out and watch it. You will have fun 100%. Anyone else, just try to like it, like I did...",1

Avengers: Endgame,Trivial. Silly. Predictable.,"Three words to describe the methodology inherent in destroying a franchise - or any story for that matter. For all the intrigue, conjecture, speculation, and cosmic potential Endgame enjoyed long before its release - and might have included - they opted for the least fascinating and pedestrian of stories: when it all else fails, just go back in time and change it! I do not mind heavy CGI movies with no substance; they're entertaining from a technical perspective, and when a decent story props it up, at least there exists some satisfaction. That said, with Infinity War, there was great possibility. I'm not going to bother with a detailed review here ... this movie was wrong ... all those richly detailed characters, all those amazing back stories, all that simmering creativity, all that ingenuity and inspiration totally and utterly wasted. I gave it 4 Stars just because it's nice to end the misery, but it is difficult to appreciation the wastefulness.

13 Reasons Why,Makes drama out of a serious issue,"PLEASE don't watch this show. Please. While I agree that it is addressing really serious issues that NEED to be talked about more, this show doesn't do such delicate topics justice. It teaches that you can make the people who hurt you feel bad - that they deserve to be punished. It shows that if you kill yourself, everyone will memorialize you forever and feel awful that you were hurting so much. It teaches kids that suicide is a possible answer to your problems. This show encourages vengeance, anger, and revenge. Don't give this show any more of your time. The side stories may be interesting but studies have shown that suicide rates have increased directly relating to this show. It is doing so much harm and it's time for it to end. I promise you that Netflix cares more about the money they are making than the lives they are destroying.95 out of 137 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,"Offensive, Shallow, and Boring","Absolutely horrendous show. Not only does 13 Reasons Why fail in every aspect required to tell a compelling story, but it also happens to have one of the most offensive and ignorant representations of a serious issue ive ever seen. To get the obvious out of the way, this show is horribly written, with horrendous on-the-
-nose dialogue and cardboard characters. These afformentionrd ""characters"" have absolutely no depth beyond the mental illnesses they happen to have. The only character with some depth beyond that is Clay, but still, if you take away his relationship with Hannah, you have an absolute bore of a character, with absolutely no personality or charm. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because there is SOME Interesting camerawork, but it's in the vast minority of boring cinematography.Now, to get to the real insult of this show, we have to look at its portrayal of mental illness. This show treats suicide as a revenge tactic. That in itself is the absolute worst thing a show about SUICIDE AWARENESS can ever do. By portraying such a topic in this way, it tells impressionable audiences who may be struggling with these thoughts that suicide is a viable way to get revenge on people who wronged them. This is only further pushed by how much this ""plan"" actually works in the show itself. The tapes start an absolute riot and an uprising against who wronged Hannah. I have no doubt this will push impressionable and vulnerable audiences further to this decision. Beyond that, the rest of the mental illnesses in the show feel as if they only exist to fill out a checklist. Every character has to have a specific mental illness that defines them, simply so the show can say that it ""represents"" these topics, no matter how absolutely horrendously it portrays them.Overall, not only is this show comepletely inept in terms of quality and entertainment, but it remains a perfect example of how NOT to represent some of the most sensitive topics in modern society.Overall, don't watch it.",1
13 Reasons Why,I could find 13 reasons why this is a bad show,"I did not like 13 reasons why because I felt as if the show almost promted the idea of sucide, I think it kind of promotes the idea of sucide because when Hannah leaves those tapes it's like she was trying to get revenge on the people that wronged her which might give pepole the wrong idea of committing sucide.42 out of 59 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

13 Reasons Why,Romantic view on suicide,"This show Romanticizes revenge suicide. It is disgusting how they use teen suicide as entertainment. Everything the original '90s ""Heathers"" tried to condemn which is the idea that teenagers biggest decision in life is to decide whether or not they are going to kill them selves. THIS SHOW IS TRIGGERING FOR SUICIDAL OR RAPE VICTIMS. DO NOT WATCH IF YOU ARE SEVERELY DEPRESSED.

13 Reasons Why,Nothing unusual,"Over-offended teenagers that are bored and create drama over everything, pretending they are better than others. Pretty sums up all teenagers, refusing to take responsibility living in a society where simulating and being popular is more important than being true to yourself.

13 Reasons Why,A depressing tale of an unworthy story,"One of the most disgusting teen tv show featuring a adolescent cast creating a storyline to make you feel sorry, sad and depressed with major flaws in the so called REASONS and narrated so as to gain empathy with the victim. Most of the so called REASONS are not even justified and the show only creates a negative atmosphere and a bad mentality in the head of the viewers rather than tackling these problems in real life. Only moody teenagers with low self esteem and ADHD will bother to give this series a thumbs up. The perfect show to watch in this genre will be SEX EDUCATION which also explores the same issues but it doesn't end up making you feel sad or angry but rather gives a positive attitude towards those problems. If you haven't watched this show yet then kindly skip it and avoid the unnecessary pointless depressing pathetic ideas that it will leave in your head.12 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,Trash don't know how how it has an 8.2,"Season 1 wasn't bad but season 2 is just garbage. They claim to bring awareness of suicide so people will speak up before they try to commit it. All the show does though is explain to those that are suicidal that it's worthless to speak up, that no ones is going to help them that they might as well kill them selves because if they get raped or bullied nothing will truly happen to those who hurt them. If you are suicidal do not watch this might provoke you to commit suicide. Not to mention the show is terrible watch breaking bad instead the guy all though twisted represents someone with an extremely complex personality that develops every season and all though dying is trying to make the best of his last days even though not legally haha.10 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

13 Reasons Why,Do what you Want (I only watched Season 1),"13 reasons why is the story of a teenage girl who commits suicide and leaves tapes behind for several different people depicting why they are to blame for her death. I'll be honest I found this concept incredibly interesting when I watched season 1. While watching I found the filmwork incredible, the storylines intriguing, and overall I thought the show was amazingly well-done. About a year after I watched the first season of the show and a couple of weeks after the second season had been introduced to Netflix my opinion completely changed. One of my best friends commited suicide and it completely messed with everything I had thought. I miss her constantly and think about her all the time. This is why I find this show so insulting. If she had left behind tapes telling me I was at fault for her death it would probably destroy me. The fact that Hannah does not seek help for the problems that she is going through and blames other people for her death is despicable. She made a choice and this show completely disregards that that choice was her own and no one elses. Anyway I'm probably an isolated case, and like I said I did enjoy watching this series before, so I guess just be aware and If you are dealing with the suicide of a friend it is not your fault regardless of what this show conveys.",1

13 Reasons Why,An Honest Review,"So, what we have here is a game of blame. A blame game that pushes the responsibility for a suicide from the individual to everyone else, almost saying that the decision to off oneself is made by others.And then, as if to draw the biggest difference between Millennials and everyone else, it almost goes out of its way to say that people don't base their views on what everyone else thinks are wrong for being independently minded.The message is clear, let others think for you unto your death.9 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,teen angst drama masquerading as deep and provocative social commentary,"Clearly demonstrates the problem of writing a show with only a single, clever premise.

First World life is like totes so difficult, amirite?The reality is though the single premise is quite clever, the characters are hollow and stereotypical, the plot makes little to no sense, the acting is barely tolerable.

13 Reasons Why,Genuinely awful,"I'm not sure if a majority of the ratings of this horrendous TV show are fake, or if we as a society are such brain-dead sheep that we conform to whatever the media sells and tells us. This show has nothing good about it. Nothing. The only the potentially interesting aspect, the story, is absolutely butchered. It's not unique, it's just like every other lame American High School drama with heavy themes forced in to try and seem edgy and relevant, and the way it handles these themes is so incredibly insensitive and, for a lack of a better word, stupid. This is not how we should be talking about suicide. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, ever. Don't watch it. Not even out of curiosity.

This show tries to make a rapist look sympathetic. The characters in this show LITERALLY get away with murder. Multiple characters do various blatant illegal things but never face any consequences. Random characters appear and know EVERYTHING about everyone. Ghosts cone out the woodwork. This is Netflix's greatest embarrassment and should have been a 1 season show BUT in true fashion they chase the money and just turned this into some fantasy teen melodrama murder, rapist, mental health epic.

13 Reasons Why,Wrong message portrayed,"All I can say is that I spent the entire series extremely frustrated. In summary- You CAN find a way through emotionally & physically hard times & this series seems to glorify suicide.Firstly, as many others on here have pointed out- The main character Hannah is her own worst enemy. Every small situation she made into a big one. When life throws you lemons, make lemonade. Many, many people throughout her 'reasons' had reached out to her to help, yet she pushed each one away... but expected them to come running back anyway?! That is not how life works. Sometimes you have to face the consequences, suck it up & recifty the situation. All I could see was that teenagers in a difficult position would see how Hannah reacted in these circumstances & see her reactions as justified & OK? Yes, some of them were justified - Lots were not.I'm not saying that it didn't portray an important message because it did. I'm trying to put across that suicide is not the only option. There is help & you should try and grasp it with both hands whenever offered to you. Hannah should not have expected ANYONE to come running after her, she should've been responsible for her own actions & taken the help that was offered.I feel that 'over-reacting' is a good explanation as to how she dealt with situations. Yes, high school/secondary school is hard. If you are bullied then report it & seek help. There were a lot of situations that I watched & I was shouting at the computer as they could've been shrugged off or made into a light hearted situation. PLEASE if anyone is feeling similar, just remember that there is life after school & trust me, it improves massively.My overall point is that the message & most of the 'reasons' were awful reasons to justify & show why someone would commit suicide. I feel like it could've promoted how to deal with the issues better & how to open up to those who can help. Those who are bullying or even trying to JOKE with you- either REPORT it or LAUGH with them. Don't take life too seriously, love yourself, DO NOT expect things from others when you push them away & seek HELP when needed.",1
13 Reasons Why,Not going to give you 13 reasons,"At first my interest was awakened by this situation. I have read other coming of age books that handle the suicide subject and, well, it's a subject that has come across my own life very often as well. Especially during those teen-times. I am now older. Wiser? I don't know. But what I do know is that this show at first hit me, with a positive feeling. A human way of looking at issues that teens have to deal with. But then I started to realize with what I was dealing here. A show, based on a book which I haven't read but might probably rate the same way, that deals with a subject that's so delicate, it should have been thought of twice what this could actually do to people. The storytelling is OK, even though a bit slow, but the way other characters react. The way they deal with the tapes. the way the school deals with the aftermath and the students who may or may not have been traumatized. It gives off a totally wrong message. As if it is normal to act this shallow. Besides the fact that this show is totally not realistic in my eyes (I mean, it starts a week after the suicide and already so many people have had the tapes and listened to them and forwarded them even. And no one ever thought it would be wise to have someone else listen to them or think about consequences. Or no one ever questioned if Hannah was sane enough to know what she did.) the story also shows off as if a suicide victim, and I call them victims, always know so well what they do when they kill themselves. People, sad reality is that most of the suicides aren't happening with people who are clear enough to fully understand what they are doing. Let alone take the time to make tapes, prepare long time in advance, as if they can watch what happens afterwards. I gave 4 stars at first, but writing this review with tears in my eyes, made me realize how bad this show is. all I can say is, please if you watch it, realize, this is not normal. not real. It is horrible!",1
13 Reasons Why,insufferable,"I find the positive reception that this series received to be truly depressing. Society - at least in the United States of America - must be genuinely sick, that people could enjoy this drivel, and worse, that we are expected (or so I suppose) to empathize or sympathies with the egotistical and irrational main character, Hannah. Unhappily I found myself wishing she had killed herself without leaving the tapes, thus avoiding destroying the lives of so many people around her.I'm updating this review because I have now had the dubious pleasure of watching seasons 2 and 3 - I can't believe they have actually given a season 4 go-ahead. By the end of season 3 the message is clear - rape is bad, but you can get away with murder so long as the person you kill is a bad person. Absolutely incredible that anyone approved this for general release.",1

13 Reasons Why,triggering and over dramatic,"The show is honestly shocking. when i finishes reading thirteen reasons why (the book by jay asher), i felt a little sad, a little shaken up, but also positive. the book showed that hannah was dealing with issues that were made worse by the way she was treated, and that we should always try to help people in any way we can no matter what. the show completely ruined this and turned it into a revenge story.TRIGGER WARNINGS : rape, sexual assault, suicidein the book, hannah was not raped in the same way as seen in the show - she was fingered. of course this is awful and in no way good at all, but there was absolutely no reason for it to be turned into penetrative rape. as well as this, in the book she did not slit her wrists in a bathtub - she overdosed on pills. obviously the suicide scene should not have been shown at all, but showing her taking too many pills would have been at least a fraction easier to watch than her sitting in the bathtub slitting her wrists - you can actually see the razor blade cutting into the skin. netflix was clearly trying to make everything more dramatic. not only does this make the show more triggering, but it also invalidates things that are not so extreme that can still mentally harm people. these are not the only things season one exaggerates, although they are the only triggering examples of netflix trying to make everything more dramatic. as well as this, the scenes were just so, so triggering that i could barely watch them. netflix made a huge mistake with season to as well, as i have heard about the rape scene that takes place. however, i have decided not to watch season two because of how triggering the first season was. netflix really made a mistake here.",1

13 Reasons Why,Not socially responsible.,"As a parent who has a teenage daughter who has attempted suicide twice, I find this show horrible! My teenage daughter took 3 bottles of pills and was in the hospital for a month. Exactly, six months later she slit her wrist up and down and was away from home for five months getting treatment. Every where I went I was told by counselors, doctors, and psychiatrists, etc. that the number of teen suicides have increased significantly since this show aired. The people who created this show and the network that airs it must not have a conscious, otherwise they would not be able to live with themselves. Appalled mother.8 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,From a psychologist stand point.,This show maytar Hanna Baker is a selfish cognitive mess. That causes clay a lot of other children more issues with her dumb ass tapes. And what she did to her parents wow. This show is going to do more harm than good know this there is not two human brains that fire the exact same way.

13 Reasons Why,Banalizing RAPE (Rape is NORMAL) --- DISGUSTING,"I find this series abominable DISGUSTING
It talks about rapes, suicides, harassment of a NATURAL quite banal that I have the sheaf.
To believe that they are trying to rationalize rape, harassment and suicide by multiplying them in the show and talking about them like it is something totally normal.
It's really disgusting, BANALIZE rape, suicide and harassment please !!!
Does that only shock me ?!
Now they add a murder in HIGH SCHOOL YAYYY !!! (yes because let's not forget that they are teenagers) let us trivialize the murder also while we are there is not it? It's a big Joke.
Thoughtless as a series.

13 Reasons Why,"6 times too long, 6 times too weak","I read the Wiki page first and though that surely these critics with negative reviews must have been just pesky, petty and picky. Well just 3 episodes latter I had to agree with them.Producers wanted to crank out way too many hours and just that was enough to ruin otherwise good conceptual idea. I thought that maybe it's the case of the ""being faithful to the book"" delusion (books are written for different audience and blindly following that is preven recipe for disaster), but no - the book has just 320 pages. You just can't make 13, 26, now 39 ? hours from that - there's no material.Fist going for 60 instead of 45 min episodes immediately stretches out everything and it's painfully visible. Filler, after filler, after filler. And then 13 episodes per season where you barely have enough for 10 and an insult to injury going for 3 seasons where the material is barely enough for one.That's the core reason why people perceive the main character as unbelievable, artificial, even stupid. 6 times more minutes than material.Then the forced ""social services"" cross ""instructional"" attempt which just serves to annoy with stupidity and cements the show as a fabrication that doesn't support its own lead character. It's like they wanted to ""make something for every (political) segment"" and the result is of course one big nothing. It would be semi justifiable if this was an ABC show (the Nielsen terror, always having to dumb down to pander to the lowest 30% segment). But not for a cable and even more for a web streaming show.To make any sense at all a ""suicider story"" show has to take totally opposite direction. To vigorously defend it's lead character's right to suicide and a legitimate choice in the given situation - whatever it is. Only then it becomes genuinely controversial and exploding with primal attraction for the audience to see the forbidden fruit.Even if half of the audience ends up hating the lead, the center holds strong and gives birth to a mythical character. Remember Hedda Gabler? Imagine if Ibsen watered her down to ""get twice the text"" or ""be the advocate for 'social worker acceptable' line"". Imagine ""politically correct"" Dexter?Otherwise don't take on the subject you don't have the guts and brains to carry. It's not for everyone.Casting was largely sub par, possibly due to a very low budget. The character named Clay doesn't actually have to look and feel like clay :-) He's supposed to portray very smart but socially awkward guy - not a clad dummy with zero facial expressivity. Camera, camera. camera - need actors that camera likes and reads - camera is the audience. Lead actress, occasionally a glimpse but it's more the camera, directors and editing breaking their backs.Interesting thing though, two young black actresses came from the background and stole every single scene they had - Alisha Boe and Ajiona Alexus. Probably because no one was paying attention to tell them to stop since the ""star"" is vanishing :-)) If the show wasn't with cemented ""progression"", even semi competent writing teams start writing for such actors on their own - just because it's fun and rewarding to make things for for someone who can do more.",1
13 Reasons Why,Excitement Saturation,"We are getting close to entertainment saturation. In the early years of motion picture, it took a train merely moving toward the camera to excite the audience, where murder, rape, torture, sex (Porn in some cases) barely excite the audience in this day and age. The studios need to excite the audience to perform at the box office and they are running out of ideas.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,Dangerous Deception,"I work in a high school. The biggest problem I see with this show is that it takes the most extreme and difficult situations and presents them as ""everyday"". Portraying suicide as a revenge and escape is both dangerous and false. Netflix is very irresponsible in the way they handled this. Every expert that they consulted advised against many of the details in the show. Anything for a buck--even if it results in more deaths. Don't try telling me that the show will spark good conversation about teen suicide. For those struggling with mental health and especially depression, shows like this promote negativity and self doubt. There should be an option on Netflix to block content. The show has already been banned in some places.11 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,"So she had problems, I can understand that...","So she had problems. What a revelation. She was a depressed paranoid schizophrenic maniac from day one. She would have committed suicide any way. So sorry that it took her so long to make up her mind. 13 episodes of 13 Reasons Why could have been done in just one episode.So sad that this TV series is loved by youngsters that simple see all this as something that will never happen to them. The truth being that very few girls ever live such an experience, and even fewer commit suicide, and even fewer make tapes to mess up the lives of their friends.So incredibly unfortunate that people will sit down and watch this garbage instead of moving on and making something of their life.19 out of 39 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,Unrealistic and Cringeworthy,"This show feels like it was either written/directed by adults who don't remember anything about high school and are completely out of touch with today's youth, or by bratty high school students who are overdramatizing their social lives to unwitting adults. Either way, it's plot is full of gaping holes. Clay, like any other normal human being, would have blown through the tapes in one session, but if he had, there would be no show. (Almost) all the acting is cringeworthy. The characters are constantly doing things real people never actually do (which can sometimes make for an exceptional story, but not when the show clearly strives to be realistic). This show is garbage. Don't believe the hype that it is ""deep"" or ""eye-opening."" It's weak and it's a waste of your time.16 out of 32 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,Worst TV Show Ever. Shouldn't Be Available to Teens,"Talking about suicide in a way that honors it is horrible. Blaming people for suicide is also terrible. All people, specifically teens and high school students need to understand that you make your own reality, other people don't. Whether your life is super challenging or super great, there is always a reason to live - I know this from the super challenging end. This should not be available to people of all ages who could be struggling and wondering if they should take their life. This TV show promotes suicide. BAD. Please take this off!!23 out of 50 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,I used to love this until Season 2.,There is such a horrible scene to watch in Season 2 Ep 13 that it made me feel physically sick. One of the characters is beaten up and then sodomised with a broomstick. It felt gratuitous and was horrible to watch.

13 Reasons Why,It's Only 'Moving' if You've Never Experienced It,"As someone who first contemplated suicide in the fifth grade and continues to deal with suicidal ideation I can tell you it's quite easy to blame other people. Sometimes the blame is justified, but not all of it and even then there's always more to it than the actions of others. Sometimes kids are bullied to the point where they can't take it anymore and they break mentally with no one to turn to. This isn't the case of our main, narcissistic character, Hannah. So, when I say that Hannah was selfish and that others weren't responsible for her decision I'm not belittling those who actually were tormented into mental turmoil. What this girl went through doesn't even compare to what most who commit suicide have dealt with in their lives. That isn't to say her pain didn't matter, but what does matter is that she left behind a series of tapes laying the blame on a ton of people who weren't at fault. The majority of suicides don't happen with notes left behind because they're the result of unbelievable anguish and not some perfectly articulated scheme to hurt people. If this show wants to deal with this girl's tapes blaming others for her death they shouldn't focus on how she was right to do so, but rather point out just how wrong that is. While we want to help those with mental illness we should also help those around them understand that they are not responsible for the happiness of others. They can't always know what's wrong with someone and they aren't at fault for their unhappiness. That's not how mental illness works. There are so many nuances that this show could have touched upon, but it instead focuses on melodrama and ultimately it's main goal - pure revenge porn. These tapes don't serve a purpose for helping others who may feel suicidal or for showing others the error of their ways. They exist only to make a bunch of people feel bad, and these are people who for the most part are completely innocent in regards to Hannah. If this girl is suffering from any mental disorders they seem to be narcissism and sociopathy as she just wants to hurt people and needs to use that as a justification for what she did. Attempting to cater this show to others who may be seeking help - especially teenagers - is completely irresponsible, and I'm glad I'm not the only one intelligent enough to comprehend this. This show is awful.",1
13 Reasons Why,Ruined everything,"All the normal criticism aside, this show has messed me up psychologically and has effectively messed up two friendships, big time. Would not recommend.

13 Reasons Why,My daughter is in the Pediatric Intensive Care unit,"My 15 year old daughter attempted suicide 2 nights ago. She is currently in the Pediatric Intensive Care unit. Your show dramatizes suicide in a way that glorifies and romanticizes it for impressionable young audiences. Remember that every award or accolade that you earn is at the expense of yet another child that commits suicide or attempts it. At the expense of a family destroyed to the core of their being. The quality of your work is not in question. The people involved in making this, producing this and the young actors portraying these characters will someday struggle immensely with the knowledge of the deaths they contributed too. Life imitates art. You should not be making a season two. You have a social responsibility to stop.

13 Reasons Why,Should have stopped after season 1,"I thought season 1 was good, seemed like it was trying to bring some awareness of mental health issues to light. But that seems to now be the complete opposite. Now its turned into some tv drama that just wants to shock people with nasty graphic scenes that I wish I could erase from my mind. I know they have a warning at the start but seriously I was not expecting a certain scene in the last episode of season 2 that I really wish I could unwatch. It definitely didn't do any favours for my mental health. In fact I felt physically sick for days, I couldn't sleep or eat for 3 days, I suffer from anxiety and low mood so you could say I have a sensitive mind to certain topics. But I'd say If you suffer from a mental health issue then I really recommend not watching this tv show, it will not help and more than likely make it worst. I haven't watched anymore after season 2, god knows how much further they will go with it.3 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

13 Reasons Why,Angsty teen drama with dull story,"This show is a regular person's idea of what a suicide looks like based on some attention seeking teens crying about boyfriend issues. It trivializes the struggle of teens who really do feel suicidal. I am sickened by the author of the book and the producers of this show. This is exploitative voyeurism. Nothing more.No one who suicides would go to such lengths to make and distribute those tape; and no one who would go to such lengths to make and distribute those tapes would suicide. 13 hours of dull bullshit about ""this girl kissed a guy I like"" or ""Oh! I'm so mysterious I will speak for hours and say nothing of importance"". That is not a suicide note. That is typical attention seeking behavior. When you are sure you are going to kill yourself, the last thing you would care about is what some random classmate thinks about you or anything else. Real suicide notes are short, to the point, and sometimes even humorous. Apologize to the people you love, some practical instructions about what to do after you die, and possibly a few witty sentences to get off your chest. That's that.If you are one of these people who watched the show, then read this review and strongly disagree with me. Don't waste your time down voting this. Think about it, what the world really need is help lines for attention seekers who are not suicidal but do genuinely need someone to talk to nonetheless. Then the suicide help lines can be left to those who need it.",1
13 Reasons Why,One of the worst I've seen,This film is everything wrong with our young today. As for the title I'd say I can easily pick 13 reasons why not to watch it.

Kids this age are barely 5.1 ft and have just started washing dishes yet all this lot are the way they are in the series. It's crazy.I mean I thought realism stopped when we were given Orange County or Riverdale but this is worse and that's being totally honest. For sure there's decent actors in.

We kept waiting for it to turn into the amazing show everyone was talking about but mid-way through episode 4 we gave up.The dialogue was inauthentic and weird; the acting was sub-par; and the directing was off. For example, one of the characters slaps a piece of paper down on the table in front of another character and then a beat later dramatically stands up and... just stands there. It was laughably bad.We read the synopses of the other episodes and the entire thing was completely contrived. If the point was some sort of PSA, they missed the mark on that, too, as nowhere during the regular episodes is there any mention of a suicide hot-line or how one could get help fighting bullying; in fact, the message delivered was adults won't help you so don't even bother trying.So bad and for the life of me I can't understand how it's getting such rave reviews. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",1

They're stupid they're clueless they need to be made to feel uncomfortable. And her job in her flat emotionless monotone is to hammer that point home. Frankly I'm glad she's dead.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,Thinning the herd,"This is my first review and I made it because this series got such a high rating, and unfortunately some good reviews. Those good reviews are in some serious trouble, psychologically. This girl represents everything that's wrong with today's society. She's a suicide you hope for. She's that one about which you say: ""Good, world is a better place now"", those ""victims"". I don't know if U.S. sunk to that type of PC fascism that makes everyone around a awful human being blamed on that persons whim just because that person feels, subjectively that you harmed her. This story and this personality of Hannah can maybe make sense to people that wrote articles about how winning over a girl in a video game is rape, or those articles about how Battlefield 1 is sexist because it doesn't include female players, or even that about a male fetus being a rapist inside his mother, because his penis is inside his mother. This show and the main character have that kind of logic. If this character was a male, it would be a show about Elliot Rodgers, that's the level of Asperger's and narcissism presented in the show.The only motivation for making this show; because it's actually well made, with a big budget and a good cast; is that Illuminati decided to make a show that hopefully makes horrible people like the main character kill themselves, but it adds that twist where they suggest you should make innocent people suffer for no reason, but your lack of adjustment, classic Illuminati... which I condone, as is obvious, I hope. Really, it's a mockery of an act of suicide, or people have just became so shallow and so so meaningless and horrible, that this makes sense. I hope Elliot Rodger is not one of a lot, and if he is, I hope this thins the heard.",1
13 Reasons Why,Boring yet amusing,"What I want to really know is, the ""13 reasons why I actually watched this."" But I did. I thought the actors did an outstanding performance in this melodramatic long journey through this one girl's suicide. I thought the tape scenario was excellent for us folks who are an actual survivor of suicide. There were many loopholes I saw, and flashback scenes were excruciating. Seriously? Teens act like this? Go for coffee? Have teen mentors? I have a teen. Raised several. They are not like this.The main character Hannah, was cute, somewhat popular and placed herself into situations she didn't need to be in. It happens, and the first bad thing with Justin was justified. After that, it seemed like she was a bit petty. (except the end tape) Oh it was just as excruciating to watch as it is to keep reliving this show in my head. Why on earth did she write that poem, and why was she upset that it was published? She must have actually given that poem to that Magazine guy... What 17 year old boy can relate to his mom telling him about the case, plus she was the attorney???In any case, it is this viewer's assumption that this LONG and dull show ( and it is LONG) is a glorification for any teenage girl who thinks she can commit suicide and ""blame all those who made it happen"" - thus the thought of "" OKAY, THEY'LL BE SO SORRY WHEN I AM DEAD! HAHAHA I WILL MAKE THEM PAY!"" Good fodder for the next victim. Good for you, you TV people. It just doesn't make sense. The whole Tony guy, the broken friendships- ( that's life, kids) and the note of saying ""Best Ass""? It wasn't portrayed that she was a church going Mennonite, so what is that?This long series could have been surmised in one short sad movie. But yet, we bring on a second season- probably about a kid who kills all the popular kids at the school. Bad call, this show. Most of the time I wanted to tell this girl,(who seemed so spoiled that she wanted to kill herself over a few friends didn't go back for her when she yelled at them to leave her alone.)This isn't sympathetic to the suicide victim, but a punishment for anyone for who ever has been a survivor of a child, spouse, sibling, friend of a suicide. It's a poor stab at what we want to hear, but not an actual environment of teenage homes. What homes do you know that every parent is a ""eat at the table, let's say grace- and you are grounded, but not"" (Oh, sorry mom, I'll never do that again, okay? Okay, Honey- here, have some weed) OMG I am going nuts that this is on the air.",1
13 Reasons Why,"A glossy, glamorized way to talk about suicide","I've seen films glamorizing all sorts of stupid things, behaviors, beliefs etc.We can watch films depicting drug addicts as heroes, AIDS sufferers as victims of society, policemen and police in general as corrupt criminals and brutal criminals as saints. I even watched a film glamorizing ""poor"" pedophiles (Pervert Park), go figure! Examples are everywhere and every year film makers find something new to try and lower the limits of what was once acceptable.Now, this series seems to reach a new level of stupidity. No matter what people say that it is warning to a series of problems that teens can have, it is still a glossy, a rose-colored view of teen suicide. This is very, very disturbing. And still there are those who find value in this type of garbage.The whole series, the story and everything else besides the suicide is nauseating... It is the typical run-of-mill depiction of teen life and all of its annoying and moronic idiosyncrasies, idiotic characters, etc.",1
13 Reasons Why,Not ok,"The show was very graphic. As a social worker, I recognize it's important for the general population to be exposed to mental health and the sexual assault.

13 Reasons Why,If I could rate it 0 I would.,"This is getting way too much positive attention. This isn't 'brutally honest'. This is upright moronic. Suicide is being glorified and portrayed as a way to get revenge, which is not how it should be portrayed. It's a serious issue and there's so many holes in this story it's unbelievable. Hannah lacks serious self reflection and blames all her problems on her surroundings. Instead of trying to fix some of these problems and bring them to light, she decides to kill herself as a hollow statement that has little to no effect. If it wasn't for Clay having this unhealthy obsession with Hannah, the whole show wouldn't have had any legs to stand on. The show includes a ton of shallow and unlikable characters and even the main character is unlikable and drags out the show way more than needed. He lacks chatacter development which makes it feel as if we're barely progressing. The show is made to be shocking and some closeminded people may find this relatable in some way or another. Serious issues are brought up, some executed better than others, but the overall story lacks selfawareness and sends out mixed messages to impresionable people who may also struggle with any of the issues included in the show. If the show didn't focus on the glorification of suicide and revenge, it might actually have been worth a watch.",1
13 Reasons Why,Can it be any worse?,"What good is there to say? Terrible acting. Horrible script. It almost seems like a parody at times. I don't know how this ever got the green light, especially for a second season. No one in this series should ever get another job acting.

13 Reasons Why,Stop making this show,"This show gives no substance. All shock value. The writing and acting is terrible. Couldn't even make it through one episode. However, I unfortunately had to find out that it shows a girl literally slitting her wrists and dying. It shows a man getting raped bloody with a mop. It consistently shows other forms of rape and sexual assault. Why do the creators keep defending this as the only way to show ""real world scenarios""? We have seen suicide in other movies and shows. Why do we need to SEE the razor blade sliding into her forearm? This show is confusing ""advocating for the prevention of bullying and suicide"" with ""shock value for publicity and national attention"".
This show claims to think that this is how you teach people about issues when all it's doing is disgusting people with unnecessary graphic images, triggering people who have had to experience things like this, possibly even worse, and banking off of showing the ""real experiences"" of life because they know it will get attention. This show is disgraceful and the fact that Netflix hasn't pulled it is astounding.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
13 Reasons Why,Are they paying for positive reviews?,"I'll share some of my personal information that helped me arrive at the fury I have to this trash of a show.
Me and my family have been a part of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) since my father was victim to suicide. Though I'm in my 30s and have my own mental illnesses I deal with daily, I also have a high school son and college student brother. We did a lot for their schools.This show is slowly UNDOING all the actual good others do!Victims of suicide are VICTIMS. They get so lost in this dark hole and feel that's the best option for them. They do NOT blame others, they blame themselves for not being strong enough or not being good enough, etc.Hannah Baker was NONE of these things. She was a revenge fueled pity-party and the only reason I think they added the one and only bad thing that actually happened to her at the very end so anyone opposing this series is going to look like a horrible person.I'm risking that because one incident (sorry but WHY get in a hot tub with HIM, at night, alone? Are you f'ing kidding me?) does not make up for the horrible things she did. 13 tapes to 12 pretty innocent people.There are so many articles, YouTube videos, REAL in-depth looks to how this series is far more harmful than helpful. It's sad to see these clearly messed with ratings pausing it and I pray it does NOT ever receive any awards. (The acting, writing, story, camera work = absolute garbage.)",1
13 Reasons Why,Overrated Show,"This show is never ever a 8,2* series. I don't even think this deserves 5 stars. Hannah is just an annoying drama queen and instead of going straight she has to split the Story into 13 tapes? The way she is acting (personality not her acting skills) just makes me think no wonder you got bullied you stupid b*tch. I really really wanted to watch and like this because I wanted to understand the hype and was excited for a good new show but this was hard to watch and not rage. And wtf even more seasons coming?

13 Reasons Why,This show is so bad...,"This show borderline glorifies suicide. The acting is okay at best. There's no complex characters here whatsoever. It was an insult when I found out they were inspired to shoot the episodes the way they did by the fantastic show that is Season 1 of True Detective! Clay listens to these tapes at such a SLOW pace and it's exhausting to watch as a viewer. I know the show is called 13 reasons why but you DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE 13 SLOW EPISODES. There has been shows that have told complex stories with greatly developed characters in 10 episodes or less. The characters in this show have the typical jocks, cheerleaders, losers, loners, and it's such a clich√© and brings nothing new to the table of High School based shows. Hannah falls apart when the slightest thing doesn't go her way.She pushes Clay away CONSTANTLY and then wonders why he never put an S on his chest and saved her! She's see her best friend get raped and does nothing out of fear, I get that. But she never follows up on that?! She doesn't tell anyone?! How are we supposed to feel sorry for this character? You can tell this show is trying SO hard to make you feel sorry for her but how can you when she's such a drama queen?! I'd never recommend this show to ANYBODY. Anybody who's depressed or has had suicidal thoughts please please please please avoid this show since the content in it might convince them it's okay to harm themselves which is NEVER the case. They wanted to bring awareness about suicide but they have completely failed in delivering it properly.",1

13 Reasons Why,Opportunity wasted by poor writing,"13 Reasons Why tackled some very important topics facing students today and wasted the opportunity to properly address these issues. Instead of dealing with the issues they decided to write overly dramatic and unrealistic episodes, and show the teens dealing with the issues exactly how they should not while simultaneously supporting illegal and immoral acts....which was the complete opposite of what this series is supposed to be about.I feel that part of the problem with this series is too many episodes. Season 1 obviously required 13 episodes but season 2 and definitely season 3 could have been done in 8 episodes...especially with better writing. Hopefully the unfortunate decision to have a season 4 is corrected with better writing and a more realistic message.

13 Reasons Why,"Season 1 excellent, season 2 not too bad, season 3 was awful","This show started out great with season 1. It could have ended there. Season 2 wasn't as good, but still it had some very touching moments, but it also had some controversial scenes but they are nothing compared to season 3. It appears the writers and producers decided they had to go all ""Game of Thrones"" with the gratuitous sex scenes that aren't necessary. Yes, there were scenes of rape in season 1 but season 3 was just all-out sex scenes that were on the lines of Game of Thrones. Also, season 3 was just, well, awful. This was Scooby Doo rated X if you ask me. Characters that we know doing things they never would have done. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the things we see Alex do and many others made me have to wonder ""really?"". I know there is a season 4 and it's the final season. Not sure what else they can do, but season 3 was a mess. If you haven't seen this show, you can stop after season 1, but if you want to continue on, then season 2 should be as far as you go. Season 3 is just awful.

13 Reasons Why,"Unimpressive ""retelling"" of A Girl Like Her with an inferior cast","Copycat films (or shows) can be fine. ""Bait"" was more or less a copy of ""Enemy of the State,"" but was very well done with a sharp cast that made it almost as good. The same cannot be said, however, for ""13 Reasons Why,"" which hearkens back to the ""very special"" episodes of the 1970s, and the movies-of-the-week which would preempt them. Making us feel GUILTY for not watching something, as if we somehow contributed to poor Hannah Baker's suicide, is a tried-and-true marketing tactic for ""important"" fiction. Unfortunately for the audience, but fortunately for shareholders of Netflix, the series proves more than distribution kills superior independent work as efficiently as bullying killed Hannah.It's not clear how much ""A Girl Like Her"" was inspired by 13 Reasons, but the buzz created by that film (also on Netflix) certainly sparked interest in a big-budget version of this project, later abandoned and which would have had Selena Gomez in the lead. Gomez, a fine singing talent, and someone for whom the underlying issues have hit home, would have effectively been playing an exaggerated version of herself, without the intricate skillset required to pull off an emotionally-charged role in a manner which wins major awards.A show like this is going to rise and fall with the performance of its lead, in this case the very inexperienced Katherine Langford, an actress who is pretty enough, but clearly lacking in the nuance and depth which makes Lexi Ainsworth such a thrill to watch on General Hospital. A longtime fan of Lexi's, I was glad to see her career take a big step forward with her acclaimed performance in A Girl Like Her, only to watch that film's thunder be stolen much like life itself was taken from Hannah. Put simply, knowing what Lexi could have done with his material makes Katherine extremely painful to watch, but casting Lexi (as should have been done here) would have drawn attention to the similarities, so that must have been out.This show has the same annoying self-aware tone which torpedoed Riverdale, making the series almost a parody of itself. Even in the scenes which are supposed to drive Hannah to suicide, we see no genuine expressions of congruent emotions, but actors throwing tokens at these extremes as one might tokens at a turnstile. Crying on cue, relating to the audience, and actually FEELING the terror and horror experienced by someone like Hanna is a very specific acting skill Lexi possesses in boatloads, and Katherine Langhorn clearly does not. Because of this, 13 Reasons Why falls apart almost from the get-go, at let to the trained Hollywood eye, though the Netflix audience seems not to notice or care.13 Reasons Why is a good watch solely because others are watching it, and it has sparked discussions about important issues, but none of this was driven by memorable acting. I look forward to the day when an actress like Lexi, or the indies who produced A Girl Like Her, can get the muscle of a Netflix behind one of their projects, because if they ever did, the result would blow away a show like this, and the distribution would ensure that everyone in the world would know it.",1

13 Reasons Why,Season 3 is jumping the shark,"The Ani character did not make sense. She wasn't there and we already knew he was dead. To add her was stupid. Plus to make her British.

But the biggest failure is trying to make the rapist likable. People are multi faceted. Kids make mistakes. But this person raped repeatedly. They showed it in detail. That translates into who he was. The writers try to make him some sensitive message gender bender sender. He was a pen evil character. Should have kept it that way.

13 Reasons Why,"Not talking about two more seasons, the show is really really boring.","13 Reasons Why is one of those TV series which has high rating here on IMDB, but it's not a good show, not talking about great word. It might have awesome contents inside it, but the speed is too slow and made me boring. I watched it because it's sort of popular in 2017 when season 1 came out. But I found that the show was moving too slow and so, it's very very boring. After watching a few episodes, maybe three, I stopped watching.The main thing about this show is 13 reasons why Hannah committed suicide. If 13 reasons are known, the rest is nothing. Because of too drama and too slow, I can't continue to watch it anymore. It made me really really sleepy. So, I've stopped watching and began to search so-called 13 reasons online. Instead of watching the whole thing, reading those 13 reasons is better. That is the best decision I've made. I've saved a lot of time. If you don't want to lose your time, I advice you to do the same.As for season 2 and 3, I don't think they should continue this show. The show is already fixed. And Hannah is dead at the very beginning. The show is really done in season 1. If died, there's nothing can bring one back. Of course unless it's Sci-fi. Hence having 2 more seasons is kind of nonsense.Conclusion is that this show is really really boring. So, as for me, it's not even worth it watch it.",1

13 Reasons Why,Wrong premise to promote,"I suppose that every era has its own issues to promote via TV shows. Once it was Sexism, cigarettes, rock band life style. These days it's feminism (sometimes to a radical extent), racism (up to a reverse degree) and as this show that touches the subject of teenage psychology and the destructive consequences.I'm a bit old fashioned in my choices of a movies and shows. I believe that people should be judged not by their race or gender, but by their talents in various fields. That's why the pure fem fests and reverse racism movies bother me a bit. I simply refuse to feel guilty for being white, pretty successful male, with a happy and functional family. And I had to work very hard to get there. So I believe that those movies distort and misrepresent the reality and in some case even ruin entire genres with those attempts.This show is about teenagers and I think it's suppose to provide some sort of a lesson. Though I believe the lesson is incorrect and unsuitable for young generation. Instead of teaching the audience to be better and learn to deal with all the hardships that may come their way, as quoting Forrest Gump ""S... happens"", it indulges into a weakness of juvenile teenager who surrendered, blamed everything on everybody and ended her life. Is that the lesson that we want to teach our children? Not me. Shows of this type misguide and can lead to much bigger problems, when they will be required to be stronger and better, but they just wouldn't be able to do so.",1

13 Reasons Why,"Dangerous, repulsive, and not accurate by any means","Where do I begin with this show? It's SICKENING. This show is a repulsive joke. Of course Netflix can release an untruthful and harmful show about mental illness because so many people don't care enough to rid of the stigma behind it. This show makes it WORSE for people to seek help how have mental illnesses because it teaches how exactly NOT to display suicide on TV shows. It is a very dangerous show (not a positively ""daring show""). Shame on anyone behind this show. ***MILD BUT OBVIOUS SPOILER (it's in the first episode)*** SHOWING suicide like this in a show is actually encouraging it (it plants the idea and how to do it in a young person's brain). THIS IS NOT A TEENAGER SHOW AND IT DOES NOT REFLECT SUICIDE OR MENTAL ILLNESS ACCURATELY. The character that commits suicide NEVER ONCE tries to seek help, and uses suicide as a good REVENGE mechanism. The show's producers and directors ignored doctor's advice on how they should portray suicide and continued with it anyway. This is no Pretty Little Liars type show, and should not be treated as such. Shame on Netflix. You can teach young people about suicide without making it dangerous.",1
13 Reasons Why,Just stay away from this unless you want to get sick.,Story about some school kids who have a lot of time around and they just waste it on ridiculous nonsense. When do they even study? No they don't. Why do they even have time for all this. Just what kind of school was that? This show will do awful things to your mind. The main female character was really annoying. The things shown in this are way too unrealistic. The whole story was like almost revealed in just first 1 or 2 episodes. But I just kept on watching to see some plot twist. I only wish I could get my time back.2 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
13 Reasons Why,Season 1 good. Then became social/political drivel,"First season - good stuff about why Hannah killed herself. BUT later season (ESP season 3) really became about left social and political agendas and the real storyline was pushed FAR back in favor of the agenda driven messages. Season 3 was just about pushing a very biased message and nothing else. It really was just an over the top, in-your face here's our message from the writers. No thanks.

13 Reasons Why,WOW this is AWFUL!,"Now, I liked the book of 13 Reasons Why, so I went in to this as optimistic as I could. However I just could not like this. The book depicted very honest depictions of suicide, depression and grief, the show makes it uncomfortable and handles it VERY poorly. Things like having Hannah cut herself instead of swallowing a handful of pills and Clay getting in a car accident are put in here to make it different, but it just ends up looking like a poor attempt at making the show edgier and more appealing to teens. But you know what was appealing to teens and was very good? The friggin' book, that's what! I guess season one is technically fine but I felt very little emotion in it. However, season two is complete and utter garbage. The first season was based off of the book that had no sequel, so why make a season two to an adaptation??? It's not the fact that season two exists that bugs me, it's that it's just so awful. It completely loses the plot and it's just an absolute mess. I could PROBABLY recommend the first season to someone who's got a different taste than mine and doesn't mind the fact that they don't treat the subject of suicide with as much respect that the book gave it. But other than that, this is a below average series that I hate. Avoid this if you can but since this is a spoiler review I don't think you want to find out anyway or you've seen the show. And if you have seen it? Read the book. Already have? Then agree that it's better than this tripe.",1
13 Reasons Why,Good gone bad!,"I was intrigued to watch the show at first, the soundtrack and the direction were amazing and powerful. But the downfall was that we couldn't see a convincing reason other than Hannah over reacting and killing her self for no OBVIOUS REASON AT ALL!!!!!!! it could have been better if she faked her death or it was a murder perhaps, but starting off as suicide and torturing herself and others around her for foolish reasons, it is pure SICKNESS and it surely ruined the rhythm of the show.

13 Reasons Why,A leap in the wrong direction,"The show is doable sure i wasnt bored or anything but i wasnt exactly taken away with the story.
My reasoning for rating the show so low is not with the show itself but rather with what the show does to society. It has made mental illmess and suicide less taboo and as a result these subjects are everywhere in social media now. Yes this was alredy happening but this show is part of a movement that i personally find to be bad for everyone. I fear for my own children should they ever be born that they will have to grow up constantly hearing about how depressed people are. Its unhealthy.

I'm a teenager and when I watched this serie I literally was depressed. It's too realistic! The things that happened to Hannah happen to many teenagers and the fact that the serie doesn't have an happy ending could make a troubled teenager think that maybe suicide is the right choice. It deals with pretty serious issues in a totally indelicate way. Problems like this need to be faced in a different way, not with negativity and agony like this serie does.

13 Reasons Why,"This show does not portray the seriousness of suicide, it's a joke.","Don't have words to describe how inappropriate this show is to the topic of suicide. This show completely gives an OK to teenagers committing suicide everyday in America. This sets a horrible example to young kids watching this show, making it an acceptable problem and solution for teens combating depression every day. Making high school issues as an acceptable excuse to doing such a horrific act, and blaming other people for what they chose to do, is unbelievably and disgustingly unacceptable. There are so many people all over the world combating depression, and so many have a million worse reasons to commit suicide, but they chose not to everyday. Showcasing some American kid, combating life in high school, does not truly portray the seriousness of the issue of suicide and depression. This show makes a joke out of the topic, and it is repulsive.2 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

13 Reasons Why,13 reasons why not to watch this drivel,"The starting premise of this series is excruciating enough - a girl is raped so she causes misery and chaos by leaving tapes behind her when she kills herself. This is more than enough material for a mini-series, but the producers cruelly drag this out for four - yes four - seasons. Every possible teen angst angle is introduced, leaving the inevitable conclusion that the school should be shut down and most of the students institutionalised, either in prison or mental hospital. I was forced to watch much of this rubbish as my wife became mesmerised by the awfulness of the thing. It is highly ""politically correct"" (even including white supremacist allegations, student riots, serious mental illness, drug use etc). The increasingly aged ""youths"" are a joke - and the main actor, Dylan Minnette - cannot act to save his life, always having the same lost expression, like a rabbit in car headlights.

13 Reasons Why,Horrible,"Before watching the show, I read the book, and it was fantastic. I loved it, hell, I'd even consider it the most well paced, exciting, and enjoyable books I've ever read, and I was really excited to watch the show. But the first episode alone was the most painful 50 minutes of my life. Within those 50 minutes, they made changes to it that really irritated me. Like making Tony talk to Clay earlier on about the tapes made no sense. And the time line is broken, and it would've been better if they had it take place over the course of one night, and have a big conflict and the end or something. I can relate this to a time where a movie was made out of a book, and may have even been better than the book: The Shinning. The Shinning is one of my favorite movies of all time. And yes, they made several changes to it such as Wendy's hair color, their car, and getting rid of some scenes that may have been important. But what The Shinning does good that 13 Reasons Why(The show) fails at is that The Shinning doesn't ruin all the characters(As a matter of fact, they brought them to life perfectly). In the book, Clay is a popular and well known for being a nice kid, making it interesting as popular kid realizes his flaws and betters himself. He and Hannah never had any conflicts except for at the party, but in the show he was mean to her a few times, and is socially awkward(Not sure how that adds to the series, but okay). A few other characters that were ruined were Tony and Hannah, and it's just a total mess. Yes watch it if you haven't read the book, because that way it won't ruin it for you, But if you read the book and enjoyed, avoid 13 Reasons Why at all costs.",1

The fact that high school isn't what it used to be, and how it's unfortunately getting worse. The show did effect me in a big way, also gave me a deeper knowledge in what to look for for those silently struggling. The important thing to remember is that, we all struggle. There is help!

Anyway lets go straight to plot, its not good. Why? well everything in the movie that the characters do is ONLY to progress the plot, they have no motive of their own, no agency to do anything. And this is sad because its used to be the key theme of MiB, an agent who saves people, but no one knows he exists and he is in contact with the whole of the Universe but still finds himself ALONE in the Universe. That struggle is what used to set MiB agents like Jay apart from others.How did they mess this up again?. This is simple stuff, just cast Will Smith, or is he not black enough?.
Hemsworth and the black chick, dont know her name, were ok but it was too high school slice of life material. There's the tall hunky pretty white boy who is a dumb bimbo and the quirky nerdy black chick who is intelligent and knows everything, EVERYTHING, even when she gets alien weaponry that according to the movie she shouldnt have knowledge about or on, she knows it, just like that.Like a friend used to say there is a scientist and a movie scientist, two different kind those. See if a movie scientist was a molecular biologist, he can do xenomorph anatomy AND highly complex neuro-engineering AND merge brains together, but a real scientist would reply ""err i do not possess the necessary skills as a simple biologist to construct an alien brain merging machine"".

Men in Black: International,Not one redeeming factor,"Everything is so damaging to the original. Every single character feels like they don't belong in an MIB movie and instead are there just to bother the viewer. Meanwhile with Will Smith who was cool led the viewer in first a horror/sci fi, then a comedy, and then a drama. This film feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a blend between a children's comedy with a little bit of sci fi in there. Overall the film just doesn't hold up well at all.26 out of 42 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Men in Black: International,Extremely disappointing,"This movie was a mistake. Letting 2 inexperienced Transformers movie writers solo this project was a terrible idea, and whoever let this happen should be held accountable. Kumail Nanjiani did a great job with comic relief, with the lines he was given, but nothing could make up for the unfathomably underdeveloped dialogue. I hope the franchise owners can take responsibility for this travesty; a formal apology would go a long way.P.S. I don't blame any of the actors although I do think Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson should feel at least a little bit embarrassed.21 out of 33 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Men in Black: International,Nothing to do with the original MIB movies,"If you liked the original MIB movies with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, this one has nothing to do with that. This movie just tries to exploit the brand to the extreme, building ""cool"" new aliens, new weapons, new alien races and extending the MIB organization internationally.
I was bored to my bones watching this movie, I had to take my cell phone out to play just so that I wouldn't fall asleep. They want to showcase Chris Hemsworth all the time, showing how handsome and smart he is, to the point where it just becomes ridiculous.

Men in Black: International,I guess..,"I will do this very objectively. The movies itself was a joke to a very good memory I had to the past movie. Why the hell are they flicking the feminist propaganda into every anticipated movie. In almost no movies in the past were there any intended jokes or other offensive comments in scenes about women. The way she said the jokes were literally planned for her to say them with haughtiness and a bit of contempt. Just remember when she said MIB, she just had an expression on her face that just screamed ""oh does that means that women are not included in the club, are we not up to the task, are we so worse than MEN, WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS TO WIB"". What the hell is their problem for ruining a great movie with such childish thinking and acting.
This way of filming other future movies will just ruin and mock all the old hits of good movies. I hope that the bad rating will help them re-think the way they direct these movies because it will just ruin the thinking of growing children (especially girls) and the anticipated older generation.23 out of 40 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Men in Black: International,I'M HONEST SO MY COMMENTS MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO SOME PEOPLE,"Men In Black without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones? Does Hollywood has no decent script writers ans scripts that is trying so desperately to cash on past glories? (SONY, Columbia, don't care which studio) And it is no more men, now it is men and women. New agent, yeah, new partner, how politically correct are we. Did #MeToo made some phone calls while the cast was selected? Tessa, at least pump some muscle girl, U R a doll but U still look like Valkyrie in The Avengers and Thor. A black suit and a pair of shades don't make U a ... er ... a Woman In Black? And man, all that rap, rap, lousy rap music. Annoying. Will was much better. His was good.
Rip Torn is dead, so let's shift to good old faithful England (switch in a moment to the Middle East to please someone) and pull Liam Neeson, he looks like a trustworthy character and an action guy. Gee, he's Irish, well it don't matter for this case. Emma Thompson (she's Brit alright) probably did this for some cash and so did Gary, probably. Dude U were great directing The Negotiator and The Italian Job. Why this? And Chris, stick to what U R really good at man, OK Thor?
They tried to make it so funny that it wasn't funny. Too many anticipated cliches. It was boring despite some lotsa CGI action. Too much.
I don't see the Academy talking about Cedric's designed statuette for this ... Men & Women In Black all over the World.
I'll skip this one from my Men In Black BR collection.

Men in Black: International,This movie is for children..,"..very stupid children. Or maybe babies, to get them to them sleep.
Blind and deaf - people would be another great demographic.This garbage can be referred to as Ghostbusters (2016) Number 2, not just because it's extremely close to fecal matter, but also because it pays cheap lip service to ideologies and temporary issues of politics without understanding or even trying to understand their implications.
It comes of like an actual alien with no understanding of human culture or social norms pathetically trying to relate to you and your humanness.And if that wasn't a hard enough pill to swallow, they inexplicably chose to fill the whole runtime to the brim with sexual innuendo, terrible jokes only a paid audience would laugh at and the worst action and special effects since Ghostbusters (2016). All the interactions feel forced, characters and motivations are either stupid, clich√© or unexplained.The script is nonexistent.
If someone told me this was written by a dopey twelve year old I would believe them without question.
By the end nothing makes sense and not a single action beat feels intense, emotional or earned. Nobody grows or changes and the whole thing didn't matter at all.It looks cheap, sounds cheap, feels cheap but somehow cost 110 million dollars to produce. Which once again solidifies the idea that it's not about how big your stick is, it's about how hard you can hit with it.Overall, put this thing in the dumpster where it belongs and do not watch this unless you want a brain aneurysm.",1

Men in Black: International,Don't ignore any reviews. They're all right.,"I personally hated this film. Hated it so much it gave me a heartburn. But that's because it's completely in-line with the current trend of ""let's have a multicolored diarrhea all over the nostalgia factor"". Yes, there was a pun there. Inappropriate gender/race change is hip these days, but it seems that while that MAY be passable with good script/acting, there's an interesting insistence on not doing that at all. This film is just one of many examples of that trend.Having said all of the above, one must remember these are different times we live in. While as kids of the 80-90s we loved good, well structured stories with compelling characters we could relate to. Not because of what they looked like, but because of their struggles and choices. These are the times where the struggles and choices of characters ARE all about what they look like, and that also supposed to make up the story. When that is taken into consideration, then the movie is ok. But I still hated it.15 out of 26 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Men in Black: International,22 Years Later,"The first MIB movie came out in 1997 - it was original, exciting, and hilarious. Will and Tom really sold it to audience worldwide.Now fast forward 22 years later, with all the technical advancements in the film industry, the new ""MIB International"" felt empty, pointless, and extremely boring. There wasn't one genuine attention grabbing moment in the entire 2 hours,Chris is charming, but his performance was shallow, Agent H was more like a playboy than hero. Tessa is supposed to be the new girl power that is a breath of fresh air into the man dominated world. It'd be great, except we have seen nothing of the sort. She didn't demonstrate wittiness, resolve, mental or physical strength to be the new generation of agent that the show is supposed to deliver. Her performance overall is blend.The screen play was badly written, ladled with holes bigger than the galaxy. Directing was so bad.

Men in Black: International,Poorly executed.,"For those complaining that the film was bad because it did not have an all white all male cast (neither did the originals), that has zero to do with why the film was terrible.It comes down to poor execution on almost all counts.

The plot was bad.
The jokes were not funny.
The film was therefore boring and cringe worthy.Hemsworth and Thompson have good chemistry and are fantastic actors but even they could not save this movie.

Men in Black: International,Men in Bleh-ck,"There's an easy joke for a critic of this film to make: ""I wish I could use that mind-erasing neuralyzer to forget how bad this movie is!"" That reference is not only hacky, but irrelevant. For something to be erased from your memory, it must have some sort of impact on your brain. This 20+ year old franchise has always been hit-and-miss, but it's never been this boring. Men in Black: International is so utterly unremarkable and forgettable that it basically works as its own mind-erasing neuralyzer.
Spinning off from the original trilogy following Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, we find new, precocious MiB recruit Tessa Thompson being shown the ropes by a less-than-enthusiastic elder agent in Chris Hemsworth. Hilarity is supposed to ensue from there, but unfortunately this is a classic case of the best moments existing in the trailer; even more unfortunately, those trailers aren't good.
It all suffers from an anemic script that offers nothing of value to a franchise that should've stayed dormant. None of the storytelling shows a hint of passion or care by the filmmakers, painting in cliched plot points and nonsensical character moments just to simply get from one moment to the next. Worst of all, it's oppressively unfunny, substituting actual humor for annoying sarcasm and side-eyed cynicism.
It's desperately missing the dry delivery of Jones and charismatic strength of Smith. Not that Thompson and Hemsworth aren't talented, but they don't have the specific skills to elevate such wretched material; though I'm not sure anyone would. With sci-fi this uninspired, a mystery this uninteresting, and comedy this lazy, MiB: International is one of the most unwatchable movies I've seen in awhile.",1
Men in Black: International,MIB-mind is blunted,"Just finished this torture of a movie and left the theatre feeling supremely dejected. After all the reasonably good work done by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, here comes a mega burn to the franchise.
You start watching the movie with great expectations, and that's where it ends... You while out every excruciating minute waiting for something genuinely exciting to happen.. and it never does.
Thor and valkyrie outside the MCU are meh.. And there's no denying that sad truth.
Probably the best character in the movie was the CGI 'pawny'.
God save us all .
Chris... honestly, please don't do this to yourself after your awesome performance as Thor in the MCU.

Men in Black: International,Horrible absolutely worse than the worst British comedy,"Whatever would make them think that this idea was great is beyond me absolutely horrible movie I wondered why that Will Smith did not return and now I see why even he could see it was a horrible idea. The graphics are horrible, plot line is flat with no character building just flat characters throughout the entire movie
The entire movie is just resting on the laurels of the previous movie. Would have gave it a negative rating if possible6 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Men in Black: International,A disgrace to the MIB history,"To be honest I walked out after about 50 mins, just after the alien dying in the car and giving the girl something, so can't say anything after that.

Men in Black: International,Men in Black: International Review,"This film is complete garbage. There are only two aspects of the film that I found decent at best. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson have great chemistry together and Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, and Liam Neeson do an okay job acting. That's where the positives stop. Here are the loads of negatives. The editing in this movie is awful. Scenes just abruptly end out of nowhere with no context. Some shots are shown multiple times in different angles and it is super annoying. Some shots make no sense. There is a desert scene and all of a sudden, it cuts to a picture of the moon for 3 seconds. There is literally no point to scene. The visual effects are bad. They are not complete garbage but they aren't good either. The aliens look extremely fake and it gets distracting sometimes. The original Men In Black movie may have some dated effects but most are better in that movie than in Men in Black: International. The characters suck. Liam Neeson is a terrible villain and his character has no motivation. He wants to take over the world just because. Both Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson's characters also don't have any motivation to do anything other than they are told to. The supporting characters suck. Rebecca Ferguson's character was only used for pointless action while the other supporting characters just suck in general. The film isn't funny at all. I didn't laugh at one joke. Each joke is painfully unfunny. The script sucks. Every line of dialogue feels forced and unnatural that you want to claw your hair out. The story and structure sucks. It tries to be this mystery movie but the film is so predictable that it loses any mystery. The film jumps from place to place with no rhyme or reason other than to move the story forward unnaturally. The tone is inconsistent. Some scenes are trying to be serious but are undercut by a comedic joke or some other conflicting tone. The pacing also sucks. Some scenes are so slow and others are just way too fast. Save your money and don't watch this garbage. Use that money to just rent the original film instead. Overall, Men in Black: International may have good chemistry between the lead actors but fails at recapturing the craziness of the original film. I give Men in Black: International a 1/10.",1

Men in Black: International,An Honest Review,"Well... this was another sequel that no one asked for, at all and we can probably honestly say that this is a huge reason why it flopped.I had absolutely no interest in seeing another sequel of MIB, especially one without Will Smith, and especially one that is gender-swapped and rests closer to the reboot mark than the remake mark.Which are all reasons why I didn't see it until it came around for free.And as predicted while all but rebooting the franchise, it also attempts to make a political statement with the jokes coming from ""laugh because you agree with this"" type of humor, which rarely actually lands. And as a result it feels like SNL doing MIB in a sequel no one asked for.8 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Men in Black: International,Sloppy Writing and Story Line,"I loved the past three MIB's but I have to admit that they are not known for their story line. However, I found the Men in Black International script writing sloppy and they even insult our intelligence! For example in 24:00, the lights go out and they claim that the problem is in the fuses, then the character comments, "" Pay your bills then!"" (24:11). How does a burnt fuse relate to unpaid electricity bills? I HATE THAT! The story line was run in the mill type that is instantly forgettable and most of its acting feels forced.",1
Men in Black: International,A weak movie and predictable,If only those who make movies knew that making sequels and spin offs just milks the success of what made the first movie interesting and fun.Men In Black from 1997 is still a better movie than it sequels and this spin off movie really hurt what made the first movie fun.The writing is very flat and the comedy feels forced and I'm so sick of people wanting movies to be PC Politically correct that makes movies not fun when you get upset about the simple thingsThe acting of the movie is very lame and you can see in most of the eyes of the cast that they did the movie for a paycheck.The story is just predictable as you know the villains before it is reveal how pathetic. The movie just really spit in your face as far as entertaining goes while forcing its Agenda down your throat. This movie will never been allow in my home it was the world dollar I've spend on a ticketIf you really want to enjoy a Men in Black movie stick with the first movie because this is another example of a fell spin off and a movie that gets many sequels just hurts the storyline and interest in the series. Now this is the official fourth movie in the series I'm done I be happy to see this series stopped.I give Men In Black International 1 out of 10,1

Man I couldn't agree more with the 1 star rating this corruption of mib franchise that it is... Tessa Thompson was the only watchable actor, the others were just there as a further insult to the mib franchise. Hemsworth is painful to watch, he's just good for Thor.

Men in Black: International,Tessa Thompson shines in this; Hemsworth is beyond terrible,"I've been a big fan of Tessa Thompson since Thor Ragnarok. I thought it wasn't a good movie but I really liked her performance. Watching MIB: International, I realize finally that Chris Hemsworth is the real problem. He can't act. I think like Idris Elba, the potential is there but they've reached a certain level and just don't feel they need to take it seriously at all. I was thinking that if at some point, Hemsworth's character just disappeared, Thompson could have carried the movie and it would have improved.Another issue with the film is just Sony's sterile production values. I don't know what it is, but something is off with their films. I want to say that everything feels color by numbers and soulless. They're cheaping out on something but I can't put my finger on it. Maybe everything is green screened like crazy and actors don't know what is around them, so their reactions are off.This movie really does fall under the category of ""Average Fanboy Could Have Made a Much Better Movie."" The MIB franchise is such a great universe, why has only ONE of the installments been any good? Seriously. Maybe it's time for a creative reboot, I don't know. Keep Tessa Thompson, send Hemsworth packing. Maybe it's time to recast Thor as well. With a man! I feel terrible having to say that these days too because the ""woke"" stuff has gotten ridiculous.Not even worth your time, TBH.",1

The poster of this movie just screams bad. It asks a serious question, what if Thor and Valkyrie were MIB agents? There's a joke gone bad. Besides that here's just one more joke I'm saying for humor. Why would Molly be an agent with Men in Black, it's not Women in Black! üòÇOkay, back to the movie, it's not as well thought out as the previous three. Yes, I know the second one had sour moments, but it's more watchable than this because it explains how K got his memory back for the third film.

But there is none within the CIA. So she quits the CIA too.Then she just walks into the MIB building and asks to join. So they team her with the agent that they say repeatedly, is the best agent in the history of the MIB. Who is actually a bungling idiot who couldn't even tie his own shoe laces together.Imediately she saves his life repeatedly, tells him what to do as he doesn't know, and knows things about the MIB she couldn't possibly know....Why.....Who knows, because shes a women again??I am sick and tired of Hollywood turning 80s and 90s classics into these stupid female propaganda tropes with women being the worst types of Mary Sues imaginable in them.",1

Men in Black: International,"""Play and Human potential"" a book's title that makes you think","I ref. this because the movie ft. loads of humorous bits mostly from Agent H. But this basically is at odds with just working on things because things don't get done on their own. So play? Or work? What's the correlation by dammit: it's just what unrolls itself to you like a carpet. H is played by this delightful chap who's in those Marvel movies, because he is this nonstop delightful person throughout. The movie goes to lengths for him utilizing a humor to drive the movie along into entertainment. Prior there were some trailers for other movies, Terminator showing beardy Arnold opening the door as if it's just him opening the door actually to his place. But looks dope. Another Spiderman with him just talking friendly with the villain(?). The next trailer is the guard guy protecting the dopey Prez who goes ""(whiny)Uhhhhhuh (dopey)idk whats going on"" series which looks like a video game with all these drones exploding and security being a total embarrassment once more that he has to be this super agent, also ft. Nick Nolte appearing purposely in the woods with proximity mines, looking like unmasked Jason from Friday the 13th Part II.Anyway this flick has lots of things out of nowhere seemingly. A sentence given is ""have you ever abanonded logic for passion"" is compelling. WHOA. There's this scene where they keep detaching all this crazy looking silvery weaponry from parts of their car blowing away the badguys and it's like from a video game as they get a diff gun and just stand around letting loose more blasts while the badguys are further down the street standing around conveniently and we get to check out different blasts but at least the audience can be dumbly dazzled by all these effects, Yawn. But forget all those artsy 'seat of despair cineasts', just lay back and enjoy it like a dumb**** yokel.Another wise sentence is how M says passion is just a ""chemical reaction"" and wants to just be logical while H responds that the universe is a chemical reaction. Damn. This is like the arguments between McCoy and Spock in Trek while Kirk just is amused by their feud. Towards the end there's the switcheroo tactic of narrative of who you think is not so etc which seems kinda like a used up tactic but hey yaknow it's like whatever at that point if you get up to that point in the movie by then you're already made up your mind what you think of it. Why do I rate this so is because I am not offended by anything in the movie, there's a lot of dumb fun but at this point it's just better than like loads of duller movies, also never into this series' other movies because I didnt care for those leads, be honest does anyone? aside from their box-office to groupthink you into believing that? But here the leads are manageable. Someone says 'the universe has a way to lead you to where you need to be', another quote for the textbooks. My mom remarks that a lot of the plot is kind of a mess to keep up with and I agree with this remark. THIS is a dumb as heck movie, and I enjoy it not giving an iota if things make sense but just getting things from point A to point B and they even have the characters mention how they enjoyed riffing off each other, that's probably what they just figured to do to make it entertaining for the movie itself.",1

Parasite,Trying to Be Intellectual But Not Succeeding,"This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one.72 out of 128 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Parasite,"Long, with inconsistent characters and no moral compass","This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent.",1

Parasite,Overrated,"I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie.131 out of 260 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Parasite,Just a really bad movie..........,"When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry.
This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters.
It's a simple hype job.
The movie here is the real Parasite.32 out of 56 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Parasite,I still can't believe I finished to watch this 'film',"Worst movie by far I have ever watched.
Plot is absolute crap, predictable and boring.

Parasite,WTF is this???,"I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)34 out of 60 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Parasite,Extremely absurd without basic logic,"Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket.",1
Parasite,"One of the worst movies of 2019, I don't get the hype","I'm sorry, am I missing something here? Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking ""thumbs down.""Don't waste your time, trust me on this.I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it.",1

Parasite,Not for me,"PARASITE (2019)I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing.19 out of 33 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value.

And Parasite is technically not bad at all.However when watching a movie, it is quite rewarding to find some constructive citicism and good morals and principles. Well, in Parasite all you see is a man criticize at the way society works, with its undeniable flaws but, in the most destructive way I have ever seen. As he purposely doesn't leave room for good as he does for evil.As Frank Capra said 90 years ago: ""all cried: Emancipate our films from morality... Kill for thrill-shock! Shock! To hell with the good in man""That is why to me ""It¬¥s a wonderful life"", ""Up"", ""Lord of the rings"", ""Jojo rabbit"", ""Lemans 66"", ""Ordinary people""... while thay may be technically worse movies than parasite, are a whole universe better than what Bong Joon Ho could ever dream.",1

Add the unnecessary vulgarity and violence and I was sorry I wasted my money. Both families were trash in their own special way. I left feeling pretty dirty by the experience. I'm not naive about human behavior, but in a day where the media pushes divisiveness, I felt like it was driving the wedge deeper by promoting hatred and distrust between the rich and poor.

Parasite,Seriously Flawed,"It is incomprehensible to me that this film is acclaimed and possibly heading for an Oscar.The primary flaw are the subtitles. The dialog has been translated by a poor cousin of Google Translate and NEVER reviewed by someone who speaks English. Grammar is out the window. Literal word translations miss the meaning. Subtitles are often flashed up so quickly that a native English speaker doesn't have time to read them.The result of this subtitle travesty is that the plot is very hard to understand, particularly the mid-movie plot twists. The overall plot is clear by the movie's end and decidedly unremarkable.The cinematography is excellent. The actors seem competent but reminiscent of Jackie Chan.Overall rating a one ... of course the Hollywood sophisticates will disagree. Don't bother watching this unless you understand Hangul.",1
Parasite,The story of King's invisible clothes,"The credit of 8 Oscars and praises of all the critics makes you to watch through the movie and hope to finally get stunned by some spectacular element or surprise, but instead the more you go forward with the movie, the more you get disgusted by the superficial and typical story which you one can easily guess the next event which of course you assume that it would be the most stupid thing that can follow!

Parasite,Shocked at the Positive Reception,"I went into this movie with very high hopes. So many accolades and Oscars have been thrown at this movie, and while that's not the main requirement for a great movie, it gives off the impression that there has to be SOME redeeming qualities about it. I was excited to see a foreign-language film win Best Picture and was fully prepared to at least enjoy the movie as a social commentary, as many people lauded it as a powerful work of art and ""masterpiece"" (a word that is used WAY too often these days).So basically, I hated it. I got about an hour and a half into the film before my mom and I decided we had enough and couldn't succumb ourselves to watching the rest of this cartoonish sequence of events, despite the fact that I rented it. I could state a plethora of reasons for despising the film but to summarize my thoughts, I felt that the characters were underdeveloped and acted more like caricatures than real people we encounter, the film's aesthetic was not pleasing for the viewer to watch (and I understand that the movie's uneasiness was the point but I was not a fan of the directing style and the strange shots) and I kept thinking some bizarre creature was gonna come out and fully push this film into fantasy/horror genre. I just really did not like anything about it. I usually always finish movies once I'm dedicated to watching something but this was just impossible. I get some of the messages the director was trying to make but it comes off as a complete joke to me that this film won so many awards, including BEST PICTURE. None of the characters were likable. Absolutely none. I'm not sure if I was supposed to hate the rich family for just being rich and slightly conceited and root for the poor family because of their circumstances, but they didn't seem to have any empathy or compassion for even other working-class people like them in the pursuit to get what they wanted which came off as very cold and sad. I love films that make you question who the protagonists and antagonists are and I know not all movies are meant to be uplifting, but these characters were lazily written and we don't get any insight into their inner monologue and feelings. The acting was very mediocre for the most part too and sometimes downright cringe-worthy.I truly don't know what I missed but this was just not my cup of tea (or my mom's) and it felt unnecessarily gruesome and strange rather than masterful and sharp. Instead of awaiting the next moment with excitement and suspense, I found myself cringing at the actors' performances as they weren't believable and was confused at how poorly-written the dialogue was. Not everything that's out there and different hits the mark. This did NOT hit the mark for me.",1
Parasite,RIDICULOUS - WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,"How the hell did this garbage win the best film award? Better yet, how was it even nominated?
It was so horrible, I stopped watching after the first 15 minutes. Poor acting! Very basic story without a plot. Worst of all, who wants to read captions and listen to this other language.
I look at all these other reviews with 10s and elaborate comments, and I wonder what exactly people are thinking! It is shameful that the Academy allowed this foreign film to compete against all the other amazing films of the year.

This film is visually dull and predictable. The characters are uni-dimensional and unrealistic, and the plot is beyond implausible It is Kung Fu Hustle without all the charm and CGI.

Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings.

Parasite,Well filmed but trivial story,"Firstly, two warnings:
1. No real spoilers below.
2. My wife and I did not like this film at all (but note we also hated Pulp Fiction and Little Miss Sunshine which were also very popular with many people).The cinematography was excellent. Beautifully filmed and showing bits of Sth Korean life that I had never seen. Of course, some aspects, the unemployed family and the wealthy family themselves were probably atypical.We both thought the story and most scenes were quite ""old style"": trite, contrived and quite trivial. The film didn't venture into slapstick thank goodness but the lines and jokes were simple old ones transposed into a modern setting. I chuckled slightly ONCE during the film. Just not my sort of humour (give me ""Kives Out""). In terms of drama it was a bit like watching grass grow, OK interesting grass but that was all.The ending had a strong message but was executed in a completely over the top and ridiculous manner, and out of all context (style-wise) with what preceded.I can understand why a lot of people loved this film, and laughed a lot (although noone else was laughing in the cinema when we viewed the film). It has some strong elements in it but just dragged out too thinly for me.Worth seeing this film just in case it is your thing.",1

Parasite,I needed to read the 1 stars this time.,"I couldn't wait to watch this film after reading several 10 ratings reviews before, but after watching it today I've been compelled to agree with almost everything the 1 stars are saying here today.The film did not live up to being a great Korean film, or best anything, and especially not Oscar worthy, where the only thing I enjoyed about this film was that view from their living room because the plot was an insult on a few levels.And I'm not sure if anyone else had the same issues I had with the subtitles being extremely small to the point I was squinting trying to read the lines while watching it on Amazon Fire tv. That was a first for me, nevertheless, I understood enough to know that this movie was highly overrated!What a huge let down, I think I want my 4.99 back.",1

Parasite,Poor is the new great (it seems),"I watched Parasite with an open mind. I deliberately avoided reviews (far too many fake ones out there) and even the trailer. After sitting through it, a film that in all honesty made two hours seem like three, then coming onto IMDB to see what others thought, I'm astonished. Let's begin with the positives though - cinematography was good, acting was okay(ish)... and that's about where it ends. The negatives are considerable though: A weak script which often made little sense or logic, more plot holes than Swiss cheese, ridiculous scenarios that defied belief and an ending that completely falls off a cliff edge and leaves the viewer wondering why they wasted two hours on this drivel. In reality I'd probably rate it a 4/10, but as at time of writing Parasite sits at 8.5/10, which is farcical given how weak this film is, I'm giving it a 2 to try and restore a bit of balance and common sense. I am gobsmacked at how many on here are rating this a 10 and can only presume that it's down to a complete lack of quality movie experience or, more likely, that some are so oversaturated in the endless stream of CGI comic book garbage we've all been subjected to over the last decade+ that anything, ANYTHING that strays from the rut immediately garners a flailing of arms and lauding of ""Best film EVER!!!"" Thirty years ago this film would've been where it deserved towards the low end of the barrel, but in today's distinctly subpar cinema offerings it's now being tipped as on Oscar possibilty. Utterly ridiculous. For those of you who are praising this film as the best thing since sliced bread, go and get yourselves a film education. A good place to start is Claude Berri's marvelous 'Jean de Florette' and 'Manon des Sources' to see how it should be done. Films you actually don't want to end, rather than praying for them to finish one hour in.",1

Parasite,Opens well only to become an epic fail,"As a fan of foreign films I was excited to watch this after its Oscar success, but unfortunately it collapsed in its second half -- so badly I had to abandon viewing it.The opening of the film, introducing the starving Kim family and their machinations to secure work as the household staff of the Park family. It beautifully demonstrates the life in the city slums, with superbly executed plots to get the Parks' existing staff fired and replaced with the Kims. These plots become progressively more cruel, showing the Kims' slide into villainy.The complication arrives when the former head maid asks the Kims if she can retrieve something from the Park house. Here the Kims truly become villains, manipulating the secrets of the house for their own gain and even turning to overt violence to preserve their position. It is here that the film loses its way.Though certainly the Kims and their rivals have difficult choices to make, they are depicted as being gratuitously cruel. Each faction needs to remove obstacles, of course; each faction shows no restraint, fine. But the film lingers on this wickedness for so long, the audience becomes estranged to all of them. We no longer care about ANY of these characters because they have all become monsters; we abandon watching their fight because we have better things to do with our lives.The failure of this film (as with so many of the last few decades) is in the writing and editing. The sets are beautiful, the camerawork superb. But the film lingers on human suffering purely for the shock factor. The suffering of the Kims is sadly reality for those at the bottom of South Korean society, and desperation makes villains of us all, but this is not a documentary. This is meant to be entertainment, something people can enjoy. Angela's Ashes depicted similar levels of poverty yet still maintained the sympathy of the audience.",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,The worst Transformers movie,"This movie is like a big story put up in one paragraph with no punctuation marks whatsoever. Usually Transformers builds up a simple story that explodes into one big final battle, filled with special effects and epic fights between autobots and decepticons; pretty entertaining to watch, especially if you're into big explosions- action-robots-movies¬Ö and usually it works. ""The last knight"" is different from the beginning, it introduces way more story lines than it should, it tries to make a suspenseful plot with so many resources it just drags into a story that's full of holes and patches that it seems you're watching a lot of trailers from different movies with no connection between each other.The movie forces a lot of secondary roles (between the old and new characters) that it becomes boring and confusing at the same time. The main story becomes clear in the last quarter of the movie, just in time for the final battle¬Öby this point you're in fully overdrive mode trying to catch up with everything that's happened that it's barely enjoyable.Personally I think that the worst part is the lack of continuity, they jump from one scene to another in less than 30 seconds. This ""dynamicity"" makes it impossible to follow the main plot or even one story line. There are so many details and jumps between stories that it exhausting trying to connect the dots. I don't recommend it at all, not worth the money or time. Maybe if you're really curious or a big fan into the saga you may find it entertaining at some point, my only suggestion: lower your expectations, cause this is, by far, the worst Transformers movie.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Transformers: The Last Knight --- A True Disasterpiece,"The movie cuts and jumps so much and so quickly (Some scenes are literally less than 20 seconds long... in succession...) that by the end of the first half you'll feel dizzy from trying to follow.It takes everything from the other movies... and spits them out in raw, bloody bits which make no sense and flow like chunky soured milk.If Michael Bay has gotten tired of the franchise.... it finally shows. The last 45 minutes of battle were so bad... it didn't even redeem the movie.Trust me... don't bother going to see it in the theater, it's a waste of your time.299 out of 446 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,A movie out of even common sense,"The movie is made by a teenage writer who cannot even write conversations natural, read part of DaVinci Code, part of Arthur, and watched a Star War movie.

Oh, by the way, his knowledge about physics never go beyond what his parents told him in kindergarten.There are more than enough critics on plot and poorly told stories; I'm not going to repeat. But I have to point one character: the Old Man. Who cares what his name is (I didn't get it AT ALL) I don't know what kind of personality Michael Bay want to create. What I saw was a rude, uneducated, changing man with a lot of money. It was so awkward while he dump the famous names into my ears and declared that all those people tried to keep that stupid secret.

Transformers: The Last Knight,A steaming pile of disgustingly potent f*cking garbage.,"Transformers: The Last Knight may just be the worst movie I've seen in the last few years. While it may not objectively be a 1/10, my utter lack of enjoyment and the pain endured during the movie warrants the lowest of the low.It's been a month or so since I've seen it, and while I don't remember everything from it, there is one thing that I cannot ever forget that highlights its incompetence. Most movies have a particular aspect ratio, and if it changes, it is usually gradual, scene to scene. The Last Knight, however, cannot even keep its aspect ratio same in the same scene. Did they use different cameras for the same scene? Clearly, no even gave enough of a sh*t to fix it in post. It's disorientating, a lot like the movie's plot, dialogue and general terribleness. Maybe the different ratios are a metaphor.142 out of 264 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,A CinemaSins Gold Mine,"To be clear right out of the gate, I decided to see this movie with my brother solely because of how bad and laughable we both knew it would be. Boy was I ever right. Not only does this film plummet the Transformers franchise even lower than Age of Extinction, (which I truly never thought was possible), but Transformers: The Last Knight (TLK) showcases an absolute abomination of film making in general, creating what essentially is a $200 million pile of steaming hot trash, a horrible disgrace to the Transformers name and the film industry as a whole.It's a tad bit difficult to explain what the TLK is really about, because, well, I don't really know. I know that the Decepticons are looking for another ancient relic on Earth to somehow bring Cybertron back to life, but that's about it. The overall narrative is so clustered with noise (metaphorical and literal), random occurrences, numerous undeveloped sub plots, gaping plot holes, relentlessly forced humor, and atrocious pacing that for most of the film, I was literally laughing out loud in the theater and once shouted, ""what the Hell is going on!?"".TLK has the writing depth of an illiterate monkey, and the narrative focus of a child. Trying to understand TLK's story is like trying to listen to a baby complete their first sentence; it's confusing as can be, incoherent and probably pretty comical. I can't even speak positively about the Transformers themselves being cool because the Transformers are BARELY IN THE MOVIE. There is so little Transformer-on-Transformer action, I thought I had just watched a 2.5 hour trailer teasing the big action scenes to come, but all I got was more pointless, unexplained human-lead garbage who run the show in a Transformers movie. The script is a complete mess to put it kindly, a blubbering, babbling heap of uncoordinated crap, and I can't believe it's actually more disjointed than Age of Extinction. TLK goes below the bottom of the barrel, and it's script should be put on trial.At this point in the dumpster fire that is the Transformers franchise, I feel bad for any poor actor that gets sucked into these films. Mark Wahlberg, a fan favorite of mine, has sunk to an all- time low with his performance as Cade Yeager. Sure the writing of the character, and every character mind you, was sincerely abysmal, but even still, there's no heart, no motive, no passion whatsoever to deliver even an OK performance. Wahlberg was unbearable. Even worse was Anthony Hopkins, whose character was written so poorly I thought it was actually a cruel joke on Hopkins. To see a legendary actor fall to the abyss is terrible, and TLK as brought him, along with any other victims of this plague of a film, to the lowest of the low. Stanley Tucci literally plays a different character than in the previous film and it's just oh so bad, not to mention Josh Duhamel got dragged back into this awfulness again, with his character being just completely and utterly useless. The performance, writing and development of every character was horrendously awful, period.As Transformers films have gotten worse over the years, the only piece of the movies I have been able to write positively about are the big-budget action scenes, which at the least, provided some entertainment outside of the unintentional entertainment delivered by the terribleness of the films. However, I can't even write home about the action in The Last Knight. Sure the CGI still looks great, but good grief, the action is limited (when it comes to Transformers actually fighting), graceless and down right bizarre. I have to write about one moment in particular, however. Anthony Hopkins' character suddenly reveals at one point that his cane is actually a machine gun, and his cane-gun prevents Megatron from accomplishing his mission. I laughed out loud and choked on my drink, it was the selling point for me as one of the worst movies I've EVER seen.I could rant about how bad this movie is for a long time, but at this point, I just don't care anymore. I spent more time thinking about how CinemaSins will lay into the film than paying attention the main story. My hope is that I can prevent any soul from watching this deplorable display of film. Even if you want to watch for how bad it is like me, save yourself and don't. Transformers: The Last Knight is one of the worst films I've seen in my life, it's unfathomably shameful.1/10",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,Just reboot it already,"Beyond stupid story (despite some great ideas behind it), dumb script, plot holes bigger than Kanye West's ego, wasted acting talent and nonsensical directing.What did you expect? Whatever creativity Michael Bay seemed to had has been for years, perhaps even decades now.Besides Peter Cullen and Frank Welker's performances, the only redeeming factor is that this movie was not that big of a hit at the box office (just over 600 million instead of the usual 1 billion plus). This means that people have finally smartened up and realized that Bay and his crew will NEVER make a decent, let alone good or great Transformers film. Even the first one isn't much of a bragging right.Al I can say now is just Reboot it already. Give it to a director and writer(s) that has talent, skill and most importantly: CARES! Cares to make a faithful adaptation. The only three true prerequisites are Optimus Prime being pure red and blue and not flame covered and still voiced by Peter Cullen and Frank Welker as Megatron.The sky is the limit, the lore is surprisingly rich and full of detail.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Worst ... film .... ever,I wish I could give 0 stars to this movie. This is such a bad movie that it deserves a new category for itself.

Transformers: The Last Knight,"IMDb's star rating thing is broken on this movie, so I'm forced to write a review.","Maybe all the low ratings broke it?Hollywood should have stopped giving money to Michael Bay after Transformers 3. I paid $4 for my ticket and that included popcorn and a T-shirt. Even that was too much. This movie just dragged. Writing and pacing were terrible. The action scenes were cluttered. The dialogue bantering was REALLY bad and awkward; none of the character interactions felt like they could form cohesive sentences.You could tell Bay was like ""Hey this idea would look good. let's throw it in ..hmmm..... HERE."" ""Let's throw this other idea in ...let me see...... HERE"" .. ""AHA I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA!!!! let's put it here!!!!!!""Pretty soon, you have the most discombobulated movie you'll ever have seen.Try fitting... WW2 Nazis, knights, dinosaurs, Robocop ED-209's, car chases, submarine clashes, underwater space ships, air-to-air battles, dragons, love story, secret organizations, random Goonies kids, 20 new transformer characters, drone fights, magic wands, anti-gravity action, time-warping, alien-god with no backstory, cringeworthy sexual innuendos and racial stereotypes, and military Overwatch soldiers into a 2 hour movie that feels like it's 4 hours long.I dare you.

Transformers: The Last Knight,"Bad story, annoying char and unbelievable stupid human","Transformer movie have gone to the wrong direction They have a habbit make human bad person, make coalition with decepticon and killing autobot And this movie is the top of all, how can Lennox agree to ""use"" megatron, and he have already had experience in Transformers movie. Its really unbelievable, kill autobot and to make it even more laughable, Megatron ask the government to release bad decepticon , one of them kill many people on the bank robbery, and the decepticon is being hold in prison (yeah, can you believe it?) while on the previous transformer movie they killed every autobot in sight, including Rachet that join to save the earth on Transformer Movie. Then there is bald character, that suppose to be genius, give his idea....its really boring. I hope they reboot the movie and make it like the first one, the decepticon is so scary (in this movie, megatron is just a small puppet) and human and autobot is friend just like the cartoon",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,Awful & Awfully long Prolonging The Agony,"Best part of this film was when it was over. It looked as if the writer and director were trying to appeal to a younger audience while also attracting older siblings. Their attempt failed miserably. Reasons as to why this film is despised. Yes I said despised...well here it goes:1) Had a young teenage girl (14) in the film running around in a skimpy top showing much flesh - for her age (or any age). Not the best way to garner parental support. Put another way, good parents might have reservations about showing this type of soft kiddy porn to their children.2) At one point in the movie the geniuses who wrote and produced this American classic had a group of young teenagers break into a government restricted area making it seem fun and innocent. Then one of the young pubescent(s) makes a reference to steeling a vehicle within the confine hence stating ""lets hot-wire this b___h. Again, a good parent may have reservations, especially for a movie being marketed to a young audience. Dumb move by Mr Bay and the Hollywood moguls.3) Acting was terrible. Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Hopkins were horrible. Hard to understand what they were trying to accomplish? And if it were hard for me to follow then imagine the younger crowd. Silly story, bad acting and worse directing do not produce a good film.4) Script was annoying, bulky and full of rantings about some sort of wizard leading to magic via the creation of Transformers... blah, blah, blah... Another Harry Potter rip off. Sorry, don't want my children learning witchcraft. Another brilliant move by holly weird.5) Lots of mindless action. The movie producers could not let this film end within a reasonable time for some reason? Most films are an hour and 1/2 or so. Not this one, no sir, they prolonged the agony. Finally walked out. Could no longer endure the torture.Summary Marky Mark would of done better going back and doing ""New Kids On The Block"". Or as the (Funky Bunch). Send Hopkins back to England as retired! May God have mercy on their souls :(On a scale of 1 to 10 it gets a negative 1. If a worse score could be administered, it would hence take precedence.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,The Last Knight is the last draw for me as a long time fan of the Transformers.,"I went to a special screening last night for Transformers The Last Knight. Now I got a free poster for the movie but this is without a shadow of a doubt the worse movie I have seen all year.Now I am a huge fan of the Transformers since I was a kid but this movie is a disgrace to not only fans of The Transformers but for movies in general.It just goes to show why some people shouldn't give up their day jobs and everyone in the movie clearly did it just to get a paycheck if it was me I would donate the paycheck to charity so some good would come out of this abomination. The Story is such a mess that you would be at the point where you didn't care what is going on.The characters in the movie are so unlikable they are some of the worse I have ever seen in Transformers and in movies in general the movie just really show case why you shouldn't give a blockbuster like this to people who don't know what they are doing.The ""Acting"" and I use the term loosely is beyond awful and Terrible if there were another word for it I would use it. Again you can see the case was mostly trying to collect a pay check because they didn't care about Transformers or the fans they did whatever they wanted to so it feels like they were acting like selfish brats in the movie.The music is a bore and should have been given to someone who loves to tell a story with their music. The comedy is beyond bad it feels forced and don't make sense at all and don't serve any point to have in the movie. The only thing worth while is the effects because the Transformers designs.Transformers The Last Knight is without question of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. This movie is nothing but a slap in the face to every actor,actress and crew who take pride in their jobs and I won't buy the movie when it comes to DVD.I have seen a lot of bad movies but Transformers The Last Knight out does them all.I give Transformers The Last Knight an 1 out of 10",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,What is wrong with Michael Bay?,"Another terrible Transformers movie, complete with robots fighting and shooting at each other, nothing like the Transformers from the comics or cartoons, obligatory military advertisements showing the military taking down Transformers with ease in romanticized, stylized sequences complete just so the shoot can get the shots of military equipment it needs, all shot the same way military ads are, coincidentally. The Izabella character also bothered me a lot for some reason. I won't go into detail but if you watch the movie, you'll understand.

I couldn't figure out who's fighting whom and why are they fighting each other for the most part. Since nothing makes sense in this movie, when you're supposed to be excited or get goosebumps you are being told to be so by a character. I found this to be tame.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Poor filmmaking,I am not sure how it is possible that a movie like this get's green lit. This is by far the worst of the Transformers movies. I wouldn't even call it a movie because watching this it feels like dozens of trailers cut together. The previous films hat simple plots. I mean it is a blockbuster-popcorn flick so that is to be expected.But this time you need to find a plot in this mess. The story is told and edited so poorly that you never have a clear understanding of what is that needs to be accomplished. Why Anthony Hopkins singed up for that is beyond me. Nobody could make this script and these dialogues work. And because every Transformers movie needs to be 150 minutes it was by far the most painful movie experience in 2017!2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

Transformers: The Last Knight,Bay Outdoes Himself,"Well, if you thought that the previous 'Transformers' movies directed by Michael Bay were bad (or just plain average) - or almost any movie by Mister Bay for that matter - then you haven't seen anything yet. In a career of bad movie making, frequently going bad to worse as the years elapse, 'The Last Knight' could be described as Michael Bay's piece Dr resistance. It's a if his entire career of rotten cinema has finally culminated in this utter mess. Yet, if his track record is anything to go by,then there are no depths to how bad or low he can make movies, no end to it - 'Transformers' or otherwise. Somebody needs to stop him. And by somebody, I mean you, everybody. Please stop going to see Bay movies.

Starting from the beginning, the movie is relatively easy to track, and then it all becomes chaos until about the last 5 minutes, where you finally somewhat understand the main idea.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Did We Seriously Not Learn Anything?,"It is part war movie, part historical epic, part romantic comedy, part slapstick comedy, part disaster movie, and one-hundred-percent disaster. Honestly, were we expecting anything else to criticize about Transformers: The Last Knight? Well, a lot more can be said.The film opens 1,600 years ago in the dark ages of England, where King Arthur fights in a war along with his fellow knights, using fire cannons. No explanation comes up as to what started the battle, just what ended it. Basically, the wizard Merlin seeks out a spaceship to request help from the autobots. Yes, you read that right. Cybertron, along with a three-headed metal dragon, helped the knights of the round table triumph. I fail to understand why all these big movies suddenly decided to dump all over the Arthurian legend, but unlike the barely better King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, the disrespect goes further by victimizing London's ancestry.Yeah, I know, we have to suspend our disbelief with anything big released during the Summer, but there must be limitations. Anthony Hopkins' narration wants us to believe Stonehenge's original purpose was to be a portal, for crying out loud!The early trailers wanted to press the popular ""girl power"" mentality, when, in actuality, The Last Knight, like the previous four installments, cares only about making girls look acceptable for a thirteen-year-old's Sports Illustrated calendar. The series' new forgettable sexy young woman works at Oxford University, because only in the Bay-Universe can combined beauty and brains still come off as dumb. Even the fifteen-year-old actress here has to run in a loose bra and low-cut white tank top. The men do not get much better treatment either, as Mark Wahlberg awkwardly poses shirtless, six-pack in all its glory, for no apparent reason.The mercilessly long runtime continues Bay's plague of insulting woman as well as anybody of color. The one Black guy, played by the only actor in the entire film who seems to be trying, reflects the old caricature almost to a tee; one of the returning Japanese warrior autobots continues mocking every Asian viewer; French accents are mocked for sounding unnatural; then Native Americans take the hardest beating as the sole red-skinned individual gets comically nicknamed ""Chief."" Meanwhile, the true heroes in the spotlight gleam in pure red, white, and blue with the stripes and the stars.These shallow indistinguishable characters sway the balance scale with enough frustration to make you hate the human race. The worst new addition, an Irish butler autobot; resembles C-3P0 with a mannerism reflecting the Annoying Orange, and receives way too much screen time. None of the other characters, old or new, goes through any sort of inner change from the war besides the underused Optimus Prime.None of these lousy walking cardboard figures appeared serious about acting as a career‚Äîthey just wanted to star in a major production guaranteed to make 2.1 billion dollars worldwide. Though the blame for their performance lands more on the purely expositional dialogue constantly interrupted by long, boring jokes. It almost seems like the team of six editors resorted to a rushed first draft of their process.Each big action scene these editors had to work their way around felt like a climactic battle, which in turn made the final scene look pretty dang close to the infamous ""light beam from the sky"" climax. While the perfectly timed music and sound effects allow the right cinematic submersion you hoped for, Michael Bay forgets about all the Arthurian Legend fanfiction to give the visual effects crew a chance to show off (badly).All this roleplaying subliminally wants regular people to think they are more qualified to save the world than the pentagon, yet the ""regular people"" here show fewer signs of human life than the high-tech artificial intelligence. How can we resonate with an extraterrestrial robot which can turn into a car owned by a billionaire? They seem less like complex souls with fears and dreams, and more like subliminal messaging to hate the government while living dependent on expensive materialistic needs to sustain our humanity.Also, as a side note: When I went to purchase my ticket (on a Tuesday by the way) forty minutes beforehand, the house was already nearly sold out. So, we now know how our condition remains unchanged from sixty years ago: The United States is still holding itself back from the rest of the world.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Fool me once; shame on me. Fool me twice; shame on you, Fool me thrice; this is getting old Bay. Fool me FOUR TIME; AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","* Please note I'm not rating this movie a 1/10 purely out of spite or to be a troll, I sincerely believe this movie is utter trash and shouldn't be seen by anyone.'TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT' was directed by Michael Bay and stars Mark Walhberg, Laura Hadock and Anthony Hopkins. ‚ÄãHumans are at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving the future lies buried in the secrets of the past and the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Now, it's up to the unlikely alliance of inventor Cade Yeager, Bumblebee, an English lord and an Oxford professor to save the world.(Just so you know, I had to google the plot of the movie because screw me if I could figure it out)It's really sad that, completely accidentally, the last film I watched before this was 'The Rock'. That movie was Bay's last great movie and probably one of the better action movies of the 90s. That is all thanks to the stellar acting, characters and DIRECTION. Bay can direct good movies so it baffles me how he's gone down this rabbit hole of explosion porn and creepy, perverted female sex objects. I don't believe a director is completely lost and I never will; the old Bay is in there somewhere and he will resurface. But today is not that day. The Last Knight is an abomination on all counts, and I don't say that lightly. In every movie I review, I try to find a flaw in a masterpiece and a strength in gutter trash just to show nothing is flawless or completely lost but I genuinely struggle to do so with this movie. Perhaps the visual effects were nice to look at but that isn't really a strength when they've been done infinitely better. I wont ramble on much longer and will try to focus on some aspects of the film.Let's discuss the story for starters(if there even is one). I had to google the story for this movie because I couldn't understand it. No that is not me being stupid either, everyone I watched this with didn't understand it. I didn't miss a single thing and gave it my full attention at all point but I just couldn't get the film. If it's fan service, fine. But I still expect for people like me to understand the plot. Top that fact of with the fact that there is more exposition in this movie than there are minutes of screen time and you have a nonsensical script that was clearly finished in a weekend by... idiots. Don't want to sound overly harsh but if you think the story for this movie passes as quality entertainment, you need to watch A LOT more films.Enough of the story, how about the acting. Well, Mark 'What? No!' Walhberg was very poor in this movie but I don't blame him. It's mainly down to the script and I think he could tell the movie was gonna fail so he didn't even bother. Laura Hadock was pretty weak as Vivian and I don't understand her purpose to the story. She's there but makes no logical sense. She had no arc and her undying love for Marky Mark(that's not a spoiler; if you didn't think that'd happen by the time you first lay eyes on her you don't watch enough movies) makes no sense. How did Hannibal Lecter, one of the greatest villains and performances of all time, get dragged down to this level. I'm sorry Anthony but you don't need the money thus this is inexcusable. None of the characters, old or new, are likable. And who in God's name is Lennox? Was he a character in the other movies? Is he THAT forgettable?Aside from the semi-competent visuals, this movie is also technically flawed. The editing is abysmal and the cinematography as a whole is very weak. Set and costume design is irrelevant.The action is horrendous, the comedy is abysmal, the visuals just barely squeak by. I only saw this movie because it was free and I do not wish that burden upon anyone else. Please, let this movie die. It doesn't deserve the billion it'll probably make. I'll begrudgingly rate it 1 'DRAMATIC MUSICs' out of 10, and that is only because I don't deal with half values.",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,How long can a movie be?

Some people who wanted little public attention walked holding hands after 10 minutes into the movie.

Transformers: The Last Knight,And I Thought The Mummy Was Bad...,"I will keep this one as short as I can. I was conflicted on even putting this review up but I figured I endured the brutal two plus hour running time so I figured I'd vent very briefly about this film. This is not even a movie. This is a CGI spectacle of epic proportions that succeeds as a mindless, action driven cartoon show made for a crowd of toddlers. I contemplated walking out after the first ten minutes in which a voice-over so horribly and distressingly bad overtakes a story set up that can only honestly have been concocted by an eight year old and written in crayon. The cast is exceptional on paper but ends up hitting every dull note in the book. Even the most hardcore of Tramsformers fans will have to dig deep to enjoy this one. If this is any indication of what passes for a summer blockbuster then I think the 2017 summer season is in big trouble.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Good Story Disguised as Crap,"Somewhere in this movie is a good story. But thanks to awful direction, that good story is buried in a jumbled, un-entertaining mess.For the most part, nobody speaks in this movie. They banter. They deliver rapid fire one liners, quips, rather than lines. Crescendo becomes meaningless if everything is a crescendo. Quips, one liners, funny moments become cumbersome when every moment is filled with ironu and poor attempts at humor.There's a young girl character called something with a z. I can't remember the name. But the actress is awful. She doesn't speak her banter, she poses it. Even when she stands still, she does it in a deliberate way. Everything from her is forced, unnatural.There are flashbacks and even flashbacks within flashbacks, so it's hard to keep track of an ongoing story. Bay, as usual, makes use of too much slow motion. In one scene, one of the Transformers fires a time slowing weapon. But the effect is lost because it blends into all the other slow motion action. Some people caught in the weapon's range are moving slowly, but everyone moves slowly when there's action. So, um, what's happening?A lot of the effects look like something out of a theme park attraction. There are lots of explosions, bullets ricocheting, and sparks, but nothing seems close to the people who are the targets of the massive fire power. Once in awhile the action goes to super slow motion (that's why the slo mo weapon is confusing) as something barely misses a ducking and dodging human who shouldn't be capable of moving fast enough to get out of the way.Transformers roll around, losing pieces of their bodies. The action is shown with an always moving camera, with time jumps, and zoomed in to the point it's impossible to tell how the fight is progressing. Are all those pieces flying off a giant robot important? Is the robot winning or losing the fight? Did that part fly off before now, or is now a flashback, or is it a time jump? Is a robot hurt? Who knows?Speaking of time jumps, Bay loves to approach a scene then jump past the beginning, into the middle of the action. Someone is walking out of a building, a car approaches, then suddenly the person is inside the car in the middle of a chase scene. There's a lack of continuity. It's hard for a viewer to get his bearings, and thus it's hard to enjoy the scene. WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!!???? It doesn't help that the minds behind this movie pasted Transformers on top of King Arthur.The whole movie feels rushed, or feels like it has too much cut out of it.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Transformers has hit rock bottom.,I have just seen the new Transfomers and the only word that comes to mind is SHOCKING. I'm not going to repeat everything that people have already wrote but it's all true. I went in with an open mind and can honestly say after ten minutes was Thinking what am I watching... and did actually contemplate leaving half way through. they have completely ran out of ideas. save your money and wait to watch it for free. In my opinion they should have left transformers as a trilogy.If they do decide to make another one I hope to god the bring back Shia don't care how they do it because transformers died when he left4 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

Transformers: The Last Knight,Totally not worth your money,"I wonder how could the film makers sat down, watched this movie, smiled, and patted others' backs, saying, ""We have done a good job.""Give me a break, men!The plot is a tangled mess. The reason for these alien robots coming to earth is inconsistent between each Transformers movies.The chemistry between the characters is laughable and too forced. The way way they tried to match the professor, a super smart and loaded main girl with our dirt poor and jobless protagonist made me facepalm. Oh, he's a fugitive too, mind you. It's just too unbelievable. No sane girl would fall for this guy the way she is.It has never made any sense too why the humans treated the autobots awfully, even though they should have known already that they definitely need their help to protect earth. Unless the majority of humans in this movie are simply too foolish.Animation wise, it was very disappointing too. Early movies allow us to see cool transformation of humanoid robots to expensive cars / tanks / jet fighters / etc; but this movie don't have these. The transformations are hardly shown in detail. It's just Bang, Bang, Boom, Boom, Kyaaa; lots of noise and explosions with no value. Nobody died too in the midst of all that mess. Can you believe it?Don't waste your money on this movie.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,This is the problem with franchises!,"They are made to make money, and sometimes made at minimal cost for maximum reward, or at great expense for ridiculous reward. The problem with that is the whole point of making the film is lost...The script, the scenes, the choreography, everything!And that's whats wrong with this, so much effort has been made to make as much money as possible, that everything else went by the wayside. The script is appalling, to the point of embarrassing...I can see why, they thought hmm...Game of Thrones is successful, lets capitalise on that...FAIL! If you were a scriptwriter on this movie you should be ashamed and appalled, because you clearly turned up drunk on your first day and couldn't be bothered! The choreography - what is with the jittery screens, is it supposed to cause nausea, because that's all that ever comes from jittery screens, and why? The transformers transform, that creates enough jitter, why add more?! FAIL! And lets look at the screens....Errr 1600 years ago, a drunk Merlin that finds a not so well hidden massive space ship, gets given a mast after very little explanation, then proceeds to destroy enemies thus changing history irrevocably, hmmm, I am happy to suspend belief, but please, is this really happening? Oh and thats the first 10 mins!This film is an embarrassment for those associated with it and puts those people in a very different light in my opinion, as I don't believe they read the script and thought wow, what a great movie, and think it was more, wow, what a payday! Mark Whalberg, Anthony Hopkins, Josh Duhmal, I have a lot less respect for you now than I did before watching all 20 minutes I could stomach of this film!

Transformers: The Last Knight,Worst movie of the year is understatement,"Just released on netflix today so I gave it a go. After the previous two I hoped for a change in direction or something to return to the relative success of the first one. Sadly not!! This is the worst one yet! Rehashed nonsense plot and even reused lines and near identical optimus prime summary at end.
Michael Bay had earned a good name for himself with some great action movies, but now I think I will avoid his stuff forevermore. I mean seriously, did he run out of ideas a decade ago, did he read the script before embarking on this project or did he get alzheimers or something.
Wors editting ever, action scenes are confused and vague. Most of the acting is terrible, I feel for Anthony Hopkins a little as his lines and scenes were lame, he seemed to at least give it a go, but this was one to take a pass on.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Does Bay have a bet with somebody?,"I have to wonder at this point if Michael Bay is making these movies on a bet that he can turn out garbage that's progressively worse each time and still be profitable due to degenerate fanboy mentality and exceedingly low-taste foreign audiences more addicted to mindless action schlock than even Americans ever were.This is a gleaming golden special effects extravaganza doused in raw sewage writing. It's the most overt example of 'pornographied' action whoring I have ever witnessed, with nary a thought to plot construction, characterization, comedy, drama, continuity... or any other scripting skill for that matter.But what else can I say? I have to be honest, if I could put this little effort to a series and have a few hundred million morons keep making me richer because of their obsession with robots and explosions, I'd sell out quicker than Google acquiesced to China's censorship laws.Despite the rhetoric its frontmen spew, Hollywood is really about nothing more than profits. This movies series is but a metaphor for the film industry.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Transdumbers.,"If a work made human from the ape, ""transformers"" Michael Bay work exactly the opposite. You can check yourself by staging a marathon viewing of all parts at once. After the first film, you slightly will increase eyebrows. After the second will have a desire to run on all fours and comb out the cat. The third will reward you with a flaming red backside, and after the fourth you will find yourself hanging on the chandelier. Moreover, in the loop, although for monkeys, suicide is not typical.There is a fifth stage. Secret. To do this right after a marathon, you need to buy a ticket to ""the Last knight"" and somehow limped to the cinema. Advance say goodbye to relatives, because you will not return from the cinema. You Wake up on straw at the zoo, when inmates macaque will try to shove you in her mouth the banana. Well, or worse.Laura Haddock in ""the Last knight"" looks like a Megan Fox with an IQ greater than 70. So if a terrible Director as he is painted? Do not forget: the main scourge of all ""Transformers"" script. Eren Kruger, who would have to drive a dirty sponge right after ""Revenge of the fallen"" continued the paper to smear feces until the ""age of extinction"". Is it any wonder that time after time turned out trash? Probably not worth it. The paradox is that with the departure of Kruger, the situation has worsened tenfold. Not deteriorated, and it has worsened. Feel the difference? I wonder: what and how much they smoked and snorted to write the scene where Megatron comes to negotiations with lawyers, in order to get their accomplices out of jail? The rest of the writers are obviously afraid to break the formula of ""success"", and therefore stupidly copied the idea of ""Dark side of the moon"" falling on the Earth Cybertron and junk villain that duplicate the functions of Megatron. And the audience is drowned by the secondary and gave all his money, and even add a mandatory artifact, analogous to the ""Spark"" from the first film, the ""Matrix of leadership"" from the second ""Grain"" of the fourth. How fresh, how original! Shot to hell.The motivation of characters is really dumb, often with a fatal outcome. However, in the ""Last knight"" they are better than the fourth. Take, for example, the beautiful, aristocrat and Professor of the University of Oxford Vivien Wembley, which actually all is well. Except that Madame is clearly yearned for the staff of Merlin. When she is given the opportunity to engage in a risky venture for a couple with a muscular man, she does not doubt for a single minute. Sure...The hero of sir Anthony Hopkins is frighteningly stupid, even stupid agent Simmons guessed to take refuge in Cuba. It must be a lifetime to explore the secret history of the transformers, but to refuse to participate in the final opening, for safety reasons. And then to come to the showdown of giant robots and take a stroll in the center of the dough with a bored tourist. Not like the scenario is a miscalculation. It is planned, but empty dramatic reception.At least the empty was notorious transition of Optimus Prime to the dark side. The story-line with the brainwashing and sudden revaluation of values is a cheap lure, buy that only the Optimus Prime ‚Äî the moron put him out. That there sir Burton said about senile dementia of the transformers? Humorous component is much better since ""Age of extinction"", and the jokes sometimes work spontaneously: ""Only Merlin could use magic staff. Merlin and little girls"". No, the humor has not become less flat, but he served mostly in dialogues, which is good. The brightest of all the annealed robot Butler Kogman ‚Äî magically weird creature, being the fruit of forbidden love C-3PO from ""Star wars"" and Bender from ""Futurama"". The scene when the mechanical sociopath plays the organ very epic accompaniment to the monologue of sir Burton (well, Bey is not alien to irony!), truly good. About the beating salmon feet and say nothing ‚Äî it's so wild that even well. It is a pity that the screen time of Kagman not as much as I would like.""The last knight"" is not the stupid movie. It is degenerative. At the end of his tyrannical rule Bay was not the biggest problem, because he is simply not able to sniff so much coke to digest deadly conspiracy scenario game with dragons and Nazis and put her in even more monstrous form.Oddly enough, the fifth part is still better than the fourth: there are better characters, a more collapsible (though fiercely chopped in the editing) narrative, and the humour is better. On the other hand, action was noticeably poorer, and for ""Transformers"" is critical. The picture is still deep and large, but the effect of the doomsday as it is not felt. But ""Last knight"" in short, ""Age of extinction"" on as many as fifteen minutes! And it is the most generous gift that Bay could make the audience goodbye.",1

Smaller dinobots were in here and no explanation on where they came from or what they could do. Annoying little girl was awful to listen too.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Painful to watch,"Got bored last night and decided to watch this film on Now TV, completely regret it. The film is actually painful to watch. This can be attributed to a few things: the story that is so bad it reminds me of one I wrote at the age of 10, the constantly shifting aspect ratio of the film (something that actually gave me nausea) and the great injustice given to what were some of my favourite characters from the show. One again this film falls fowl of Bay's rapid cut editing, something seen in fight scenes in most films, that he seems to like to use on shots of empty rooms, it also doesn't help that in order to make the film more action packed and jerky he used his usual technique of removing frames every so often, which almost entirely defeats the purpose of the high resolution and playback ratio.
Overall this film managed to give me not only a headache but actually managed to make me feel ill and is a great injustice to the original characters be they Transormers or even Arthurian legend.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,A pileup of noise and blabbering,"Never expected it to be so bad. The dialogs are limited in a few words and phrases which indicate no plot at all no story but the usual excuses. Things go down and around so fast because there are no actual points to consider. Noise is top again maybe a bit less this time. The pictures are clearer so the spectator can figure out who is who what is what etc. though it is not a motion picture in the end rather than a long collage of montaged clips. 
I did not enjoy at all. The numbers justify them on the other hand. The gross seems to be more than double the budget. Strange. Good for the people who worked for that movie. 
Always good Mark does his part. Hopkins is perfect even in this mess of a movie. 
The tech stuff are superb but can't concern me much when I watch a movie. Who likes them will have lots of good fun.

This new Transformers movie, just make me stop watching this series. Its the first time i switched off a transformers movie. Acting is bad, jokes are bad, story is very very bad. I think Michael bay targeted this movie for young children/teenagers, because the story is so cheesy, like he didn't had time to create a story, but just made something up while shooting this film.Megatron died like 3 times in the series, and now is back again without any story behind it.

Even worse the entire film made no sense and why Anthony Hopkins signed up for this bull crap i don't know. This film basically made no sense, had major plot holes and the actions scenes didn't make up for this failure of a movie. I even think that this film was worse than Birdemic when i come to think about it, and trust me that was a bad film. I would recommend that you don't waste your money on this piece of SH*T. I did and i'll regret it for the rest of my life.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Going to the bathroom where they shouldn't,"Michael Bay went to the bathroom in his pants, therefore I came on IMDb to share my ambiguous ideas with everyone, in a facetious fashion. I can't write for crap so I came on IMDb to pretend I am a critic, I add a few words that make me seem more intelligent then I am, and I hit that magic preview button!! A large portion of my life is spent doing this. Thank you for reading!Cordially: Someone who failed writing class and came on IMDb in hopes that my review would somehow give me gratification.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Worst movie EVER!!!,"I would like to give you the true concept and update of the reviews of this movie.Like almost all reviews that were written by sane people down here, this is by far one of the worst movies ever made!!! The other few reviews that say how awesome this movie was, were probably written by the producers or the cast themselves... LAME! There are so many mistakes and so many fast scenes that you can't catch up with. The entire movie looks like it was made by an amateur, except for the end...In other words, DON'T EVEN BOTHER WATCHING IT!1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Shame this can't transform into something good,"It's god awful!We watched this.....well when I say ""watched"" it was more like struggled through this mire of crap, because it was so awful the aspect of ""watching"" doesn't apply.There's no story to speak of, I had no idea what was supposed to be going on except it was jumping from one idiot scene to another. The dialogue again was none existent and just one long wall of unpunctuated text that was delivered by flat acting.And then, the icing on the cake was the music, sad music out of nowhere? in a scene that didn't look like a sad scene? Action music in none action scenes!? What the hell? Did Bay rummage in the editors bin and splice this rubbish together from a mix of leftovers?Avoid this one, I really, really, REALLLLLLLY mean that!! It's that bad, not even slightly redeemable. Ugh.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Feels like they're not even trying anymore,"Yeah, wow... Never have I have seen so little happen in so much time.

And it would also be nice if actors would 'respond' to the cg stuff happening around them. Mark; that was a 15 feet sword coming at your face and barely missing you, and you didn't even flinch.

Transformers: The Last Knight,A sin for Cinematography,"I just can't believe,that people who did these movies are trusted with hundreds of millions.

Transformers: The Last Knight,World ending drivel,"I once saw a video of a two men in Canada, in a small boat, speed over to a baby seal and club it to death. After watching the latest 'Transformers' I wish that baby seal was me.There is conjecture that staring at an eclipse can blind you, and it saddens me to think of all the wasted opportunities I've missed to do so, which would of saved me from seeing the shite that Michael Bay peddles out to people.This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, further degenerating into an unforgivable sin by the butchery performed on a childhood legend.If I had a time machine that had but one charge, I would not use it to go back and stop Hitler dear reader. Oh no. I would stop someone far worse. I would go back and prevent Michael Bays' father from ever spawning Satan.I wont even rate it a 0 out of 10 because that would be too generous.",1

The Cheeze in this movie was soo over the top.At least in the movie Wonder Woman I could suspend disbelief, because the movie was Great and the acting was very good as well as the writing, also because I'm fond of Gal Gadot.Seriously tho, don't waste your time or money, don't even wait for it to come out on DVD or Netflix, in fact don't even bother streaming it on your favorite Pirate site...You have been warned.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,I was to my own surprise... disappointed (And my expectations were pretty low),"Spoiler Free I will start with the things i likes about the movie: 1. You can really see that sir Anthony Hopkins are having a lot of fun playing hos role. 2. The return of some of the characters from the original trilogy. I liked how the return of Colonel Lennox, for an example, bring a sense of continuity to the universe. I think continuity is one of the big problems of this franchise so it was nice to see Michael Bay try to fix that.The Things i did NOT like: pretty much everything else. I will just talk about the things i disliked the most: 1. As always the screenwriter of theme movies like to introduce just about 3.500 subplots even before the 30 minutes mark. This make for a very messy start to the movie and this also makes this movie the most incomprehensible in the entire series. Just after the movie had finished i was not sure what this movie was about. 2. The annoying characters that apparently has to be in these movies. These characters are Mark Walbergs new friend at the junkyard, and the science guy speaking about physics and math. Viviane's mother and her friends. Every time these characters were on screen i rolled my eyes so hard. 3. The complete lack of both plot development and character development. This is just such an important of crafting an engaging story but it's just completely ignored by the screenwriter.To sum op my thoughts, i did not expect a great film by any means. These movies have always been movies i saw whenever i wanted to turn my brain off, but now it's enough. This was also the most boring of the Transformers movies. The finale was terrible in every way possible. I just can't imagine myself watching this mess ever again. If you really liked the previous films then you are probably going to like this one to. It just wasn't for me. 1/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,My very low expectations have been underwhelmed!,"The pros: I liked the music. Good CGI.The cons: The story of the movie is a total mess. It's really the most confusing of all five. I see all this action and ask myself ""What the f**k is happening and why?"". Most characters are annoying and silly (I call them ""Jar Jar Binks characters""). Is it so hard to write a good story, especially when it has been done before in the animated series??? Enough of farting robots and all this silly nonsense, just watch the awesome 80s Transformers series and Transformers Armada to see how much potential is has! Not only the Transformers potential is wasted here, but also the potential of the actors like the great Anthony Hopkins who does the best with what is given to him.Conclusion: The best and only good Transformers movie still is the animated ""Transformers: The Movie (1986)"".2 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,It was so bad I had to leave a warning......,"....in the hopes that others don't suffer this movie. Any semblance of hope I had that Tranformers wouldn't be butchered further by this hack were dashed against the rocks again. Shame on me for having hope.I hope the actors, directors, and writers watch this movie and hate themselves for this disgusting cash-in. I hate myself for just paying them for this horrendous product of cinema because now they think audiences want more of this stinking feces.The story was rushed and all over the place is putting it nicely. The characters might as well have died for all I cared (and at times I hoped they did). The transformers had great graphics, but that's all they had. Only an under-developed mind like a young child could see this movie as anything other than just terrible.And leave it to Hollywood to make intelligent characters look like fools, poking fun at physics and inventors, but foreign academic liberal arts Doctor polo players in high society are so much more superior Mary Sues according to Michael Bay and his team of sell-outs.The only circumstances to watch this movie are if you're a masochist, you can see it for free, or you're being held hostage and they demand you watch ""Transformers: The Last Turd"" or face immediate execution.

Here's my thinking...if you are these guys you have enough $/balls/street cred to only take on movies that you think will be good...you can pass on the dogs and there is no way that this script (when read by any semi-literate human) could have come across as anything but a dog. It made no sense, had no plot and GOD the dialog! I am so tired of these movies casting the ""black guy"" as some idiot who's sole reason for existence is comic relief (I mean I get why they do it, but the attempts at humor are so bad that they border on gibberish).

No character-building, no logic to the story, no buildup and let a lone some originality. Reboot this hole thing. Or better yet, let someone make a REAL transformers movie but don t call it transformers so you are free of the bullshit Hasbro wants you to do. If you do this: Use lasers instead of guns and follow the true Original G1 story line. Make it darker. Transformers is a battle for energon fought with laser's for god sake (and occasionally a energon blade in close combat). Hell, from the very beginning of the movie, it is clear that the makers are not serious about this film themselves. It is so so bad! which is just stupid because a Transformers movie could be the UGE! Put more effort in a good story line and character build up. Make it darker and more intense in dialogue and intrigue. Only use Bay if you need to get the action-scenes theatreproof, but I could live without if the atmosphere is good through good story, dialogue and screenplay. Make it more grown up. Or make it a silly animation movie that can be shown to 5 year old. But please don't try to do both. I hate the franchise now. Was a fan of the first and the second movie.

Transformers: The Last Knight,Glad this is Bay's Last,"Yes, if this is Michael Bay's last Transformers film to direct or have any sort of involvement with I will be happy. Now maybe we can get a director who actually cares about the source material. This film reflects on what Bay is about, good effects, but a flat script, characters that are pointless, and awkward humor. This is the 5th film and you'd think by now it would've improved. Nope, its just as bad if not worse then the last. At least those were somewhat entertaining, this is just flat-out boring. Nothing of interest happens, and the running time is just unnecessary. The only areas I liked in the film was the opening scene. An epic battle of warriors and a three-headed dragon. It proved that Bay can direct action and epic quality. But afterwards, it takes a steep downward spiral into oblivion. Not even Anthony Hopkins can save this mess. A disappointing film indeed and a weak conclusion to a franchise that had such high hopes in the beginning.

Transformers: The Last Knight,"If I could rate it zero, I would.","How this film isn't being considered one of the worst ever made is beyond me. After having the extreme displeasure of viewing it, I sat back and contemplated just how much a person must fail as a filmmaker to mess up seemingly every part about making a film. It's a rare thing these days. To find a film where by the end of it, the only positive you can find is that it had one or two cool shots.I was stunned to realize upon watching the film, that the frame ratio changes almost every other shot, from IMAX to Standard. Not only does the frame ratio change, but the quality of the image changes, with IMAX being a cleaner image, and Standard being about as appealing as a cockroach in your bed once we've already been shown the IMAX quality.Not only does the constant change in quality and frame affect the enjoyment and understanding of the film, but the characters are so incredibly poorly written and acted, that it adds a distinct and potent level of cringe to the film's already almost unbearable runtime.The comedy is forced and bland, with jokes running on too long in a vain attempt to make the audience laugh. Honestly, it would have been funnier if Michael Bay had come on the screen halfway through the film, and told us just how stupid we are for giving him money. That would have been funny. But no, let's listen to acclaimed actor Sir Anthony Hopkins say, ""Dude"", and ""Bro"", twenty more times. Just astoundingly terrible.To try and explain the plot would be like trying to explain the concept of a consistent tone to the writers of this film. By the end of the film, I still had no idea what was going on. That's not the calling card of a worthwhile film.The whole film is like an assault of the senses. With the frame ratio and quality changing every five seconds, the continuity of the film being shamefully ignored, the lack of any interesting characters and then shoving us with forced exposition and ""emotional"" scenes. The tone never finds its footing, and jumps from dead serious to everyone trying to be a comedian in a second. Not to mention that the cinematography is so lazily done, that characters magically teleport to different locations because I suppose filming shots where people are leaving rooms is too boring for Michael Bay. The special effects haven't improved since the first one, and when I say that the humor will make you want to break your TV with a hammer, I mean that from the deepest depths of my soul. The humor should come with a warning. It's so cringey, that it could kill someone.But hey, if your a regular Transformers watcher, this stuff isn't new to you. Because why watch something good, with a message and a point for existing, when you could watch Optimus Prime say his own name twenty seven times, and have Mark Whalberg have a bloated and unessecary talk about ""chastity"" with Sir Anthony Hopkins. (Seeing Sir Anthony Hopkins in a Transformers film is another thing I'll put on my list for why humanity doesn't need to exist anymore).If you want robots saying horrible one liners, watch cliche backup characters and uninteresting main characters, and overall, if you would like to be given complete garbage to pay for, because Michael Bay knows you'll spend the money on it, then have a fun time with this film. There's plenty of robots hitting each other. But a part of us should be sad that filmmakers are allowed to be this knowingly lazy and horrible with millions of dollars. A film with this much money should not have failed at the simplest steps of making a film. And these companies, knowing full well how disgustingly poor these films are, are shipping out the lowest quality of ""entertainment"", because they know that even if they replace all the characters with cardboard cutouts, people will go watch it. It's a blatant sign of disrespect, that no one is fighting against. Sooner or later, all big blockbusters will be this horrible, because we're allowing these companies to be rewarded for their childlike actions. So, don't be surprised if the next Transformers film is filmed on a camcorder, and has no editing at all. You ask for it by paying to see the film.Please...don't watch this movie. Ever.",1

Wish I had the 2.5 hours back. Having grown up watching the original cartoons I am supremely disappointed. I have seen some terrible movies in my 43 years, but this one takes the prize. The 1986 cartoon movie blows this one away.Seriously, I would watch re-runs of M*A*S*H and search for Rachel Madcow nudes for a year straight before watching this garbage again.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Michael Bay, if you'd spent the budget from this rubbish on feeding starving kids in some of the countries used as locations, the world may think better of you.

Transformers: The Last Knight,"Unwatchable!! I mean, what the hell??!!","The trailer to 'The Last Knight' looked really incredible. Having seen it, though, it really is a pity the film was not as good as the trailer. I'm not sure whether this was intended as an actual sequel, or a spoof? This is a COMPLETE mess!My gosh, I don't even know where to start with how bad this was. Maybe with how cringe worthy their attempts at humor was. This film is like a very, very bad comedy, and definitely more annoying than funny. Without all the unnecessary stupid scenes taking up screen time, the film could easily have been cut to about two hours, or less. What the hell were they thinking with all this silliness??? This is a dramatic action adventure fantasy series, so how did it become so slapstick??? It was beyond stupid and almost unwatchable. Yes, I used the forward button more than once, as I simply couldn't handle some of the stupid scenes!'The Last Knight' offers nothing in action we haven't seen in the previous four films. Even the visual effects were not the greatest. (Some were actually quite bad for such a big budget film and a series known for stunning visuals). The action scenes are so few and far between, I hesitate calling this an action film. Nothing about this disastrous, ridiculous entry in the series was even remotely interesting or exciting.The characters and dialogue were just as stupid as the humor. Laura Haddock portrays Vivien Wembley, who is a professor and becomes the film's hero, but she's as stupid and shallow as can be and her speech resembles nothing relating to a professor. Mark Wahlberg, who made a credible hero in 'Age of Extinction' is a silly, comical character, equally shallow.I hated this film so much, I think I'll conveniently forget I've ever seen this. I WANT to forget this. Please, no more!!! This hideous film proves 'The Transformers' have clearly overstayed their welcome. (and I read they actually planned another 12 films... Save me!!!).",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,insulting,"I'm a guy that adores transformers, I've watched all of the TV shows and movies, I own a large amount of the toys and adored the franchise since I was a baby. Age of Extinction wasn't as bad as people said it was (but it still wasn't great), it was good enough to leave me hyped for the sequel. I remember the day that the first 'last knight' trailer came out and I was at the edge of my seat; it wasn't long before it was released, i went to see it on the day of release, I came out of the cinema that day insulted and annoyed. This movie is a joke, it tries to be serious about its plot but it can't due to the awful acting and annoying characters (excluding non-human characters). The movie has no structure; everything just kind of happens but by bit with no explanation, this makes the movie twice as boring as it already was. People think a lot different to me but I personally think Shia Labeouf is miles better than Mark Wahlberg, Labeouf was slightly annoying at times but at least he had good lines and played his role as the crazy teenager sam very well, his character arc in 'dark of the moon' is great, showing an angel sam attempting to cope with normal life and displaying his characters emotions extremely well. Wahlberg on the other hand is obnoxious and boring, he's that typical dad characters we've got to know and hate over the years of cinema, he's the only lead character who always seems that he's not supposed to be there. There are some things I love about this movie, such as the stunning CGI and unique character designs (especially megatrons new design), most of the voice actors of the transformers do a great job, it was great seeing Peter Cullen and Frank Welker reprise their roles as Optimus prime and Megatron (who are still as good in role as they were in the 80's). Transformers: The last Knight is a hot pile of garbage and is a disgrace to those that loved what the first 3 transformers movies were all about, thank Primus Travis Knight rebooted the franchise with 'bumblebee' (which is a great movie and fantastic return to form). I genuinely HATE! this movie.",1

Transformers: The Last Knight,This movie makes sick,"The movie industry should establish a standard against health-damaging movies. I cant believe what kind of sick making digital rubbish is allowed to be released in public.90% of all scenes are shown no longer than 1 second. all other scenes are shown with always moving and shaking camera. This movie really makes watchers sea sick or you get banned unnoticed, growing epileptic subtle illness.This is a way of directors to blur their incompetence of creating good quality shots. Trying to gather viewers attention with cheap and poor tricks. Throwing a bunch of unstructured impressions without real content into a humans brain, is just exploiting natural behavior, the brain cannot resist and creating an illusion of attraction.No wonder many kids these days have ADHD. This movie is the top of cluttered ... something (cannot be called movie).I hope movie making becomes more reliable and sustainable again in the future!",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Objective review,"I was expecting it to be weak, but man this totally destroyed my will to live, I would rate it at -10 if I could.This is the first time I felt the need to write a review about a movie. I do not recommend anybody watching this, it shouldn't have more than one star, for the following reasons:1. Script: doesn't seem to exist, there are a lot of things that simply don't make sense, even after taking into account the sci-fi aspect. 2. Horrible camera action. 3. Scenes abruptly change, nothing connects, no transitions. 4. Disastrous acting. 5. Defies logic, in a bad way.Overall, surprisingly bad movie, even if you expect it to be bad.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Actually fell asleep,"It's kind of painful because the 4&5 movies are interesting conceptually. I dug the concepts like human made transformers, the transformers actually being a slave class and the idea that humans would obviously come to fear and outlaw them. That never seems to be the issue with transformer movies. It's always the pacing and dialog. I watch a lot of Korean and Asian cinema generally and the dialog whether it be subtitled or dubbed is always at least a little confusing. Thats one of the hallmarks of a good film. That the scenes can convey the message well enough that you can sort out the dialog. This movie is the opposite end of the spectrum. The pacing, establishing shots and dialog are so bad I was constantly confused about what was going on. Transformers from all over the galaxy are crash-landing on earth at a rate so high they have forces dedicating to killing them on impact rather than trying to sort out good guys and bad guys. Neat. Cade has creating a haven for good ones. Neat. They're hiding out from the government, Then it all falls apart. Megatron has hostages and trades them for the freedom over the lamest possible decepticons. the task force decides to let them know where cade is so that can trap the decepticons. So they know where Cade is, have been ignoring him, but instead of warning him they show up later? and ignore the decpticons and attack cade? what? They fight off the decepticons then the task force and anthony hopkins shows up something something england prophesy, oh also Optimus thinks the makers hurt cybertron even though he blew it up in the 3rd movie and there's this obnoxious British model whos supposed to be a professor but she sucks...look I know what you're thinking ""man this review is just meandering and rambling."". Actually I'm trying to give you a sense of the confusing nonsensical plot of this movie. Also I literally fell asleep during the england prophesy stuff. I will genuinely try and rewatch it, but I really gotta admit. This may actually be the worst Transformers movie. It's dull and difficult to watch.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Watch it, only if you enjoy CGI work","I have enjoyed the transformer series from the beginning and this is one of those movie I waited so eagerly to watch. But it was a disappointment. I don't know why but I felt the movie had nothing new to offer. Few things I thought were awful: 1. Same old way of directing, same camera shots, even though I enjoy these shots a lot, this time they seem very vague. I don't know if it was the director or cinematographer. 2. Bad story line, very depressing screenplay and most importantly terrible editing. 3. I need to emphasize on editing because it seemed like a patch work. 4. MOST IMPORTANTLY NOTHING NEW TO BE OFFERED BY THE MOVIE. If they had a movie formula (Big fights, slow motion shots, huge explosions, a lot of CGI work, more action, few emotional dialogues ) for international market, this movie fits in well.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

I wanted more of Optimus Prime but I saw more of a bloody teenage girl (Absolutely unnecessary) and bloody humans. Not a SINGLE real fight scene just human crap.

Transformers: The Last Knight,This movie was amazing - NOT,"First I have to admit that I have never written a review on IMDb. After seeing this awful vehicle last night, I felt compelled to write a short opinion.As a child from the 80s, it hurts to see the uninspirational new transformer-movies. Robotic dinosaurs and robotic knights, really? OMG.The story is quite absent so I can not really say much about that. After 2 and a half hours of CGI-stuff exploding and spectacle, you just don't care anymore and are frankly unimpressed.With a budget of 270 million dollar you can still make rubbish. How come other small budget movies succeed (and they use CGI as well)? How come transformers have human faces? It is really frustrating to look at, especially with all the CGI, you know that they could have change this.Michael Bay is able but maybe doesn't really want to make good movies? 13 Hours was nice but this have been a crime. I wonder how much they paid Mark or sir Anthony to be in this horrifying thing they call a movie. Or maybe they didn't see it. I hope so, for their conscience.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,Worst Transformers movie,"I am a transformers fan and it feels really painful after watching this movie. I guess human beings in the transformers world are the most dumbest ""Homo Sapiens"" of all the cinematic universe; I mean in almost all their movie they first try to eliminate transformers(or specifically our loved Autobots) but eventually Earth is saved by them (to be just destroyed in next movie), but what I really don't understand is that why they have trust issues with Autobots in the initial part when they are their only way to protect the Earth. That's just not justifiable. However, the story line is good but it is the editing and the way of presentation which causes the dent. I mean the movie is not properly presented to the viewers and its really hard to cope-up with the pace with which movie is going. This is the worst rating that I am giving to any movie; and it feels really bad when you have to give it to one of the best film franchise.0 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,As bad as the previous sequels,"Waited to watch this for free and let me tell you, I still feel ripped off. They spend $200m on this? Why?

Might as well pay $15 per head for Sharknado.Don't know where to begin. Disjointed scenes, childish plot, no character development, and baby bots? Are they serious? Optimus Prime is now Optimus Wuss. Bubble can talk... and oh, the transformers have been around for centuries and they are the ones driving human history... lets see... Merlin is a drunkard, Arthur is somehow a good guy compared to the people he is fighting because we all know that Britain is awesome. There is a Tomb Raider rip who is also the chosen one (obviously). I mean, this movie brings shame to our entire species. It was written by children for I don't know who. Even as I child I didn't like the cartoon story plots, but they had a reason for that. Namely, they didn't have $200m to spend on an entire season of cartoons never mind 4-5 episodes.Watch it if its free, if for no other reason than to verify just how terrible the writers and directors are.

Spider-Man: Far from Home,This film sets a new low standard for superhero movies,"I'm a fan of Marvel characters in general, and I like the MCU and X-Men cinematic storylines. I'm able to enjoy even the poorly-executed parts of both of them. But this is a far worse case.
Until now, most of DC films were the definitive low standard in superhero movies. Spider-Man: Far from Home has now taken this place.
I watched the whole film with a sense of disbelief to myself. I couldn't believe that the film was as bad as I was perceiving it. But then, it ended. And I realized that yes, it wasn't me. I didn't lose something. The film was abysmally bad. In every aspect.
The lack of scenario is striking. There's a constant flip between three different sets of characters, that have little to no connection to each other and one of them (Parker's classmates) exists for no reason whatsoever in the film. They are inconsequential. Instead of serving the purpose of a social background, this bunch of bad American comedy stereotypical ""characters"" are constantly thrown to the screen for no reason. This not an exaggeration. For no reason at all.
The rest of the storytelling is not as annoying but it's unbelievably flat. There's not a singe strong moment throughout the film.
There's no reason to comment on acting, simply because there isn't any.
The overall impression is that some very bored people were forced to execute the dull task of filling a production quota.
This review does not contain any spoilers, simply because it's impossible to make one.",1
Spider-Man: Far from Home,If there was a 0/10 this would be it,"Where do I start. The writers sure read the best seller ""how to destroy a franchise in one swift cringy blow""If you are looking for a original spiderman experience, back away now before it's too late.Attention spiderman is now for adolescent teens who have no grasp for real acting or storylines. First of all Spiderman could not come across as more of an sputtering, unconfident dweeb. But I guess that's what the millennials adore. Spiderman is no longer a nerd turned into a confident superhero, he is a character with no Brains or direction. At every point not thinking for himself and at every turn looking to chicken out. RIP spiderman.The casting crew in this movie should be run out of Hollywood for the terrible attempt at matching actors to these simpleton characters. Gyllenhaal must have roles few and far between to agree to this nonsensical garbage. He would be the last pick for this bady. Dont get me wrong hes a good actor just a horrific match to this character.The leading ""lady"" is not Hollywood material, shes straight from a homemade c grade movie. Ain't got the look, not the acting skill. Everytime she appears is a pointless and waste of film time.This movie has more plot holes than cheese, and plenty of extra cheese to add to your already stuffed stomach.Regardless of slowly dying whilst watching this movie I gave it a chance to the end saying to myself that somehow this would get miraculously better, alas I was wrong...it got worse. Totally destroying my love of spiderman.
I was left completely disappointed and gobsmacked after this movie and heartbroken that I will never get that 1 hour and 56 minutes of my life back.Watch it if you dare, but dont whinge about it after reading this review as my words ""i told you so"" will be echoing in your sore and brooding mind.",1

Spider-Man: Far from Home,Bland characters. Boring. Disappointing.,"Big budget movies like this one, insisting on stuffing politically correct garbage down your throat is just lame. I'm pretty sick of it and for that I award this movie with a solid 1 out of 10. Why not just go out and entertain your audience for once? Isn't movies made for the sole purpose of entertaining people?The characters had zero chemistry and I found them downright boring and uninteresting. The jokes where creepy at times and bearable at best.The story was very predictable and that is perhaps it's biggest weakness. A good story is gripping and you're always wondering what is about to happen next. All I was wondering about was when it will end so that I can leave and go on with my own life.The special effects were great. Interesting to look at and I'm sure they put in huge effort. It was quite entertaining to look at... But eye candy does zero to engage you like a good movie would.All in all a big disappointment. I was really hoping it would be a great movie and I had high hopes for it. The high rating it had made me look forward to seeing it but unfortunately there was no shortage of disappointment.It's great to go and see big budget special effect movies but not so great when the only thing that is interesting is the special effects. :(",1

Spider-Man: Far from Home,You're joking right?,"Right, this film sucks. I mean I don't just mean compared to literally any other Spider-Man adaptation but just on its own. Let's first of all forget how bad of an adaptation it is because I'm sick of hearing 'iTs An AdAPtaTIoN ITs MEanT tO bE DiFfeReNT'.
The acting is extremely poor
The plot lacks any feel of threat (but that is stereotypical marvel)
The script is poor as in the jokes don't land and the spilling of emotion doesn't seem to work
Look, if I ignore the fact that this isn't a Spider-Man film or even a marvel film but is instead someone trying to reclaim the magic of the old John Hughes movies (which they have stated that's what they're doing) I would still be disappointed. They use the wrong formula for the wrong type of movie and you get a film that really doesn't make any sense. I mean this film is based on that one time tony said peter was an avenger to make him happy.

Spider-Man: Far from Home,The amazing spider trash,This movie looks so corny and bad. Its 2019 and its the movie after Endgame and all we get is this really rotten product. MCU is so dumb. They can make gems but choose to make rotten trash like Spiderman movies.This movie is the definition of trash. There is no dept at all. This Spiderman is basically Kickass in a tech suit.Spiderman is suppose to be about his life. This movie was about a boy that needed to be snapped away again.You think after endgame and infinity war Peter would gain some experience from battling thanos and aliens. Nope. He is still a noob.This Spiderman is trash. Only plus is mysterio but like always villains get wasted because they are not loki or thanos.Kevin feige maybe the legs and brains of the mcu but he is bad at creating consistent long lasting villains.If Marvel can't protect their own Spider Man. Then X-Men and Fantastic 4 is doomed. No pun intended because MCU is about to make X-Men and F4 into rotten trash.,1
Spider-Man: Far from Home,"Painfully Bad, Not the Spiderman we all know and love.","This was the worst rendition of spiderman in the entire series, at least for me..It was painfully bad to sit through and I actually had to break it up into 2 nites of watching ,as it was just to hard to sit thru 2hrs of it all at once..To me, toby mcquire IS spiderman, that guy just nailed it and noone has done it as well since..Garfields spidey was also Very good but not as good as the original... Unfortunately, Hollands portrayal falls very flat..It lacks the character and is missing depth and dimension..Holland comes across as a whiny schoolkid who just happens to have superpowers ..Maryjane in these films played by the black chick is utterly and completely lacking in Any chemistry with Tom as spidey... zitlch, nada, nothing there at all..Previous films ,even those with Garfield had maryjanes who were Connecting with spidey and had an emotional bond.. its so lacking with the current ""politically correct"" casting that its nonexistant anymore..
Compare this fiasco with previous movies ..look at the relationships with maryjane, aunt may, uncle ben, Harry, ect and look at what its become now..Bickering schoolkids with no depth at all..As for the villian, Mysterio was just weak and the reliance on tech for illusion theme was a letdown for me...The effects dragged on and on and I hate to say I was bored senseless with todays special effects cgi, but in this instance, I truly was and did not find it enjoyable at all...Look at the incredible spiderman 2 movie with Doc Oct and tell me how this new spiderman is even worthy to bear the name? utterly silly outfits with insect arms coming out of it , Come on! the suit in the earlier movies was perfection and didnt need to be messed with...it was like seeing a cartoon come to real life.... Todays crazy techy suits look just ....ridiculous...If a movie Ever needed to be Rebooted, yet again, its this one...Erase it from memory and find an actor worthy and capable of the role..Get back to its roots and start again...Anything would be better than continuing this abomination in its current form...",1

Peter Parker and Aunt May and Mary Jane aren't who they are supposed to be and I don't care if this is an alternate universe.Even Mysterio is different including his back story. It doesn't work for me.Even the script is poorly written. The story didn't make sense. The characters were plastic. Traveling through Europe was filler.They threw out the spider sense because it would make their script not work. Also because it would prevent the holograms from functioning. Which by the way, holograms do not work like Professor X sneaking in to your mind making you think you are being punched.Overall this movie represents how corporations have taken over the creative process of making movies that need more artists.

Spider-Man: Far from Home,Cheap teenie comedy featuring Spiderman,"This movie is such a bad, typical contemporary Disney production, there are now words to express it. It's a movie for max. 10 years old who don't know about Spiderman or older ones with the taste and intellectual level of today's world population.
Watch ""10 things I hate about you"" and see a movie with the real intention of being a teenie comedy with so much more quality - again, there are neither words nor a measurement scale in existence to express that - while this piece of crap is a failed superhero movie with the stink of the Disney money making industry.
There's nothing more to say, every reference to scenes, actors or story in this movie failure would be pointless, cause there is actually nothing but cheap comedy mixed with CGI.

This rating is a disgrace and spitting in the face to all greatest movies in the past that became cult and reference. This movie is 'far from quality' and far from any respect to the viewer.
It is funny that some 'Paid to review' reviewers falsifyingly state that 'this is the best Marvel' movie. This industry became lowest of lowest and reviews can be true but in the same time can be gross raising (if you engage enough ghostwriters to pretend to be real viewers and reviewrs).

Spider-Man: Far from Home,Leaves a bad aftertaste,"This movie is really a 6, but all the (paid?) 10/10 reviews bring its score up artificially so I'm compensating for that.
Why in the world is Spiderman pictured as a mindless irresponsible moron in this movie? I thought he was supposed to be the hero, but apparently not. Also drones seem to be the do-it-all panacea here, which after a certain limit gets very hard to swallow and even ridiculous honestly.
Here's my wholehearted recommendation to all reviewers: wait until you see a movie at least for a second time before reviewing, you'll see it will either get better or worse after that, in the case of this one, much much worse.
A lot of the villain plans in this movie have an almost nonexistent probability of coming through, like they're really stupid and in my mind not even a 10 year old would come up with something so idiotic.

Spider-Man: Far from Home,Spiderman for the ADD generation.,"They say with age, hearing begins to decline - that you cannot hear certain frequencies, and that adolescents and young adults have far more acute hearing than, say, my generation (60'ish). This is true and succinctly defines whomever was behind the creation of this most recent reboot of the Spiderman franchise.The dialog and content of this and the prior Tom Holland Spiderman opus (Homecoming) are nothing more than a melange of... annoyingly banal rapport delivered with rapid-fire (ie, incomprehensible), breathless staccato that, alone, beats you senseless in the first 15 minutes of each movie. The cast is more or less a cadre of high strung, relatively clueless characters seemingly suffering from uncontrolled Attention Deficit Disorder and boundary issues. The ""adults"" are more or less just in the movie to provide character relief; equally as clueless to the surroundings and the wards under their watch.A most annoying movie in a most annoying franchise.

Spider-Man: Far from Home,Utter Garbage,"I watched this movie hoping it was an improvement on the last disaster of a spider movie, and I can say in all certainty that this is by far the worst of the whole spiderman movies.It's more of a coming of age, teenage crush movie, with some spiderman thrown in, what a waste of time and effort from the movie studio, bad predictable story, really not much thought has gone into it, seems that's what Hollywood is about now, pump out films with little or no thought with the same predictable characters and stories.Don't waste your time on this pointless movie.9 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Spider-Man: Far from Home,If it wasn't for the graphics I'd give it 1 star,The only good thing is the graphics which is expected from MCU movies. The story and the character of Spiderman is ruined by this debacle. Spiderman is basically a whiny teenager who whines his way throughout the movie and makes stupid teenage decisions. I can't believe how far the Spiderman franchise has fallen and the direction they've taken it. Thankfully it goes back to Sony and hopefully they don't continue with this teenage drama.9 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

Spider-Man: Far from Home,How could he be a superhero?,"Nothing to say about story, production, CGI and sounds. With the budget of a major production company, this is expected by default. I am definitely disappointed by the choice to put an insecure teenager, in the middle of an hormones storm given by puberty, to be a superhero. Perhaps they made this choice to capture teenagers attention and get them to the theaters, but it results in an idiot jumping around and get beaten by the bad guy all the time. He wins at the end because this is how it has to go, but i really doubt this could happen in practical. Too stupid to be a hero. Light years away from past productions where other actors and better scripts were able to make a teenager appears like a normal one.6 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Spider-Man: Far from Home,Worst one yet,"I miss the old animated series from '94 and the Raimi movies. They captured the perfect spider-man in my opinion. They were the perfect blend of dark, serious and with good comedic jokes. The villains had depth and none of them were bad for the sake of filling a role.I enjoyed them quite a lot as a child/teen and as I got older I now enjoy them for different reasons. They are very entertaining, which cannot be said with other works portraying spider-man, including this movie.I don't even know where to start... Who thought it would be a good idea to put Iron Man and spider-man in a blender and see what comes out? The jokes are horrible and repetitive. Counting how many times he took off the mask in public, you might think he was acting like a rock star and not as a vigilante protecting his secret identity in order to protect the lives of the people close to him.Plot holes a dime a dozen and the way everything was dumbed down to the point of being unwatchable. They say ""yeah but it's for kids so it must be like that""; but is that really true? I mean isn't the point of media/art to show kids interesting concepts so they can stimulate their growth and understanding of the world? Even if I had kids, I would not take them to something like this...",1

Spider-Man: Far from Home,Was this a joke?,"This isn't the Spider-man I know and love. This is little pip squeak iron man and his politically correct friends and classmates. Everyone knows who Spider-man is and his secret is hardly an important thing. Dear lord the blatant horrible acting and cringey dialogue...all that was missing was a laugh track. I've seen better Power Ranger episodes when I was a kid. This is clearly a Disney creation, they might as well have made it animated by Pixar.-No respect to Spider-Man and his fan base
-Everyone in this movie is too painfully ignorant, oblivious, and stupid (comically and cartoonishly) to know what's going on.
-Every character is miscast and nothing like they are suppose to be. Pick your own example...""MJ"", Aunt May, Flash, and so on...
-The dialogue and conversations are so cringe inducing that you might develop a migraine.
-The acting. I don't know a word fit enough to describe it. It's obvious it's acting. And it's a race to say the next one liner.
-This movie was purely made to make action figures and get more money in the pockets of Marvel and Disney. There's been better spider man cartoons.
-Disrespect to the villain Mysterio.And for God's sake, SPIDER-MAN ISNT IRON MAN OR NEEDS TO BE IRON MAN! Spider-Man never needed or should need to be under Iron man's shadow. So disgusting how they treat Spider-Man. He used to be top dog within the world of Marvel comicbook characters. He's a genius and doesn't need anyone's help, not Tony not happy not super smart edgy ""MJ"" not Ned not anyone. He can make his own costume and his own webbing. Spider-Man/Peter's only figure he wants to be like is his uncle Ben. If you want a better Spider-Man, go watch the old school animated series. Go as far as to watch the one about Mysterio, it's Oscar worthy compared to this Disney imposter Spider-Man movie.Please scrap this whole Spider-boy...I mean, Iron boy, oops, I mean Spider-Man and wait for a company, director, and writer who actually love Spider-Man to make the next generation of Spider-Man movies.",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Worst spiderman movie ever,"Seriously the worst Spiderman movie I've watched. The first three movies in my opinion were the best. In this film Peter Parker is portrayed as a hyperactive, silly, and immature teenager. They make him seem very weak and unimportant compared to other avengers. Furthermore I disagree with the use of gadgets and high tech suit. This is not how Spiderman should be portrayed and remembered. Honestly Spiderman is my favourite superhero and I grew up with him, but with the original Spiderman not this silly version and I'm just sad that people will now have this view of Spiderman instead of how Spiderman used to be and SHOULD be.261 out of 416 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,"What is the ""Best Spidey"" about this?","Spider-Man is one of the most famous superhero out there. We've seen different reincarnation over time, many different cartoons, comics and even movies. But in the core, there is a ""true"" Spider-Man version, based on 70s and 80s comics. Both 80s and 90s cartoons were adaptations of those adventures. 90s cartoon had more modern and better art style and animations, Therefore, most fan take it as the most faithful adaptation of the comics.Spider-Man movie made by Sam Raimi had its polemical issues, like organic web shooters. With the second movie, he sorted the bad aspects of the first movie and only amplified the good aspects, and created a really good movie with the spirit of classical adventures. But at the third movie, he went into a wrong direction and it become the downfall of his series.When Sony wanted to reboot the series instead of a new sequel, they created a version more faithful to the Ultimate Spider-Man comic books. That movie was not bad, it was fun, but it was not ""the classic Spidey"" and there were mixed reactions for this one. Gwen Stacy in this movie was so good that they wanted to recreate the classic story about her for the second movie. But that movie failed hard, harder than the Spider-Man 3, even if it was not that bad.Sony had to reboot Spider-Man once more. This time, they went to Marvel for their help. But Marvel had its plans about ""new version of Spider-Man"". They were pushing Miles Morales FOR A LONG TIME. In their mind, ""real Spider-Man should be Miles Morales"". Therefore they were mocking with the Peter Parker for a time. For example Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon. They alienated their own fans with that cartoon and cancelled creatively beautiful version of Spectacular Spider-Man just for that cartoon.When this two forces collide, we got the Spider-Man: Homecoming. Everyone loves this movie, praises it, even in IMDb everyone believes this is the ""best spidey"" since the beginning of time. Why? Because Marvel tell us so. We must obey them and praise this shitty version of him.Don't get me wrong. I also was hyped during the Civil War movie. We've seen a part of him there, it reminded us the Classic Spider- Man especially with that cool costume.However, they changed the ""Classic"" image in the movie really really much.One of the problem in the movie, they are trying very hard to be ""SJW-friendly"". Most of the cast changed into ""People of Colors"" and of course that means African American or Mexican people. America believes ""People of Colors"" only means African American and Mexican. And of course, this is the current year, so, they put PoC everywhere. Flash Gordon, that ""white supremacist"" looking bully? Yes, he is a PoC hipster now. Liz, love interest of Peter Parker, of course PoC. Sidekick for Peter? Of course PoC. What about a MJ substitute, definitely PoC.Don't get me wrong, I don't expect a yellow hair blue eyes white supremacy idealism in the movie. But I also don't want modern day politics pushed even above Spider-Man. We didn't have to hear how producers of this movie disapproves slavery by a very planned dialogue. Please leave us from your forced politics.This is because Marvel changed this movie into a ""Disney XD"" show. Even the ""Aunt May"" changed into a Disney XD style MILF mom. Where is our beloved Aunt May? Nowhere. This is the current year, old is outdated and hipster is the new cool.""OK cut the crap man, we understood you hate the SJW politics, What about the Spider-Man?"" Sadly this Spider-Man version is even worse. He turned into whipping boy for Iron Man and his enemies. The famous loner Spider-Man is now an errand boy for Tony Stark. Every time he talks with his phone, movie feels like to do forced and rushed jokes to ""entertain"" its young audience. No, Spider-Man you are not funny, cartoon adaptation of this movie is even less funny. After all these years, we still stuck at high school level. Even in comic books, he finished high school very early and started a young adult life. Even 80s cartoons and 90s cartoon happens in that period. But hey, we need to do Spider-Man a teenager just to appeal teenagers. Right?The worst part of this movie is, following the modern movie style: everything is so staged, timing is planned and nothing happens natural. This stupid trend makes the movies artificial and synthetic. And it destroys the immersion for the audience.If you really believe this is the Best Spidey, then please at least go and watch the Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon.",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Totally Mess,"I usually don't don't listen too much to critics or reviewers when I want to go see a movie, and I try as much as possible to not have any expectation or preconception. This time I regret deeply for not listening to users who have warn us not to go see this movie. It is the first movie where I felt I was being robbed and I wanted my money back. It was so bad that it took forever for it to end. I am SHOCKED when I see the rating of this mess. I just can't believe people rated so high - it is beyond me. Does teenagers really accept this low standard? How could Marvel accept this nonsense production is another interesting thing to meditate. Side-by-side, Iron Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man series or Batman vs Superman look like masterpieces when comparing to Homecoming.Some reviewers had the actual nerve to say this is better than Spider- Man 2. What?! It's like comparing a Rembrandt to a kitsch painting - yes, it's that bad.One IMDb user described exactly how this movie is: like a very long trailer for something cool - something that never appeared on the screen. Too bad, because I really liked Tom Holland.I refuse to go review on detail because it really doesn't deserve the attention.I warn everyone that wants at least a decent flick: DON'T go see it, as you will regret it!I just really don't get how this have 8 stars. HOW? HOW? HOW?",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Worst Marvel film so far (worst Spider-Man),"I am a huge Marvel and DC fan, not crazy about the accuracy of things as long as the overall story is told.I actually loved the original Spider-Man movies with Tobey Maguire and even though there was no need for a reboot the ones with Andrew Garfield were pretty great too. Both versions had Gwen Stacy (first love) and Mary Jane (2nd love) and both versions had the Spider-Man origin, which more or less stuck to the actual comics.Spider-Man Homecoming takes everything everyone knows about Spider-Man and throws it out the window. As others have commented no idea how Stan Lee accepted this... if he had any choice at all.Bear in mind that the Marvel hero rights is a complicated matter, they belong to different groups and they could have the last say. Spider-Man belongs to SONY Pictures and not to Marvel Studios, obviously this latest film was a collaboration of the studios. Most of the X-Men stuff and fantastic 4 belonging to 20th Century Fox. Seeing an Avengers/X-Men/Fantastic 4 movie crossover is highly unlikely... shame as the comics did it.Going back to this movie, they simply bastardised Spider-Man, everything that made him special is gone, his back-story and origin is gone. If you have no idea who Spider-Man is, if you did not watch any of the earlier movies then you will love it as there is nothing wrong with the film besides Spider-Man's non existent sense of responsibility towards anyone or anything. Destroy that family's house, sure who cares; blow 100 cars up, yeah why not; almost killing 100's of people go ahead Spidey that's what makes a hero. Everyone finding out your secret identity hell why not... As an added bonus and insult, Spider-Man now has an approved Stark suit on, just remember never to enable KILL MODE!!! No idea what would happen if you do, would love to see it though:) OH and of course as many other reviewers have said, throw in the politically correctness, use every race and mix it all up (Red Heads, Blondes and big white jocks... make them all clever, Mixed Race, African-American and Asian-Indian).They could have just simply done a Spider-Man Origins movie... AGAIN and then crossed over with the Avengers. They could have used either Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield without upsetting the fans. Simple, Iron man needed help during the Civil War and Spider-Man was a Pro-Registration or whatever. The Civil War was a lot more complicated than the previous Captain America film with a lot more heroes including Fantastic 4 and the Spider-Man group but hey at least that was more or less on point.P.S. Two of the people I was watching the movie with fell asleep:)))",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Overrated Garbage! Worst Spiderman Movie EVER!,"Spideman: Homecoming was TERRIBLE and by far the worst spider-man film. This movie was a HUGE set back for Spiderman but sadly we live in a very tight lip controlled marvel press that have told us this is ""great movie"" because it came from another soulless product cake factory from marvel. This is the same Spiderman/Peter Parker from Civil War??? They severely dumbed him down for his solo movie and turned him into whiny clumsy idiot who screwed up constantly. Despite that Tom Holland is the best on screen Peter Parker and Spiderman to date. He deserved a MUCH better movie.I like Michael Keaton but his performance felt phoned in only to find that Keaton turned down this role twice before excepting it. Not his fault, am I'm the only one who thought the Vulture was lame? He was so hollow and them tying it up with the whole Damage Control thing felt forced and rushed.The high school stuff in this movie is awful. This movie was trying to so hard to be a John Hughes movie and it failed miserably. Homecoming was nothing like those movies. The teens in those movies were real, they smoked, drinked, swore, and acted like real teens. The supporting teen cast in Homecoming are nothing but terrible caricatures. Liz is a stock love interest with all the personality of a dry brick. She's useless and Laura Harrier and Tom Holland have zero chemistry. I never bought that these two liked each other. All they're very few scenes together are awkward. Flash was turned from a big jock bully bully into a annoying little doucebag who's about as threatening as a newborn kitten. Ned is stock fat friend comic relief who's not funny at all. Michelle was some wannabe hipster Daria type girl who hate everything. She served no purpose and the twist with character at the end was so forced and stupid. Aunt May's transformation into an object of male gaze/desire (and nothing more). No mention of Uncle Ben which is ridiculous. I didn't need to see him die again, but replacing Tony Stark as Uncle Ben's place as a father figure is absolutely ludicrous!Dull washed out cinematography. This looked like a TV movie. Michael Giacchino's uninspired score. Bad CGI on Spiderman, it looked WAY too cartoon. The action scenes were forgettable and had zero stakes. The Rubble scene had potential but it was poorly done, rushed, and ruined by water reflection with Tony's voice over. It's sucks because Holland acted his but off in that scene. All the Avengers/MCU references were forced and shoehorned it was eye rolling. The worst was the F, Marry, Kill game with Thor, Hulk, and Iron Man during the gym class. Really??? Speaking of gym class, those Captain America PSA segments were unfunny pointless filler. Jon Watts was a poor pick to direct this movie. His direction is bland and uncreative. He also doesn't know how to direct action scenes. At least the Raimi movie had their own distinctive zany kooky style. Homecoming looks like every other MCU movie. This movie also had 6, yes SIX writers and it's shows.The The forced diversity is so in your face. His best friends is Filipino, love interest is biracial, his bully is Guatemalan, weird girl is black, the Chinese and African kid on the decathlon team. No story-line progression. The movie is Peter wants to impress Mr. Stark to become an Avenger. That's.... it. The terrible childish comedy. ""Hur duh penis parker"", ""I was watching porn"", ""your aunt is so hot"". This is the comedy were supposed to laugh at? What was with the cringe built by slaves comment in the Washington scene? That has no place in a spider-man movie.Bottom line! Spiderman: Homecoming is another over-hyped Summer blockbuster that will be forgotten about after a month which is exactly what happened. These MCU movies have no staying power. I already forgot Guardians 2 came out 3 months ago. By the way that movie also sucked too!",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Is this for 3 year old kids?,"I mean Spider-man is a smart kid. But in this movie is like you watching a retard playing hero. Absolute no LOGIC!

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Horrible,"I would've give this movie a 5/10, but it's boring. Seriously boring.First of all, the movie is a generic teenage.. superhero movie. Filled with clich√©s. A lot of clich√©. I really hate that they set Peter Parker as a pretty stupid person. Very stupid, very naive for a 15 yo lad. If you are 15 yo and would not cross any of what he did as stupid, than you have brain damage.Second, The movie is not faithful to the original work, or what you would expect from a Spider-Man movie. They dropped in some Star tech to basically skip everything, the web-shooting is the same. There is a whole 10 second when he invents the web-fluid. That's it. I understand that it would be boring, but they cut these things and it's even more boring. How?The camera work is okay for mid budget movie. The director thrown in some special ""camera work"" which is around 2-5 minutes long, and will annoy the hell out of you. Of course it's at the start of the movie.In the first 20 minutes I almost fallen asleep, I closed my eyes a lot. Half the cinema was sighing and were watching the phone clocks. Which was kind of a... very negative.. feedback. I watched it later on the computer, if I let something out. For internet arguing. But.. this is just not an okay movie. Not even a ""meh"". It's bad.It's so bad, that the bully is basically a standard Arab guy - that they probably put in for diversity - who calls Peter a genital. A bully used to be a thing, and it used to be a muscular aggressive man, that hit and kicked Peter. A real bully. Realistic. Now.. it's just.. a guy.. It's very shameful.I really don't recommend it.",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Worst Spidey to Date,"I have seen all the Spiderman movies up to date, and let me tell you, this one was the worst of them all. Disney's marvel send us straight back to those bad cringeworthy kids 90's TV shows. That was full of cheese and unfunny forced jokes with a very thin story line. The only positive thing about the new Spiderman movie is Michael Keaton and Tom Holland. they do a good job in this mess of a movie. But that dont save the movie when over 60 years of what made Spiderman great, gets tossed out. Everything can be summed up in one word: incompetence. If you are a fan of Spiderman do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.80 out of 135 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Dubious Reviewers in force.,"I CAN NOT and WILL NO LONGER believe that these reviews are impartial. This movie is a joke - and the joke is played upon the viewer. The Plot - if you can call it a plot - is so thin that any FX (No matter how 'cool') are just pure irrelevance. Don't get me wrong... the kid playing Spider-Man - 'Tom Holland' - does a fine job - the supporting Actors (Most of greater fame / experience and talent) also do theirs. The problem is... the PLOT - which, as stated above, is so clich√©'d as to be worthless. Keaton does his usual ham-fisted approach to acting (perhaps I should have put 'ham' in uppercase). Robert Downey Jr. is his usual blas√© self (Obviously - he'd already been paid). To waste Marisa Tomeis' skills is just an insult, not to mention Jon Favreau and Gwyneth Paltrows' undoubted talent. The very fact that this movie received a 7.8 star rating is enough to show that rigging is in process. I'd go through the plot - bit by bit - to try and get across my dismay at the so-called acclaim this piece of excrement received but I wouldn't want to waste 2 and a half minutes of your time - because, truly, that's about the length this movie should have been.",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Entertainment for 12-year olds,"If you are 12 years old and below, you will love this movie and give it a high rating. But if you're over 12 you will be very annoyed by this movie. The dialogue is so immature and boring that it will put you to sleep. The acting is the worst I have ever seen in a movie. It's like they just picked a bunch of people off the street and put them in front of the camera. The plot is no better, its like a 6 year old wrote it. If you are over 12 years old and you enjoyed this movie I suggest you check yourself into a mental health institution with immediate effect.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Leave spidy alone!,"My real rating for this movie is 3 stars, but since it has a rating of 7.7 as of writing these lines, I feel it's my moral duty to lower the average as much as I can.All in all, this is a decent humor clad movie, but it's mere existence is a troubling progression in an ongoing factory of the ruining of our childhood heroes for the occasional buck.So the occasional jokes are funny and the sidekick character is hella cute, but all these aren't a movie make. What is lacking is a reason why I, aka the viewer, should give a damn about what is going on. A movie is supposed to take you on a ride, to meet and accompany a character or a group in a journey that is meaningful in a way to them, experience the emotions through them. This feat is achieved by good writing and directing, a wholesome and insightful crafting of a story.Spiderman:homecoming is like a jigsaw of gimmicks that have been rearranged by an eager toddler to make a colorful but oh so wrong picture, at the expense of our friendly neighborhood spidy.",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Another death for a iconic comic figure/idea,"If you've seen this movie, you really see what is wrong with the world we live in: it destroys originality and creativity. In this movie, there is basically not an ounce of the original Spiderman, period. The same as happened to Star Trek and Star Wars after former commercial movie makers took over. There is simply nothing left of the original. I could go on and list all the drawbacks and dis-functionalities, but it simply makes no sense, cause there is nothing in there. So, my conclusion: nothing to be seen here of any importance, let alone Spiderman. Save your precious time and skip this movie!20 out of 30 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Worst spidey ever,"I grew up reading Spider-Man and I still have several of those original issues tucked away in the closet, to be passed on. I was excited when this movie started but that excitement was gone within the first few minutes. I found myself watching a political propaganda movie put out in the guise of a real Spider-Man movie. If you love a steady diet of politics then this movie is for you. If not.. then don't even bother because it starts out political and just stays political.

The humour is 3rd grade level. Save your money, stay home and watch reruns of Gilligan's island instead. This movie goes on and on for like 2-1/2 hours with absolute stupidity.It is more of a really bad sit-com mixed with the plot from the mighty ducks.

If you've watched the trailer, you can skip the movie. You will find nothing better in the actual movie. And post-credit scene is totally not worth waiting (I'm strongly against any post-credit scenes anyway). If you want to watch a coming-of-age, Disney-type of kids movie, then it is for you.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Is this movie a joke ? This ...thing pretends to be a next spider-man movie ? One of the worst movie ever made.,"I've already started my opinion within a subject. This movie is a joke. Screenplay is... wait there is almost no screenplay at all. It looks like multiple scenes joined together by using superglue. And why the heck they are mixing everything from great Marvel's world in one movie?! Hollywood crew is destroying Marvel's world. Instead of focusing on particular Marvel hero per movie we have a mix of multiple heroes. So when I'm watching new movie with Marvel's logo on it I'm confused - is this an Iron Man ? or maybe Thor ? oh no wait its Avengers! Heck no its spider-man! Who that heck is creating such scenarios now ? Accountants , bankers , sponsors ? Looks like no one who knows what a good movie is. This... thing (new ""spider-man"") is one big s... . Why the hell they mixed the spider-man with the Avengers movie and IronMan ??? What a stupid idea which destroying both heroes. Screenplay is dramatic, directing is poor, actors has not been selected well for particular roles. The new spider man actor - sorry but who the heck is this ? Some punk who looks like 5 years old kid from kindergarten ? Who's son he is ? A producer or director is his father so they've chose him for this role ? Is this a joke ? Spider-man was a student - about 20-24 years old. The gang of villains is completely bad chose. Only the main character - Michael Keaton - should be well known actor to emphasize his position. Soundtrack ... wait what soundtrack. Some 5 years old kids drawing a pictures and singing at the end of the movie ? WTF!!! Take a look at the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. Professional artists not some fu... kids. And what is completely sick is the political correctness in this movie - maybe Obama was a director? Michael Keaton character (white guy) has ... black wife. They are completely not matching each other. Man ""hero"" (yeah right) girlfriend is ... who can guess ? YES its BLACK. Main character best friend is... Asian. Kid in the toilet is... Asian. etc etc. WTF. I they want to spread and promote the multi-culti sh... let they make some local movie instead of using Hollywod top characters for this sh... Have you ever seen Asians who mixed white people in their main production ? NO. Only Asians are there. Have you ever seen white people in the Bollywood (India movies) ? NOPE, only India actors are there etc. etc. So why the heck Hollywood is putting this multi-culti ideas in movies like spider-man:homecoming ???????? Let they make movie about Clinton, other politicians, businessman's and PIZZA GATE (pedophilia case in US) if they want to make a movie about some public subject. This movie is a joke.",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Not Fresh,"Where to begin? I guess we could start with the kid who plays Spiderman - that kid can not act and is about as exciting as dirt. In fact, I found his very presence to be irritating and it made me long for Toby of all things. Then, the bad guy looked and shared some of the same traits of another bad guy with the initials green goblin only without any super power. The cgi was so bad as to make me long for the first spiderman and it started from the very beginning when be jumped over a fence - it looked terribly fake. And tony stark - when can we get a fresh actor instead of using the same old boring ones they always use. And bring the actress back for two minutes to play pepper or whatever her name is - what a ripoff of just slapping actors in place who are only still famous because they were in ironman.

Talk about overuse of coincidence to push the script forward.99.9 PERCENT OFF THE JOKES were totally lame-o. What a poorly written and paced movie.Heck,Spiderman 1 & 2 are still the best Spiderman movie IMHO. The MCU misfired spectacularly here. For the first time the DCEU have a way better movie than the MCU in the form of Wonder Woman. And the post credit scene sucked majorly too.What a letdown. I'm hoping this is a one off misstep and that the MCU will bounce back majorly with Thor Ragnarok.smfh21 out of 35 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,What is this garbage?! It isn't Spider-Man!,"Spider-Man has always been among my favorite comic book superheroes--until this movie. True, I read the comics and watched the cartoons long ago, so some things might have changed about the source material. But as far as I know, even in Peter's teen years, he never had a boss telling him which crime to fight and which to leave to the ""adults"" and he never needed one. Then Disney's Marvel went and gave him a boss and they made it Tony Snark (misspelling intended). My Spider-Man is an independent, basically self-sufficient, brilliant, caring underdog whose wisecracks made me laugh, even when I was reading them from dialogue bubbles. This Spider-Man, this whiny impostor, has a jerk for a mentor, another jerk for a ""supervisor"", an artificially intelligent suit that was made FOR him (complete with training wheels) and--for almost the entire movie--the sole purpose of impressing Snark enough to get a seat at the Avengers' grown-up table.People praise this movie for providing a so-called more accurate depiction of an adolescent Peter and his troubles. But what troubles? A crush on a girl? Haven't other movies done teenage woes, discomfort and humiliation a thousand times better? I'm pretty sure even Raimi's first Spider-Man movie did a better job of that! I'm not going to waste any more of my time on this counterfeit Spider-Man.",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Fooled by previews,"Suckered me in on this one. Preview made it look like Iron Man had taken Spidy under his wing -- mentor and trainee sort of action. Turns out this is material written about a teen searching for puberty and had only a cameo or two of Avengers. Then there's Hollywood dishing out PC-ism to the 10th level. Peter is the token white character, with no white friends at all. That isn't any more disconcerting than being preached to or brainwashed -- often subtle, but at other times flagrantly -- by the writers of this tripe.

And also you leaved in a cave and never seen any spider-man movies. Then you are the public they targeted.If you like beautiful movies with perfect pictures lightning scene music script and a bit of thinking just run away.This movie is also the lost for me of the spider man character... he first series of 3 film was good, then with the reboot I wasn't sure at first. but the amazing spider-man 2 his a masterpiece. and apparently will remain like it. because apparently marvel just f***** everything... ha-ha.The funny fact is they wan't to get close to the original series because spider-man is supposed to be among avenger's. But because the avenger movie and universe they created is such a piece of crap with no human sense in it they just get rid of all spider-man story of the comics to and this one an only specific garbage feature.RIP",1

But the models have to be appropriate to the time in which you are living, and our time has changed so fast that what was proper fifty years ago is not proper today.¬†The virtues of the past are the vices of today. And many of what were thought to be the vices of the past are the necessities of today. The moral order has to catch up with the moral necessities of actual life in time, here and now.¬†And that is what we are not doing. The old-time religion belongs to another age, another people, another set of human values, another universe. By going back you throw yourself out of sync with history. Our kids lose their faith in the religions that were taught to them, and they go inside.""Spider-Man is completely unique. He has trouble paying his rent. He is unpopular and can't get the girl, his aunt nags him, he has to work to get through school, he's bullied, an orphan, an outcast, and despite his super powers, struggles with the same everyday life issues as everyone else, an ""everyman,"" flawed, enduring grief and loss, going through identity crisis, full of fear and insecurity, his expressiveness released the moment the suit is donned (the opposite of the god-like, omnipotent ""hero""), reveals our all too human failure and vulnerability (and hence resulting in escapism), for even with his accidental powers, he could not save or protect his loved ones, and living in the real world of Hell's Kitchen and New York City only makes him all the more real. Due to the common problems we all experience, we can all relate to the fantasy of escaping into super human grandiosity wishes (the rock star, the astronaut, the Indiana Jones adventurer), for Heroes with personal problems allows us to suspend disbelief, supercharged by awe, due our connection and attunement with the struggles of the hero. Stan Lee realized, most genuinely, if someone is just pretending to be a regular person but is secretly really a superhero, then the implication is this: ""they aren't really like you and me at all."" Superman PRETENDS to be nerdy and unsure of himself, but he's not really. So all those kids who are really nerdy and unsure of themselves fail to relate to him, because the message is ""he's not REALLY like you, it's just a trick."" But Peter Parker isn't pretending to be a normal guy and a nerd, he really IS those things. So the implication is, perhaps there's a hero deep down inside of you as well, because that superhero Spider-Man looks cool in his costume and everyone thinks he's so confident, but inside he's just like you and me.And now we have Homecoming, an unforgivably polished, fully funded betrayal; the acting, screenplay, cinematography and special effects though superb, effectively exterminate the true voice of the actual character, one who despite all odds rises above his terminable uniqueness to become a heroic community leader, like MLK. As much as I felt unease at the overly simplistic and childish Tobey McGuire portrayal, at least Sam Raimi and the rest refused to bow down to corporate producers and stay true to the myth, unlike this sordid piece of overproduced trash. And as for the cutely portrayed John Favreau and Robert Downey Jr., do you two have any integrity? Do you not have enough money yet? I guess not, for money is more important to you than creating a movie millions upon millions of adolescents could have grasped onto, relate to, and find some meaning in, you two absolute failures as creative artists.And as for the vulture, in the comics was a diseased, repugnant utterly sorrowful being, without family or friends, who replaced the disillusionment of the working class failure/hero with a megalomania cal charlatan dressed in the pale, paltry robes of the true revengeful vulture, one who preys upon the carcasses of resentment, ugly beyond recognition, abandoned by all he had left, his meaningless job, is unforgivably counterfeited here, replaced by a numbly glib and smugly empty, boringly hollow Michael Keaton (whom I suspect did a by the numbers performance by the chains imposed by his enabling handlers). It makes me sick to my soul as we regale and worship this antithesis, pounding one more nail into the coffin lid on the myth of spider man. This sickening piece of trash is a fraud, a lie, made all the more detestable and despicable by the gate-keeping, flaccid meaninglessness of the creative killing producers. Boycott this film with every fiber of your being. Boycott it I say! Boycott it in defiance of the mythology it discounts, discredits and invalidates. Boycott it I say! Boycott for nothing else than another manifestation of the soulless, numbers crunching, vapid surface level symptom it is. Boycott it because you know you love the real and true Spider-man, the one who tried to rescue Mary Jane but failed, the one whose resentment resulted in the death of Uncle Ben, the one who gave you hope that you too, in all your nerdy, pockmarked abandon, could get the girl and be cool despite all the odds. Thanks.",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Basically a Poor B movie,This Spider-Man feels like it was made for a bunch of young teenagers. Bed writing and fair acting. I feel like they used Tony Stark just to get people to fill seats in the theater. Save your money. Wait for it to come out on Redbox if you must see it. Don't support this garbage. Both previous Spider-Man movies were far better than this. I think they could have found a better actor to portray Peter Parker. Marvel needs to be more serious about this role if they are gonna keep Spider-Man going.23 out of 44 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,What a Crap,"This is the most irritating movie i have ever seen, this movie is awful and unbearable mainly because of the pathetic acting of Tom Holland, he was so irritating that i enjoyed the scenes where his back side was kicked. Not even a single actor did justice to this character, it felt like every one including the actors and the director were in a hurry to finish it.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,"Ruined the spider-man series, Ironman is shown as his boss/father figure.","I have never written a review on IMDb but I had to write one for this ABOMINATION of a movie!Throughout the movie, I kept thinking okay, now they will show spider-man to be sensible, intelligent and logical kind of guy, but NO, they kept portraying spider-man as an idiot, careless, illogical, immature guy who is nothing more than a side-kick for Iron man.By the way, Iron-man is the most overrated superhero in Marvel universe. He is just an old guy with a high tech suit, that suit can't protect him from sudden loss of momentum, yet we are shown Ironman falling from great heights, taking heavy damages. The suit doesn't have any shock absorbing properties, still somehow a 50 year old guy becomes INVINCIBLE after wearing a thin metal suit, total BS.Oh, I couldn't digest this spider-man crap and I left the theater within 1 hour, YES IT'S THAT BAD!",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Poor acting! Waste of time and money,This film was full of poor acting and a very weak story line. Lots of pointless scenes added just to create a longer and more painful film.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Don't get triggered,"I'm giving this film a rating of one to counterbalance the over abundance of perfect scores.This is far from a perfect film...No character arc... no compelling score... little tension... awkward pacing... weak villains (sorry Michael Keaton)... Stark saving Peter (ruining the tension)... Stark making Peter's suit... bad 'love interest'... no influence character... etc.But then again there was some good things...Alright humour (not really my type but it should please a good few people).... good cinematography... no over-dramatic nonsense... an okay twist (only okay because it breaks up the ineffectiveness of the film and creates some well needed tension)... etc.And there was a brilliant thing...That being the fact that the school students actually look like teenagers (and not thirty year olds pretending to be sixteen). Because of this I have a lot of confidence that these characters - particularly the main cast - will grow out of their awkward adolescent phase and grow to be quite compelling characters.The reason I can forgive this film is because my teenage years, too, were quite awkward, especially when I look back on it nowadays; and the reason why I'm hopeful for the sequels to come is because I believe these characters will grow up to be something amazing (unlike myself).Honestly I'd give this film a 4 out of 10, but I no doubt love Tom Holland as both Spidy and Peter Parker.",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Review,"It gives me a headache this movie sucks. Spider-Man: Homecoming is the purest example of style over substance. At first, it seems like all is well, the beginning is great, but it all falls apart during the second act. All of the characters are one-note and one-dimensional. Everything is on a surface level with this movie. There's no depth to any of the characters at all. The Vulture is mad, that's it. Peter Parker / Spider- Man is dealing with his issues, but there easily solved in a mediocre way of storytelling.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Racist Liberal Agenda in full swing,"The liberal agenda was ripe in this movie! All the love interests were mixed race, apparently according to Marvel the next generation of people should all be not one race but mixed with at least black, no more whites. Oh and any historical contributions by whites should be written over, based on an actual comment by a black girl about the Washington Monument being built by slaves. Yes they said that. And a classroom where all the pictures of ""great"" people were black, but where was a picture of Abraham Lincoln? Man this kind of race baiting really sours movies for me. I bet the main characters would have been black too if Hollywood didn't know white people would not go see it. I am so tired of this obvious liberal agenda filling all the media. I give this a reverse-racism thumb up the butt.15 out of 31 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Makes Spider Man 3 look good,"Never thought i would watch a spider man movie as bad as Spider- Man.
well it is. Spider Man homecoming IS the worst Spider-Man movie AND one of the worst superhero movies in general.1. The movie feels like a low budget disney channel movie. 
2. Tom Holland as an actor is a major downgrade from Andrew Garfield. there is no doubt Andrew was a much better actor, had more emotion and was the better spider man.
3. The movie tries to replace Harry Osborn / Marry Jane Watson - with a fat asian and zendaya for MJ *sigh* yes, Zendaya out of all the people -- ZENDAYA!! i wanted to throw up.
4. Flash Thompson - Flash Thompson is now a mexican ?
5. some of the worst cinematography and action scenes for a spider movie you'll ever watch. even the people who like homecoming will admit this movie HAS the worst action scenes ever.
5. the dialogue is cringy ( there is a porn joke )
6. Spider man sucks here, the suit looks animated 80% of the movie because they actually did animate it for some reason.So if you wanna watch a good spider man movie - watch SPider- Man 1 , Spider - man 2 or The Amazing Spider man 1and even tho TASM2 and SPider man 3 have problems - they are much more enjoyable than Homecoming.",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,"Extremely poor, very cheap but highly profitable garbage.","**** No Spoilers *****
When watching any movie I begin by awarding the film 10/10 and subtract marks & add marks accordingly as the film progresses. Why? Because I'm a positive kind of guy. You're innocent until proven guilty, honest until proven dishonest. 
I've seen 1000s of movies. Those I have predicted will be classics (Shawshank Redemption 1994) are now at No1 on the IMDB data base & in many movie critics top 10. Fast forward 24 years to today. 
This is honestly the first time I've ever watched a promising film with great actors and actresses (Tyne Daly (Cagney & Lacey) Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr) deteriorate from a 10/10 to a 1/10 in literally 12 minutes. When a film hits that low I quit. You've wasted my money. You will not waste my time. It's irredeemable.Every time I subtracted a mark I thought, ""It's okay. I could edit this film. I could fix that. But then there would be another problem. Followed by another. And another until I thought, Okay. Let's ignore all that and imagine the film started from 7 minutes in. It continued to get worse until if flatlined at 1/10 by the 11th minute and I shut it down. Now I know what people are going to say. But what about the action etc that comes later? That's like expecting me to eat shxt just because there's desert afterwards. Sorry. I'm out. The film has ruined my appetite & there's an overwhelming stench coming from the directors kitchen.",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,From Hero to Bumbling Idiot,"Spider-Man is supposed to be a slightly immature, but very skilled, and intelligent high-school student.

Spider-Man (who should be the one teaching Iron Man ALL the lessons), into the one learning from Iron Man, whom Spider-Man idolizes like some bimbo blond would idolize a rock star. The movie makes Spider-Man into a slightly nerdy teenager and a really incompetent hero.The really incompetent hero spin is what totally ruined the movie - right up there with Ant-Man. Spider-Man was a great comic hero, but this movie makes Spider-Man into a Bumbling Idiot.All they needed to do was use the Vulture villain vs. the mature Spider-Man created in previous movies. Continuity, high moral grounding, and life lessons, are what I want from heroes. When I feel like I am, and have always been smarter and had more integrity than a ""hero"", then the hero is not a hero at all.",1

After that he fell in, I do not know if accidentally or he committed suicide. What do you think of that? I think nothing happens accidentally... OK, Michael Keaton and Robert Downey Jr. are two excellent actors. One more talented than the other. Robert Downey Jr. is perhaps the most versatile actor, he can play anything. Michael Keaton is also anointed with all the ointments. But money is the devil's eye, and without money you can not live. That's why you become Iron Man or Vulture...

It was very poor acting and awful dialogue.The Spider-Man films ate unfortunately getting worse and worse as are the Marvel films which pains me as I have been a big comic book and Marvel fan for a long long time.If you are above the age of 10 this film is not marketed towards you.The Marvel franchise although it started well has slowly slipped and taken certain actors with it. RDJ who I once considered an amazing actor is slipping further and further and no can only be described as a competent actor (or simply just Iron Man).

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Unapologetic misuse of a loved character,"Gone is the subtlety of previous attempts at stuffing cultural Marxism into our movies, Homecoming is a full-scale assault on western culture. Whether it is characters refusing to appreciate an American landmark because it was apparently ""built by slaves"", or the cast being ""diverse"" to the point there's barely a white face to be seen, this movie is communist politics disguised as entertainment - and I'm looking squarely at the writer, Goldstein, as being the first person responsible.I watch movies like Spider-man in an ebbing attempt to escape this constant political assault on our society. It now seems impossible. But aside from all this, I watched Spider-man to see Spider-man. Unfortunately, they've practically changed everything that made him a good character.Originally, Parker made his own suit and depended entirely on himself to navigate through the tough times, making his own decisions whether they were right or wrong. He depended on his spider-senses to warn him or help him. Now, his suit guides him, aids him and protects him. Iron Man routinely shows up to save him or shout at him, his annoying best friend knows his secret and helps him. In the end, even his (now young, hot and Italian) Aunt May discovers his secret!Jon Favreau's character seems the designated angry-man when Stark isn't available to be angry at Parker. Maybe his anger towards Peter is something which could be explained by the fact he likes to hang around and meet young boys in school toilets for absolutely NO reason whatsoever...The action sequences are equally weird. We see Spidey scurrying up the Washington Monument to save his friends at the top. The scene reminds me of John Cleese running towards the guards in Holy Grail, and resetting at the beginning each time he gets a little bit closer. Spider-man seems to take an eternity to reach the top and it saps all energy out of the action.We also have the typical Marxist-favourite ""Jesus sacrifice"" pose as he holds together a seemingly unsinkable ferry, which has literally been sliced length-ways in half, yet stays afloat. At this point I was asking out aloud - can no one else see how ridiculous this is?And that sums up this movie as far as I'm concerned.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,All I can say is that this movie is an abomination,"Its funny how this movie got such high rating when it deserves nothing,cliche jokes,cliche teenagers,everything cliche,the jokes are so lame and the way spiderman acts,total money grab from brainless teenagers,I miss the badass Spiderman Tobey Maguire,movies would have been so much better if he still was the spiderman not recycling the same thing over and over again and let it develop,BRING TOBEY MAGUIRE BACK AS SPIDERMAN,for me spiderman is a bad joke now.4 out of 10 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Silly...,"I think I'm the only one who finds this movie silly. Super predictable and more like a teen flick than a high budget action adventure movie. He doesn't even have his own identity, he's just Iron Man's puppet. All the dangerous scenarios were cliche with Spiderman unsurprisingly saving the day just in the nick of time. No surprising tension there, nor any tension at all. Even the villain and the twist with the villain was predictable. Everything about this is silly. Just doesn't live up to the rest of the MCU films. Bring the real Spiderman back.4 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Spider-Man: Homecoming,My least favorite Spiderman movie. That was horrible.,"Glad I didn't waste my money to see this at theaters. Overrated movie. Except Michael Keaton and Tom Holland, Homecoming was pretty awful. Thin plot, bad acting, poor casting, weak action scenes, dull cinematography, bland directing, no emotional weight, the forced diversity, and endlessly obnoxious references to the Avengers/MCU. Okay, we get it! The inconsistencies from Civil War annoyed me. Peter's room is completely different, Spiderman was strong and capable in Civil War, but in Homecoming he's a clumsy clown who cant do anything right, why did they change the holy ---- line in the blog? I never liked the Homecoming title. It's so cheesy. The political agenda was so unnecessary. The built by slaves line and the cowboys and Indians line made me cringe as well as that eye rolling Ferris Bueller reference. After Civil War, this was a disappointing follow up.Ôªø This wasn't a Spiderman movie, it was a lame teen comedy with Spiderman thrown in a few scenes.6 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spironman,"Hey everyone. This movie is garbage. The scene in the beginning showing texting on screen was random and cheap. Iron Man swooping in to save the ship was laughably bad. Some people definitely died during that, but they said no one died! This Spider-Man was so weak. Everything he does is just to impress Iron Man. He couldn't even make his own suit, which is just a latex Iron Man suit that talks to him.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,"What is wrong with these reviews, who is giving them","This is certainly not a great marvel movie. It was written like a sort of B-rated home alone movie. A lot of times Peter acts like he is between 5-8 years old in the humor and they use 5-8 year old music here and there like it is a Disney cartoon. They make Aunt May and his suit computer unbelievable May acts like a shy/clever sexy, the suit computer takes things personal which is generic. They try WAY too hard to make this enjoyable for really young kids, and miss the comic book fans for years. It seriously lacks good directing writing and producing. It is no where near the dynamic and humor enjoyed with the Avengers movies and others. The Toby/Garfield movies were better. I LOVE Marvel and I have seen them all and am a big fan of many, but the directing & producing with Spiderman in the Avengers movie was way way better. It is too bad, I looked forward to this. It seems a lot of people are helping to swing the ratings to get people to go, I will just say.... wait to see it for free or for a 1.59 fee or something 2 thumbs and a heart down. Into the second half is admittedly better than the first, but the reviews seem to oddly be reflecting a huge need for a money recoup than from actual reality. 85% of the movies are better than this one.",1

Need to watch the Sam Raimi or Marc Webb movies afterwards to rinse out my mind.....They really should have went with Andrew Garfield and should not have made Spider-""Boy"" such a fangirling doofus and a joke.It's a shame for the kid playing him cause his acting is okay...it's the hot garbage material and portrayal of spiderman that wrecks this movie.....Tom Holland's Spiderman is definitely the worst spiderman interpretation so far.....should have called this movie ""Homewrecking"" instead of Homecoming cause it sure as manure didn't feel like a homecoming to me.",1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Why do they keep having brits play American superheroes?,This film lost all credibility when Parker says a Dominican lady gave him a churro. Churros are made and sold by Mexicans mostly. In fact it's a widely known thing in NYC. The innacuracy here is racist and makes it seem like the writers were trying very hard to be New York.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Worst Spider Man yet,"This movie was garbage that did not get what spider man was all about at all. Seems like it was made for 10 year olds and for ironman fangirls.Wrote another review with more detail but it somehow got lost i the ether...To recap:
this is spider boy not spider man...
get rid of the stark suit...
stop making spider boy such a failure...
see the previous movies as obviously the director and writers don't have a clue...
understand that making spider man into something other than spider man isn't clever and fresh but sad and lame...
the only redeeming character in this whole movie was Vulture...
this movie is proof they should have went with Garfield..Holland got shafted with really bad material and likely will be remember by a huge huge % of spiderman fans as the guy that played the worst spider man ever...
last but not least please realize most of us paying to watch these movie are older than 10 years old...Shame on you Sony and Disney for ruining spider-man",1

Hela is about to conquer the world and kill everybody let's make a little joke. A fight started, oh, please, another little joke. Thor steps on a banana and falls down, ahahaha, funny. Loki - 0 power in all the movie, 0 spells, 0 abilities, just nothing, where was his power, he was so useless and did almost nothing in all the movie. Hulk - personality of a teenage boy on steroids.

Thor: Ragnarok,So Bad,"In the comics, Ragnarok killed every Asgardian, including Thor, and he was gone for years from the comics. The darkest story in Thor's history.So of course Marvel Studios makes it a comedy.There is nothing to this movie but jokes. It's quips, pratfall, anus jokes, Hela's kind of lame, Hulk and Thor are a comedy duo. And Thor helps Loki bring Surtur to Asgard so he can destroy it. Let me repeat that in case I wasn't clear. THOR HELPS DESTROY ASGARD AT THE END.It's just so bad.Some of the action was really good, but the forced humor didn't work in this movie.At least Marvel Studios has finally admitted that comedy is their main focus.Getting stellar reviews, of course. Because critics love the MCU and will just pretend they're masterpieces when they're not. This movie was terrible.Critics call it ""FUUUUNNNN"". But it was just lame.I wish I would have saved my money, or burned it. At least if I burned it I still would have wasted money but I wouldn't have sat through this.It sets the final stage for Infinity War, which is going to be a bloated mess.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Feels like a Monty Python' version of Thor,"(There might be some spoilers ahead but very vague.)I grew up with Marvel comics and Thor was always my favorite. None of the Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I like them. Combined with other MCU movies which were getting better and better I had big hopes for the last Thor movie.I can't even begin to describe the disappointment. I wanted to leave the theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectively destroyed everything Marvel was building all these years!I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hoped I would like something. The Story has immense potential but it was ruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate doom .... and they made a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) making fools out of themselves made it even worse.If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew it might be fun but like this ...I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I will certainly not going to watch Infinty Wars. Even more I will skip The Last Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.This is blatant attempt to attract new fans among younger generations by appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks and distractions instead of a good story and directing.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Thor Wreck-narok!,"Thor: Ragnarok should be about the twilight of the Norse gods and the end of all things (or at least Marvel's version of it). It should be darker than the Dark World. It's not. In fact, it has almost nothing to do with it. But it may well be the twilight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or it would be, if we were to stop watching such pauper productions. Marvel movies don't need to be comedies to work. In fact, they shouldn't be comedies at all. They can have elements of comedy, but that's entirely different. Many marvel heroes have a sense of humour, despite their troublesome lives; even through their hardships, they are many times portrayed as having a sense of the comic. But they are not jokers or stand up comedians. Sure, Spiderman is very funny, but his life is one of the hardest in the Marvel universe. To portray Thor, the asgardian god of thunder, as a joker or as a comedian makes no sense at all. He is one of the most sober and serious characters in the Marvel universe. He is not human, he doesn't perceive time as we do, he doesn't think about life as we do, so it makes sense that he doesn't have a sense of humour like we humans do. We could say something similar about the Grandmaster and Hella. Specially Hella. I mean, they weren't able to introduce a single moment of seriousness in the whole movie, not even in characters that shouldn't (couldn't) be laughing like mindless puppets and posing ridiculously every time they appear on screen. It would make sense if Loki was portrayed as mischievous, but that's it. And speaking of Loki, and since this is the Ragnarok after all, they completely distorted the fact that he is the father of the three agents of the destruction of the world: Hella, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent (there's no world serpent in the movie). Marvel movies can be successful and yet sober. Captain America: Winter Soldier is probably one the best movies of the MCU and it's as sober as it gets. Iron Man (the first installment) deals with the threat of terrorism and weapons trade; it has many comic and funny moments, it's true, but it has a very serious tone underlying it. (This Tony Stark works because of Robert Downey Jr., who is amazing, but the Tony Stark from the comics is paralyzed from the waist down - it doesn't get any more serious than that). Avengers Assemble may not be as sober, but it still manages not to become a comedy show. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 was a hit, but it was a joke. It had nothing to do with the first one. It wasn't good. In fact, it was kind of a ""prequel"" for Thor:Ragnarok - for these comedy shows. And if someone thinks I'm exaggerating, just think about that moment when Matt Damon is portraying Loki in that ""theater play"". I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. It looks like a Jimmy Kimmel show!!! I'm sorry, but Taika Waitiki failed. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle failed tremendously. I really hope that Infinity War isn't a ""sequel"" to this kind of movie. If it is...please stop. Just stop with this kind of writing. Remember that we, in the audience, are not morons, and that not only kids in their early teens go to the movies. Just think about Logan or Deadpool (not a comedy show, although extremely funny). Forget the PG system, forget the money (you'll make it anyway), forget the special fx. And please, forget this Thor and forget any ideas of turning Infinity War into something like this. If not, we'll have Thanos (Thanos!!!!) cracking jokes all the time...",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"Embarrassing, Terrible, Awful. Total Trash.","I was with high spectations that Marvel would do the perfect Thor movie, with Ragnarok background story. My mistake was to believe in this.This movie has nothing to offer, other than silly and not-even-a-bit funny ""jokes'. Its like Taika was drunken and write the movie while being kissed by a horse, or a giant flying metal alien whale (Avengers one). There are no good fight/action. There are no chemistry between the characters. The ""journey"" take them from A to A: they don't go anywhere with this.Hulk seems like a Marvel version of Shrek, from Dreamworks.

Thor: Ragnarok,Thor Ragnarok... Truly Ragnarok in all the sense of the word.,Whilst the movie was enjoyable I wasn't expecting a comedy. it is a slapstick comedy from Marvel or something that was created for school children. I know that you have to sell a product that doesn't mean you make an action movie or a hero movie Or a superhero movie do a total slapstick comedy full of puns and one-liners making me think I'm watching a 90s superhero movie with 2017 digital effects if you wanted to characterize this as a comedy and then probably I would have given in the higher score but since it was in my word superhero movies it deserves the lowest score that can be given the director was great but if this was meant to be a comedy nothing new or groundbreaking does not even compare to anything good only reason it is getting good reviews is because the rest of the movies in the box office are below par or not superhero movies. Expected a lot but was severely disappointed. Slot of missed opportunities.,1
Thor: Ragnarok,Thor Ragnarok officially made me give up on Cinema!,"After waiting for Thor: Ragnarok for years. This movie is perhaps, the WORST Marvel movie I have ever seen.Poor story-telling, weak character development, scenes felt out of place and total 360 from what Thor is supposed to have been.Hollywood blockbusters have been lowering the complexity of its stories to get more butts into the movie seats which include kids who might not be able to understand a more dark, realistic and complex story. This comes at the expense of adult audience who like to see a characters inits true form.This movie is basically Logan in reverse. It is a total betrayal of the character's true nature.The following are the movie sins committed in this flick; Warning Spoilers ahead!1) Bad Story-line.. This story doesn't allow characters to evolve or grow, a lot of the acting seems too familiar or forced for the sake of moving the movie forward or getting a reaction out of you.2) Everything happens so fast without explanation of events or relationships... a) Why did thor figure out that Loki was impersonating Odin now and not before? b) How was the all-powerful Odin enchanted by Loki? c) Why did Odin decide to let Hela to Invade Asgard and why did he decide to disappear? d) How did Hela break Thor's hammer? e) Why did the leader of Sakaar favorite Hulk over Thor?2) No setup from previous events and no purpose for charactersa) Thor and Hulk somehow ended up on the same planet by accident b) Why did Dr. Strange need to be in this movie besides setting up for a thor-strange relationship in a future Marvel movie? c) Why didn't Odin hint in previous films that thor had an evil sister named Hela?3) Bad actingEven Tom Hiddlesto was off point, he had the usual devious smirk on his face but I sometimes wondered if he was expressing contempt at the directors of the film. Besides being a remarkable film crew with amazing actors, somehow this movie manages to bring out the worst acting of these stars.Heres a basic breakdown of each characterThor: A more emotional, funny and light-hearted ThorLoki: The same devious mischief with no new tricks up his sleeve, Loki is so predictable that even Thor has figured him out.Hela: The sorority club's biggest drama-queen, nothing mysterious or godlike about her. Even she falls into the joke frame.Heimdall: He had some good scenes and had a nice mystical look to him but wasn't very much useful in the movie.Grandmaster: This guy is supposed to be a ruler of a planet, instead he belongs on a SNL skit.Valkyrie: Independent strong woman, alcoholic, with both middle fingers up in your face. Somehow this quickly triggered ghetto character manages to defeat Loki in a battle for the sake of showing how women are strong too?Skurge: He betrayed Asgard for the whole movie and then tries to make up for it in less then 5 frames before he dies.Bruce Banner / Hulk: Even hulk manages to turn himself into a comedian.Doctor Strange: Earth's best sorcerer tools Asgardian gods such as Thor and Loki who should have far greater knowledge of magick then Dr. Strange.The Executioner: somehow managed to betray Asgard by serving Hela for the entire film, but then sacrifices himself at the end and we're expected to sympathize with this guy?Korg: This was a loony toons version of KorgTo seal the cherry on the cake, Thor basically lets and assists Asguard to be blown up to pieces, because he figures it will destroy Hela, someone who he wasn't able to defeat even with his new powers.The disappointment I felt after watching it sure caused a big disconnect for me after I came back home only to read all the positive reviews written by Critics and users alike, which made me question if these Critics are insiders, and if the users are in fact real accounts...I know everybody's got to make some money... but at what expense?",1
Thor: Ragnarok,This movie failed in every possible level.,"I'm not a hater of comic book-based movies, and it is difficult, considering 2/5 of the movies that appear in movie theaters are based on comic book, if you want to see a movie with action and effects, in the end you always end up with one or another of this type of movie. Blame Hollywood and the mentality of wanting to get the milk from the cow in greater quantity in the shortest possible time.And this movie fails on almost every level, first, the movie begins with a set piece when Thor confronts a fire demon, before this, begins a monologue of this demon on Ragnarok. Honestly, who was the amateur puts such a big exposition before an action scene. And in the midst of these two things, Thor begins to make jokes about being attached to chains. Honestly the editing of this movie is horrible.And that goes for the whole movie. Another example, Odin ends up dying at the end of the first act, and soon afterwards appears an action scene with Hela. The public still barely chewed Odin's death scene - scene loses all emotional impact - a set piece appears which should have an emotional impact - the destruction of Thor's hammer - turns out to have no impact at all. Worse, both scenes lost their impact and ended up canceling each other out.The editing is so horrible, the pace is so fast that not only the emotional scenes lose their emotional focus, the action scenes are flawed and the suspense scenes do not work and the whole movie is gone down the drain, in which the movie can not be chewed and the movie looks like a Mcdonald's meal. Just a factory product. In addition, the film addresses the destruction of a civilization and a race - in this case Asgard - of such a simplistic manners, and in such a hurried way. This film needs (at least) 3 hours for development and make an satisfactory establish for the final battle (considering how many subplots this movie has), instead this is a 2 hours film of second-rate jokes.A movie to fill your eyes, but nothing is left in the mind and because of this movie is easily forgotten after the credits pass. Even the special effects are horrendous. The Hulk continues to be a digital doll and being made by a computer - what's the point of putting the Hulk in the film, but as a way to call more fanboys and sell more tickets, if the Hulk were not in the movie, this movie would make a smaller box-office and less money would went into Disney's account. Not to mention the big wolf, like the hulk, is a computer-made digital doll. The effects that should have been the decoy of the film are amateurs and lousy. Everything in this film fails. In other words, this movie as blockbuster fails to show grandiose special effects and action scenes, the movie fails at all levels. Look, I hate Avatar, but James Cameron knows how to make a great visual spectacle with great action scenes, a beautiful but empty movie. Thor 3 is rubbish at all levels, especially in its proposal (special effects and action scenes). And this for me this is the biggest sin of this movie, because this movie failed in all its objectives.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"Ugly, badly paced, thinly written, tonally uneven and worst of all: unfunny, despite its desperate attempts.","Disorienting, loud and ugly, often all at the same time, Thor: Ragnarok boasts a cast of great Marvel characters and rich mythological storytelling--but squanders its potential by being nothing more than a paint by numbers action/comedy with a tone stuck somewhere between a Michael Bay film and a bad SNL skit. What makes it worse is that every attempt at comedy fails completely, and either kills the tension (not that there is much in the first place) or distracts from the plot.The plot is thin and glossed over, and the characters... there are none. Every character in this film is doing roughly the same thing-- a bit. A comedy bit to make the audience laugh. There is no real depth or humanity to this film, just jokes and bad CGI held together with more jokes. Awful choreography and sound design and basically no camera work at all, the film is shot like its a Clerks movie and is very bland to watch.I hope director Taika Waititi keeps away from blockbusters in the future--if only to save himself from anymore embarrassment. The already weak Thor trilogy ends on its lowest low.How Marvel has fallen.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Worst piece of cinema trash I've seen in awhile,"So this movie has an 8.2 on IMDb right now. If this movie would be listed as ""superhero parody"", then I would give it a 7. But this is not supposed to be a parody, it's supposed to be an action movie, with a script that makes some sense, with characters that should be a little believable.Nothing makes sense in this movie. Characters are complete trash - the movie revolves around goofy humor lines. I do admit that some of the jokes are good, but the whole movie itself is a joke. It almost breaks the 4th wall with out-of-universe jokes.I have seen some bad movies before, but this is the first time I walked out of the cinema in the middle of the movie (1 hour in).So people are trashing Batman v Superman because of some plot holes and gory visuals, but they applaud this as a masterpiece.

Don't listen or judge by the high rating from others, you will be disappointed if you don't know what you are going to watch!",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Another Marvel abomination,"If you want to make a movie like this take the following items and mix them together:1- A long piece of a wrestling TV show 2- Several clips taken from Flash Gordon (the 80's version) 3- A long piece of Thor (the first installment) but without all of the kitsch (only 25 % of that is enough to vomit) 4- A Rhianna video clip 5- A movie trailer from Narnia 6- Several pieces of different really bad historical movies from the 50's (Cleopatra, all those kind of things) so you can show a sufficient amount of ridiculous sets. 7- A clip from Battlestar Galactica 8- Whatever other garbage you can getThen take the mix and pour it into a waste disposal tank of an airplane after a long transatlantic trip. The resulting mix will be something similar.And thanks once again to Hollywood for flushing norse mythology down the toilet.Greetings from Scandinavia!",1
Thor: Ragnarok,was this suppose to be a comedy?,I dislike the movie because I was expecting it to be more serious. I don't understand why they had to make it look as if it was comedy movie (it wasn't fun at all). Every time that they talked seriously and something important was suppose to happened they tried to make a joke out of it. I hated that.122 out of 237 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Thor: Ragnarok,Why does anyone give this movie a good review?????,This was truly awful!!! It looked like the actors were free to make up their own dialogue. Every single scene is made to be a comedy but the humour is sadly lacking in at least 90% of it. Marvel have latched on to the comedy plaudits they receives from the first guardians of the galaxy movie and now every movie they make has to be hilarious. The action was horrible. Just a horrible backward step for comic book movies. Devastated I spent money to go and see it.83 out of 157 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Thor: Ragnarok,The Batman Forever of the MCU,"I was super excited for this movie. I love Thor in the comics. I love Hemsworth as Thor. Brannagh's take on the characters in the first film was appropriate. Watiti's take is just wrong. Did you see those skits he did after Civil War saying that Thor was in AUS waiting for someone to call him? He turned that Thor into a movie. Thor is a silly, twit. I loved the music. I even accept the story, though they really bastardized a lot of the comic book mythos, which I expect anymore. There was a great, deep story to be told here that was ruined by inappropriate humor. Now disclaimer: I don't enjoy the humor that is so popular in a lot of NZ and AUS material, so this movie was not for me. If you like simple jokes and bright flashy action with underused and somewhat pointless characters, then this could be for you. My expectations were at a higher bar and it failed.137 out of 269 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,A Total Disaster and here are the Details so Spoiler Alert,"EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THOR : RAGNAROKThe Movie was a total waste of time, the Hulk was shown to be with a child's mentality getting upset and doing children's moves. No explanation was given as to how the quinjet ended up on Sakkar, Age of Ultron in the time line comes after Thor the Dark World so even the explanation that he drifted into a spacetime bridge due to the conversion phenomenon is out of the question. The Hulk is Talking and no explanation is given for that he seems not angry anymore so why is he in Hulk mode in the first place.The second Stupid thing that the Marvel People didn't Even Bother to check was that in Thor the first movie Loki opened the Bifrost with the staff of ODEN (you can check the scene if you don't believe me) So how in HELL did Hela miss that knowing that she might be as ancient as Odin himself, not even once did she witness him open the Bifrost with his Staff?? They went to conquer the nine realms together so not knowing that is totally DUMB, if Loki knows it Hela should know it too.Before Loki screams ""BRING US BACK"" Thor say ""NO"" as if Hela couldn't reach Asgard without the Bifrost....? She appeared from HEL her Dimension into Midgard Earth without any Help why would she need the Bifrost to get There??? And if She so desperately needed the Bifrost for her conquest for the sake of argument she should have taken the sword the minute she landed on Asgard.AND How come the Devils ANUS gets you Directly to Asgard?? and if it does every time shouldn't the Grand Master know about it ? He seems not knowing what Asgard even is while his brother deals with Asgardians ??The Zombie Army is Stupid, they are slow, they are killable by simple asgardian citizens, what kind of an army is that?? Hela could conquer an entire planet by herself why would she need the dead weight.If Hela can't escape her Exile why did Odin send the Valkeries to finish her off in the first place ""knowing how powerful she is"" that was a dumb move on Odin's side. And we still don't know if Hela is bound to Exile because Odin is holding her off or how precisely because as mentioned before she can travel through dimensions at will. And if that's the case then she should be able to escape when Odin is weakened... say when he falls into the Odin sleep..?How did Odin abandon his responsibility as Protector of the nine realms and just went to Norway to enjoy the view is completely IDIOTIC and when confronted by his sons he just says ""it's your time now"" and vanishes?? He isn't injured, He is still capable of doing wonders but no he chose to turn into golden dust... That's pretty helpful thanks Odin.This movie went out of the frame that the fans and the Marvel Studios agreed upon, We expect action, a coherent story and good visual effects, if one of these elements is missing the movie sucks and frankly you should fire the scenario writers who put together Ragnarok because it's the Stupidest Movie Marvel Has Ever Made.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Awful just plain awful...wanted to walk out,For the life of me i cannot understand how every Marvel flick just hits it off with the critics just because of the lame one liners and forced jokes. If thats what you look for in a movie then you should watch a Jim Carrey flick from the 90's which would be way better. I just sat there wondering when the movie would get even a bit serious. I mean the protagonist loses some very close people to him and his whole world but hey instead of showing some emotion why not just throw in some more lame one liners and jokes. I could hear crickets in the cinema. The few people who laughed were forcing themselves i think lol.It was utter garbage. On the other hand Justice league even though it had its faults was pure awesome. At least they got the characters right instead of the more joke better review formula Marvel has adopted. Thor is not even close to its source comic material. And don't get me started on the awful CGI. Don't waste your money....,1
Thor: Ragnarok,Where is Marvel heading to?,"The movie was a big disappointment, looked like it was only constructed for the jokes (some good, some not that). Big plot holes like Sif not even being mentioned, or favorite secondaries like Volstagg and Fandral being discarded in an unworthy fashion. Why is Hogun leading the Asgard army when he was disbanded by Thor in the second movie to remain in his home-world? Why is Heimdall suddenly a traitor to the crown? Why does Odin pass away (as expected) so seamlessly and without a worthy scene like Frigga's? Oh, i get it, all of this was done to be unpredictable, right?Well... leaving aside that if you carefully watch the trailer, you know the entire movie in advance, the movie was very predictable.Big thumbs down Marvel for setting this tone, and an even bigger thumbs down to all those publication who call Thor 3 a work of awesomeness filled awesome art.I gave it a 1, because there are more than 10 marvel movies out there, and this was the worst of them.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"I hated this movie completely, and it should have been a Guardians of the Galaxy movie instead.","Ugh, I really really hated this movie entirely. I was hoping for the heart of Wonder Woman or Lord of the Rings in Epic Quality, I got none of that. I honestly wanted to leave the theater, and mind you that is quite a feat to get me to not want to watch a film anymore. Last movie to hold this distinction of me wanting to leave the theater was that awful live action Scooby Doo movie. I was not wanting to see a comedy but an epic, Shakespearian Drama with realistic humor in small quantities in it like the first one was. I got none of that as well. The only thing I did like was Cate Blanchett as Hela. What bothered me the most was that people were getting killed and maimed by Hela but golly gee! Let's crack another childish joke!!!! Imagine if Game of Thrones was a juvenile comedy like this movie? Thank the Old Gods and the New that GOT is realistic in it's character portrayals. When all is said and done I am just not going to watch another Marvel movie in the theater again. I should have trusted my instinct and not gone like I did with Thor: The Dark World, but I stayed for my mother and that's all. If DC betrays me with Justice League I'm just swearing off modern comic movies altogether and just relying on all my old DVDs of the great Comic movies like the first 2 Raimi Spider-mans, Nolan's Batman movies and X2 to remind me when Comic Movies actually had heart, not the Chaching of the cash register. I felt like Ragnarok completely insulted my intelligence. I grew up with the Christoppher Reeves Superman, I still love the first two Raimi Spidey movies, and the first two X-Men movies as well as Nolan's Batman movies. All of these franchises had quality, intelligence and heart, not treated as a comedy to appeal to the stoner generation and their simple minds. Marvel has let me down and I refuse to waste my money and two hours of my life on unenjoyable experiences anymore so I refuse to go see another Marvel film in theaters.P.S. And here's the spoiler, can someone please tell me exactly why they unnecessarily made Hela Odin's daughter and not Loki's Daughter from the past as in the continuity that has been around for decades? Did they not think that people could wrap their heads around the fact that Loki, most likely in his moment of freedom from Asgard between Thor and Avengers, time traveled and impregnated Hela's mother in the past?",1
Thor: Ragnarok,What did I just watch?!,"We've clearly hit an era in Hollywood where critics are totally at odds with the general public -and with good taste- with regards to latest blockbusters.From the opening scene, I could tell the comedic tone and the addition of swear-words was a result of Deadpool's success, but unlike Deadpool, the ""humour"" on display here felt more like an insult directed at the viewer.The horrendous art-style, lifted straight out of 1980's Flash Gordon, was also a slap in the face to the viewer. It's like the director was quite openly laughing at how bad he could make this look and still get away with it because it was super-camp.Then we had the usual feminist incursions, with the lead female villain literally crushing Thor's hammer in her hand (only a hand-full of characters can actually lift the hammer, never mind pulverising it!). And we have a female side-character apparently so strong and cool that Thor is humiliated and made to look puny on a regular basis by her. She's also infinitely stronger than the Hulk who at one point gets knocked to the floor by her... then symbolically stepped on then walked over!I could go on, but this movie already robbed me of 2hrs, so I'll simply finish by saying this is right up there with the very worst movies I've ever seen. This is what happens when communism creeps into entertainment.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,"As a longtime Marvel fan, I can't help but wonder WHAT they were thinking","Pros: Chris Hemsworth is great, finally allowed to be the star of his franchise. His performance brings a sense of continuity to the trilogy that otherwise wouldn't be there. The film also has truly hilarious moments, the best of which take place in the Hulk/Thor Gladiator fight.Cons: Everything else. The writing is TERRIBLE. Hela is probably the weakest villain the MCU has ever put out, right up there with Malekith and Ronan. There is no character development and the plot only exists as a joke telling mechanism. The whole film feels like a series of SNL skits that someone tried and failed to link together in a feature film. The action sequences are also deeply disappointing, amounting to nothing more than visual noise.I don't understand how anyone has been able to praise the storytelling in this film. After thinking about it a lot, I can only assume that it's the concept of the film that is being praised, the entire idea of combining Thor: Ragnarok with Planet Hulk and using Hela as the villain in a Thor/Banner buddy cop movie. And I completely agree that this plot is great ‚Äî it's what had me so excited for this movie.However, the way it is delivered is awful. A basic concept in writing is show, don't tell (i.e. it's better to show your audience that someone is nervous than simply say ""He was nervous""). But from the very beginning, this movie tells the audience everything, spoon feeding us enough of a plot to keep the movie advancing in order to tell more jokes. Every big plot point is told to the audience and then never developed. For instance, the film's big twist is that Hela is Thor's sister. Odin tells us that in the very beginning of the movie and then¬Ö nothing. It is never developed. We never feel that familial relationship between Hela, Thor and Loki. Compare that to the excellent way that Thor and The Avengers developed Thor and Loki's brotherly bond. It's a definitive attribute of their characters. However, if Hela hadn't been their sister, the movie would have unfolded exactly the same way, it made literally no difference to the film/characters. And there are so many unanswered questions. Was Frigga Hela's mother, or someone else? Would Frigga be okay with Odin locking their daughter away? Ultimately, it was such a random plot point at such a late stage in the Thor mythology and it never ended up paying off or connecting to anything else in the story.And then there's what this movie does to the Hulk. I could rant for a very long time about this, so I will just leave it at this: Ruffalo's Banner/Hulk under the direction of Joss Whedon has consistently been one of the best characters in the MCU. Both Banner and the Hulk have been used to great effect, showing that they can be both heartbreaking or hilarious in the very same movie. This film's shallow, oversimplified version has NONE of what has made the character so amazing in previous films and I find myself worrying that they've actually ruined the character. No, I don't hate that he talks. He's talked before and it's the natural progression of his character to become more intelligent/aware. But the way that they decided to execute this character progression, all in the name of comedy rather than character development, was terrible.The action sequences were awful as well. The MCU has shown through properties like Winter Soldier, The Avengers, and Daredevil that they can produce creative action sequences that are unique in tone, execution, or narrative. This movie did none of that. The action was CGI heavy and indistinct. In Daredevil or a Russo Brother's movie, I can feel every punch that is thrown. In this movie it was an unoriginal mess of visual noise that lacked any sense of scale. Every battle sequence, but especially the final one, fell extremely flat. I also thought a lot of the CGI and green screens were really evident, giving the movie a fake quality. However, this could have been purposeful to mimic the 80's feel the movie was striving for, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt on that one.My final complaint is one I never expected to have. Two Marvel properties came out in November, The Punisher and Thor: Ragnarok. One of those movies featured gratuitous violence and tried to get the audience to laugh at grotesque images. It wasn't The Punisher. Yes, of course The Punisher was far more graphic and emotionally disturbing, but that is for the sake of developing the character and story and dealing with important issues. Thor: Ragnarok featured several scenes that were just so strange in their violence that they literally took me out of the movie. The first was the introduction of Valkyrie, in which she murders a group of people, literally reducing them to dust, without giving them a warning or chance to run. My jaw dropped and I heard someone in front of me say ""Wow, they're going there?"" Yet, unlike many other violent Marvel properties, we were never supposed to question if this made Valkyrie a hero or a villain. The next scene that stood out was the prolonged shot of Bruce Banner's shattered, grotesque body on the rainbow bridge. The shot was meant to and succeeded in earning laughs, reducing Banner's uncertain fate to a joke. Certain movies, such as Deadpool, demand these kinds of creative choices to do justice to the character's world and experience. Thor was never one of these characters.As someone who LOVES Marvel, this was the first time I've walked away from an MCU movie feeling completely disappointed. This film didn't seem to respect itself, let alone the rest of the MCU or the people who love these stories. I only hope it won't damage the MCU moving forward.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Biggest disappointment ever,"If I wanted (which I DON'T) to see a movie with clowns, I would go to one. I am sorry I didn't read the reviews, I would have a hint... Anyway, transforming Thor in a goofy clown, and all the lousy jokes in an apparently serious situation (Asgard in danger, etc...) made me sorry for the money I paid for the ticket. I didn't want a lousy comedy, I wanted a Thor sequel, and I got a stew made from old Thor recipe plus goofy jokes - apparently they wanted to touch all possible segments of audience - they could include some porn and some vampires and they would have everything. I hope the actors got some fat paychecks, as a consolation for degrading themselves for playing in this one.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Not good movie,"I'm so so disappointed from this movie, ridiculous Thor - Hulk - Loki. why why so ridiculous humiliation movie why? why? That movie is serious movie not movie for fun, who want to see a movie with a fun can choose a comedy movie not that movie... THOR... OMG guys come on fix a good serious movie with the Marvel..... How can i see now the Avengers 3 how?? how gonna be that movie? ridiculous movie, if i want to see a movie with a fun, i gonna choose a comedy movie to see, not that movie ''THOR''... that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life... I'm not gonna spent my money again for that movies at cinema.... Sorry Guys you disappointed me so much....",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Big disappointment!,"This comment comes from a person who likes superhero movies!Thank you for ruining my favorite superhero! The movie is bullshit, the whole scenario is bullshit and you made the pussy out of Thor, the pussy without a hair and an eye!! I didn't read the comics so I don't know is this something according to the comics but honestly, I don't care all I know is that I've loved Marvel so far, the key word ""so far""!This is a lame excuse for a superhero movies. I like Marvel jokes but this is just too, too, tooo much, like every few seconds and good scenes are ruined with them not to mention unnecessary, stupid (""funny"") conversations of main or other characters.In my opinion DC will crash Marvel and after this kind of movie it should!!Thank God Justice League is only a week away so I could watch the REAL SUPERHERO MOVIE!",1
Thor: Ragnarok,One of a Kind,"If we judge the quality of Marvel movies regarding pure entertainment, Ragnarok is easily one of the best Marvel movie yet. It is filled with Laugh Out Loud moments and stuffed with emotions. This movie also solves the villain problems of Marvel, all thanks to the brilliant performance by Cate Blanchett. This is probably best portrayal from Chris Hemsworth yet after his movie Rush. One of the biggest positives of the movie is it has the right amount of known/beloved characters and new/exciting characters. However, as a negative aspect of this movie, I would say this is the most Marvelish movie yet. They treat everything as an opportunity for a goof. However, thanks to the chemistry between Hulk-Thor-Loki, it will be a stand-out movie in the highly crowded MCU. To sum it up this movie was a riot from start to finish. Audiences are going to love this movie. I hope it sustains its run when Justice League drops in the theaters.47 out of 87 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"I thought guardians of the galaxy sucked, but it was nothing compared to this garbage","For starters the movie had a million plot holes, all the characters acted like they were mentally ill. Thors friends all died and no one even mention anything about it, not even a one second pause? The Hulk was a joke and Loki acted like a puss the whole movie (From a smart psycho that everyone was afraid of to a stupid puss who did nothing the whole movie).And what about those buttons that stunned them, why not put one of those on Hela?WHAT WAS THIS MOVIE?!",1
Thor: Ragnarok,The second worst MCU movie until now,"So badly, Ragnarok is not only a threat to Asgard, but also to the entire Marvel Cinematographic Universe (MCU). If the next Avengers (Infinity War) movie follows the same line we may have the end of these franchise much sooner than we expected... Of the nearly 20 MCU films so far, only the Hulk solo movie has managed to be worse than this one. There is no exciting moment in the movie, the soundtrack is very weak, the performances are weak, the characters are two-dimensional, the script is weak and the list goes on. Some of the main characters in the two other Thor films simply disappeared as if they had never existed and others had irrelevant roles. The only characters from the other two movies with relevant roles in this one are Thor himself and Loki, but with totally altered personalities. The two were transformed into clowns. Clearly it's just a comedy movie with action scenes, but it's not even funny to watch. The background story is tragic and does not match with the slapstick comedy they tried to do. Okay, they tried to copy Guardians of the Galaxy (GG), but it did NOT work. GG is genuinely funny and has its exciting/sentimental moments. In Ragnarok there are bland jokes even in the most dramatic moments. Nothing against comedy. The original Avengers movie itself had very funny scenes, but at the same time it reconciled it with moments of seriousness and emotion. Ragnarok looks more like a parody of Thor than a Marvel movie. The film script looks more like a Swiss cheese, with so many holes. Now I will describe some of these plot holes, which can be considered a SPOILER, but I do not advise anyone to waste time watching this movie anyway... I also advise nobody to bring children to watch this movie, because there are death scenes that are treated as comedy and in one of the very few serious scenes in the movie in which a character dies impaled, I heard a six years old boy laughing. Thor's two previous films were not brilliant, but they were competent in portraying the characters and their fictional universe and extremely better as a movie than this fiasco. Now the 21 worst holes in the movie: 1 - Lady Sif, one of the main characters of the other two films is not even mentioned. 2 - Why does Thor, along with Hulk and several other allies give up Hela without practically trying? Thor's extreme and desperate attitude is totally improbable ... Having Hulk an impenetrable skin, it is hard to believe that Hela's strange power to materialize blades would be able to defeat him. 3 - Asgard, a whole planet, seems to have little more than 500 inhabitants and all living in the same city! 4 - Thor does not care or comment on the death of his three best friends. 5 - Thor doesn't care about the destruction of his entire planet. Even other inhabitants living outside that city and the nature. As if he had lived hundreds of years in one place and had no regard for anything. 6. How do everyone on earth know of the details of the relationship between Thor and Jane? Has Thor a Facebook account of public figure?!? 7 - Relationally with Jane is discarded with just one comic phrase, making the previous films ridiculous and meaningless. 8 - Why did you spend money hiring Matt Damon and Sam Neil for ridiculous roles? Was it supposed to be funny? 9 - Why did Valkyrie keep - for THOUSANDS of years - a grievance of Asgard? 10 - Why does Valkyrie suddenly, after these THOUSANDS of years - change her mind and help Thor by risking his own life? 12 - Why is Valkyrie's alcoholism treated as a joke and the same theme banned in another MCU movie? 13 - How Valkyrie, being thousand years older than Thor, does not appear to be older than him? 14 - How does Banner die and rise again? In the original Avengers movie, it is explained that the transformation in Hulk takes place to avoid the Banner's death, which was great, but not that he is able to resurrect Banner after dead. The scene was made like this just to be funny, but it was non sense like almost everything in the movie. 15 - How is Thor slain by Hulk and does not show a scratch? 16 - Loki takes power in Asgard just to make some jokes and eat fruit, wasting a comedy scene on a plot that had been crafted for years by at least three movies (Thor 1 and 2 and The Avengers). 17 - On the planet Hulk, in the arena fight, Thor gets all electrified, but that does not overload the shock disk circuit on his neck. 18 - Incidentally for someone who gets all electrified, having a shock disk as the main weakness is just another plot hole ... ""Like Odin, did you know that Thor and Loki were coming?"" 19 - How does Hela appear from nothing after Odin's death? 20 - How was Hela so powerful early in the movie being so far from Asgard - her source of power? 21- In a scene that a man is melted and the only reaction of Thor is of disgust in a comic scene, which does not match at all with the character and ends up aggravating the trivialization of death that is the tonic of the attempt of comedy in the entire movie.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Wannabe Guardians of the Galaxy,"This was terrible it felt like a GotG knock-off. The ""jokes"" weren't funny and felt forced.

It's a shame that the audience just buy that crap and swallow it.The only 2 redeeming things this movie had are: 1: The exploration of the valkyries i wish there was more of that in the movie. 2: The exploration of the how asgard came to be which i also wished there was more of that.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Why do I want to see Loki again???,I never understood why they made Loki the main villain in the first Avengers film. He wasn't scary and didn't even die in the end. To date he's been the villain in around 4 Marvel movies and all the time the heroes think Loki will be on their side and guess what? He ends up tricking them and somehow gets away. I mean there aren't any variations to his character to provide something different. It's just the same character villain again and again. Tom Huddleston is a boring actor. I hate his soft spoken voice. He thinks he's doing Shakespeare.And why are they making a Thor movie look like a Custodians of the Cosmos (i.e. Guardians of the Galaxy) movie? The Thor movies had a Viking vibe to them which I liked. Also severe under usage of Heimdall. I'm not running to the theaters for this one.29 out of 58 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Thor: Ragnarok,If Marvel Studios did a 3 stooges movie ... this is it.,"This has got to be the worse, most disjointed Marvel movie to date. From the sublime, to the ridiculous, that kinda sums this up. Other Marvel movies have the odd one liner, like Thor's, ""He's adopted"" from the Avengers, and they where so slight, and infrequent, that the pace of the movie was never affected. Not so here, comedy, it would seem is the most important thing in this movie, and some of the jokes make the universe's mightiest heroes, appear like they are 8 year old, it really is that slapstick, the pacing of the movie dies because of it, at no point was I gripped on the edge of my seat at the action, because it was always broken up by ""Who's on first base"" comedy. The director took a gamble here, and some love it, I think it's awful, it's like Al Pacino doing comedy, it's. just. wrong. The eye candy and effects are all there, and Hella is played in a wonderful deadpan style. But the script is so full of dad jokes, it's hard for the rest of the cast get a real grip of the part they are playing, Heimdall is here, although has lost some of his gravitas that made him Heimdall, and Loki just full of .... nonsense, even by his standards.I sincerely hope the rest of the offerings from Marvel studios are better than this tripe.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Juvenile garbage at its worst,"Save over two hours of your life by not watching this. If you enjoyed the first two films, and I certainly did, end your journey here because this awful film destroys the character entirely.
If the film had been played straight it might have managed it, but only might. It is the script that is the real villain of the piece, and if there is any justice at all, the script writer should have his keyboard shoved where the sun doesn't shine.
Marvel have decimated Spiderman, and now Thor. I have no idea what they are doing, but I am likely to stop watching soon if they don't get back on track.
This film is toe-curlingly awful, on a par, if not actually outdoing, The Amazing Spiderman 2.
I'm actually angry that it's so bad.12 out of 21 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Hot Garbage Would Be Generous,"Imagine a movie where the actors lazily spoke lines and joked every 3 seconds. Well get ready for lame, lame lame! This movie was so bad, I contemplated leaving after the first 15 minutes. Instead I read IMDb reviews should have do this prior. Thor Ragnarok is more predictable than a Donald Trump impeachment. I wasted 2 hours sitting through a god awful impromptu play that will torment right-thinking individuals. Can only pray JLA restores my faith. MCU stole my hard earned money. Don't get robbed.

Thor: Ragnarok,Unbelievable Spectacle of Ruin to the Thor Franchise,"This is clearly the case of Walt Disney Pictures cashing in on a once very good Marvel franchise.My Wife and I were in total disbelief when we started watching Thor: Ragnarok. We watched for about 30 minutes and then couldn't take it any longer and left the theater.So so sad that they made a joke of and totally disrespected the the Thor character and all that it had become.Also, I cannot believe that this film is getting such good reviews. There must be some conspiracy going on that I'm not apart of, or everyone has become so numb to what a well constructed film should be like.One more beef and I'm done. One of the all time great actors, Anthony Hopkins, is totally disrespected in the sad and uneventful death of his character Odin. REALLY!",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"This movie is painfully awful, even for a Marvel film.","I was never a huge fan of the Thor movies, quite frankly I'm actually not a huge fan of the Marvel movies. Some are okay, while others are just complete and utter garbage.When I watch a Marvel movie, it's quite easy to know what to expect: stimulating action sequences, special effects, and an easy-to-follow story line. Basically, these movies are aimed towards a mass audience. The majority of the audience however is made up of 13-year-olds, while also making it JUST ""cool"" enough to appeal to maybe their parents or older siblings.You start to think, ""Okay, you know what, these movies aren't so bad. I could watch one of these once in awhile. They're fun, they're easy, and they're enjoyable on some levels."" That's pretty much where Marvel movies stand with me.Anyway, back to Thor. I've always liked Thor over a lot of other Marvel movies because it was more serious. The Thor universe is that of Viking Norse myth legend and resembled that olden time of swords and shields and things. I'm a huge fan of fantasy so that reciprocated well with me. The first two Thor movies were decent at best. I wasn't in awe when the credits rolled, I didn't tell all my friends about it - but it was a decent watch, a good way to kill some time. It wasn't my desired movie experience by any means. Then again, I know what to expect when I watch a Marvel movie so movies like that have become sort of like a break for me from other movies that I try to watch.So I put on Thor: Ragnarok, hoping to get that fun, easy, pretty cool movie... And I came to find out that this movie is a steaming pile of hot garbage.What a complete turn in the wrong direction for the Marvel franchise and especially for the character of Thor, and the Hulk for that matter. Since when was Thor witty? Since when did the Hulk talk like a f**king baby rather than a pissed off green giant that's too big for his own good? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE?Let's name some other things wrong with this movie...""Hey, Thor fans, remember everything vital to the storyline of Thor 1 and 2? You do? Okay, well just forget all of that because Thor has a sister! Yeah, he has a sister and Asgard actually became as prestigious and powerful because of her doing. Yup, yup... I know, it's f**king stupid but just roll with it okay?""Yeah... also, everyone BESIDES Thor and Loki knew about their sister, Hela.More things wrong with this movie...
The music is bad. When Thor and Loki go to Earth, nobody notices them, ESPECIALLY LOKI WHO TRIED TO DESTROY THE EARTH (good job creating a Marvel universe). Everything involving Hela doesn't even matter in the end because Surtur destroys everything anyway. The planet Thor and Loki land on is like fruity Mad Max/John Carter land and isn't in the slightest bit interesting or has any character to it besides the fact that it's filled with garbage and there's a gladiator stadium. Characters like Korg and Miek actually mean nothing besides plans for the future in this s**tty franchise. Thor is restrained by the Grandmaster by a piece of metal in his neck that jolts him with electricity...""Wait what? You're telling me that THE GOD OF THUNDER, who has lightning going through his veins is suppressed by a tiny jolt of electricity in his neck?""Yeah... this movie is trash. I could sit here for hours telling you the things wrong with this movie and how bad the CGI is but I'll just wrap this up by saying this movie is painfully awful and you shouldn't waste your time sitting through it. When the movie is trying to be funny, it's not. Holy s**t is it not funny. However, when the movie is trying to be serious, it's hilarious.I'm so done with the Thor franchise. Seriously, how many times is Loki going to try to betray Thor and just get forgiven for it?The amount of positive reviews for this film is actually disgusting. If this is the direction Marvel is heading, I'm actually scared to see what comes next.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"Boring, predictable and just a waste of time","If you're 15 years old or younger, you'll enjoy this movie. If you're older, educated and have a brain, you'll know after 5 minutes of watching this it's going to be a waste of time.Completely predictable. Nothing new to see here......at all.Continuous barrage of lame jokes that a 15 year old might enjoy, but not someone with a functioning brain. Insulting to anyone with an IQ of 70 or higher.This is basically a cash grab for the Marvel movies. They would have done better having never made such rubbish. On par with DC's Justice League.13 out of 25 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"Yes, critics are sold to Disney/Marvel","Epic insult to Thor as a character and his whole universe. Absolute trash of a movie. Enough has been said about the endless teenager jokes preventing any sense of seriousness at any moment. The script is as hollow as space.If you ever wanted to see a superhero movie without a vilain, this is one. Hela has like 5 minutes on screen over this 130 minutes comedy show. Her minutes are not that interesting as her character's mimics are almost grotesque.Loki has been turned into the funny idiot for (more) comic relief. He's just a God after all but gets beaten up by some 5'2'' Valkyrie. He takes the hits and almost apologizes for being there. This is the God of Mischief here and you would expect to feel some cause for concern when he's around, but Disney/Marvel and their paid critics have decided that this was not an issue at all.And that Valkyrie... this has to be the most annoying character created by Hollywood since Jar Jar Binks. She's about 5'2'' but can punch guys like Arnold did in the 80's. Oh and they had to make her drink like a guy too. So yes, another superhero female character introduced in a movie with no other point than being a female superhero. Each movie has hers now, it seems like a rule. Yes we know, politics want movies to balance out against all that maleness of the past and push the idea that females can save humankind. Btw, did you ever thought about the fact that the strongest man in the world can probably toss around and punch away average guys? While the strongest female in the world can't because of PHYSICS? By bowing to politics, these idiots in the studios have removed physics from action movies. STOP IT. YOU ARE KILLING MOVIES.I'll stop there. Avoid this crap. If you are unlucky enough to see it and you are not sure you liked it or not because after all, all the critics said it was good and maybe you missed something, remember at that point that no, you did not miss anything, it was BAD and designed for very immature audiences. People over 18 who think this movie was good should be removed their right to vote at elections.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Weakest MCU Movie so far.,"A little goofiness is OK. But Thor has too much of it. Was expecting an Epic, Action filled, dramatic Thor film, not a silly space comedy. And it ain't that funny also. Not like Guardians or even Ant Man. Those are funny and well made. This one is a train wreck. The weakest movie of the MCU so far. It's a bad joke. The characters had so much potential, but everything was wrong. Bad acting, Bad jokes, Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum being certainly the worst. Odin's scenes were horrendous. What a mess. No emotions, no story background. Feels like a rushed product, made by a cinema first year student. The previous Thor movies were so majestic and dramatic. This one looks like a bad B movie with great CGI. No serious Thor or Marvel fan will think this movie is good or fun. So Disappointed. Waste of money. Awful.14 out of 28 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Superheroes Have Become Stand Up Comedians Since Disney took Over Marvel,"What a joke (pun intended). As if the Mary Sues, gender switches and plot holes were not enough Disney has made Thor and others instruments of comedy and the low IQ masses and preteens 9or those with preteen brains) are lapping it up.In other words, according to Disney and its groupies, Adam Sandler is a super hero (stupid, moronic, lowbrow and juvenile comic).In Ragnarok Thor doesn't even know which god he is. This is as far away from Thor, Norse mythology and super heroes as Trump is to class and sanity.7 out of 12 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,is this a movie?,"No this is not a movie. Oversimplistic plot, zero character development, zero acting.
Why did they bring all this great actors? for nothing! Why did they need oscars' Kate Blanchett for a superficial villain who just kills a few people? What did the presence of Matt Damon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Karl Urban added to the movie? Nothing! A few scenes, a few lines to make a couple of jokes and that's it. Idris Elba could bring some dramatic effect, but no. I can go like that for the rest.Yes some images are beautiful (although much less than previous movie, the pair Thor - Loki had some nice opportunities, but even them seemed too fake, too one-liners, too child acting. Even when delivering some 1st grade jokes they did it so badly.Marvel continues its own Ragnarok. Maybe they target the youngest audience in purpose to ensure future gains, or the silliest. Just look at the positive reviews, they either venerate Marvel as a perfect God, or their reviews are similar to the movie's cheesy lines on simplistic arguments.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,The MCU film that broke me,"It's been a long road for me these past 10 years, keeping up with all these random MCU films for better or worse. With such a diverse set of characters, concepts, and settings, I guess it was always inevitable that this would be a franchise where the movies would either be great, terrible, or somewhere in between. Personally, my favorite has always been the first Thor film. My least favorite has always been Guardians of the Galaxy. In other words, I'm clearly in a specific minority in the MCU's audience. All the same, regardless of the film or its quality, I felt I could always take consolation in one thing: that I would always love Chris Hemsworth as Thor and that I could always count on him to just be the good old-fashioned God of Thunder that I knew and loved.How wrong I was. That cozy myth was completely shattered for me after watching Thor: Ragnarok. I had always known in the back of my mind that there were a number of tiny little things about the MCU and its overall execution that bothered me, but this was a film that took all those flaws, made them exponentially larger and more noticeable, and placed them on a big, shiny pedestal for everyone to see. At first, my biggest concern for the MCU was that all of its future standalone hero films would just be wastes of time like Antman or Dr. Strange; in other words, mindless clones of the first Iron Man. Ragnarok, of course, has given me a bigger concern: that sooner or later, all of these films, regardless of their type, will just be mindless clones of Guardians and all the protagonists will just be red-clad quip machines like Tony Stark, Peter Quell, Antman, Dr. Strange, Spiderman, etc.. Can't a guy say he's had enough?As biased as I may be, I still feel that Ragnarok, even on the technical level, is a flat-out terrible film. Besides the fact a dead serious warrior demigod clearly wouldn't completely change his personality overnight to that of a guffawing, blonde-haired Jar Jar Binks for no reason, the movie suffers from a multitude of other problems as well. First off, objectively speaking, the events of the film include Thor's father dying, his three best friends getting killed, his hammer getting smashed to pieces, his right eye getting torn out, and his home-world getting blown to smithereens. Also objectively speaking, practically none of the characters ever acknowledge these events; they just drunkenly stagger from scene-to-scene, improvising idiotic, irrelevant dialogue, and generally trying way too hard to treat the movie like a comedy instead of an epic tragedy.Unfortunately, as Taika Waititi so painstakingly proves, you really can't make something this dark, terrible, and traumatizing into a comedy. The incessant stabs at cutesy or inappropriate humor at unfitting moments gets really old, really fast, especially when more than half of all these forced jokes involve either contrived slapstick or references to sex or genitalia. Arguably, the true tragedy here is a movie that's supposed to be a comedy, but didn't once make me laugh or smile during its two-hour runtime. All I could do was sit there staring at the screen, wondering if the movie was trying to be funny, serious, both, or neither?All the characters in a nutshell:Surtur-Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs as a towering devil creature. Surely his member is the biggest, most flaming one of them all, yet Thor makes no mention of it. Talk about a HUGE missed opportunity.
Hulk-While I do appreciate Hulk finally being a character for once (and not just a big green deus ex machina), why DOES the sight of his anatomy upset Thor so much? I get that you're ""trying to be funny"", Thor, but you've been all over the galaxy, you've seen far bigger, veinier things on bigger monsters multiple times; get over it.
The Grandmaster-Jeff Goldblum as himself in an MCU film... and he has an orgy ship... and a big portal in the sky of his world called ""the Devil's Anus"". Clever stuff.
Valkyrie-An apathetic, knife-wielding broad with a drinking problem. So... Tony Stark and Gamora rolled into one? Clever stuff.
Hela-A generically evil woman who somehow gets far less screen-time and character development than Jeff Goldblum... even though he's not the main enemy. Girl power!!
Scourge-Yet another vehicle for contrived jokes that adds shockingly little to the story. Are we really supposed to feel anything when he dies shooting a bunch of cgi skeletons in the face with a couple of assault rifles? Was that supposed to be funny too? I'm so confused.
Korg-The insensitive clod that makes fun of Asgard being blown to kingdom come while its once-proud people look on in sorrow. Yeah, this guy is SOOOOOOOOO funny.
Miek-Korg's simple-minded, cgi best friend. Unfortunately, the only thing he ever says is, ""I am Miek."" Spoiler alert: he dies at the end, but also miraculously survives.Having said that, there are plenty of other grievances I have with this film (like the main plot of Asgard's endangerment and the subplot of Planet Hulk literally having nothing to do with each other), but I think you get the idea. I wanted to see Thor going through this dark chapter in his life as exactly that-a dark chapter in his life. Instead, I got Chris Hemsworth skipping around everywhere and giggling like a little girl for two hours straight, falling over himself and talking about how he always wanted to be a woman... all while his family, friends, and homeland get torn to bloody shreds all around him.To Thor: Ragnarok, I give 1/10 stars for singlehandedly ruining Thor's character and, by extension, the entire MCU. I now understand how utterly pointless it is to pay attention to what exactly any of these characters are; sooner or later, they'll all devolve into uncreative, cackling zombie clones of Tony Stark and Peter Quell. And that's just not funny.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Not THOR this movie is a JOKE,"This movie looks like a cw series, full of jokes.

Thor: Ragnarok,A Watered Down Husk,"I really don't want to hate this movie.First of all, the characters personalities have been neutered, to the point where they're basically bad joke/self referential one liner vending machines.And I hate to use an overused joke considering the movie I'm reviewing, but...Take a shot of alcohol every time there's a joke that doesn't add to the plot or characters, try and make it through the first half, in fact, forget that, try and make through the first fifteen minutes, you'll be very drunk.Also, for a movie with such a colourful poster, why does the movie itself look so dull? Asgard in the first two movies looked so grand, and shiny.In this movie, while there's technically more colour, it feels more flat.It's like the cinematographer turned the brightness up to the absolute maximum, and the contrast down to the absolute minimum so instead of the colours standing out, the picture looks mostly white and grey.One of the more stranger things I felt with this movie, is that it feels like the filmmakers hate all the characters, except for maybe Heimdall.Thor and Loki are constantly falling over, getting hit in the head, and getting electrocuted, which in Thor's case doesn't make sense, since he can shoot lightening at the end.Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun are just killed off in their first scenes, and Thor doesn't even react or find out.Sif isn't even mentioned in this movie.Hela's the villain, so yeah I'm not surprised there.Valkyrie is just an alcoholic who kidnaps people for money, and yeah that's about all there is to her character, yeah the villain killed her wife but at the end when she's fighting Hela, she doesn't say, ""That was for my lover"" or anything related to that, that little bit of back story just felt pointless.Skurge, he basically has no character, he's just fed info by Hela, turns good again at the end, then dies.Bruce Banner, he's just here so the producers could put The Hulk on all the posters and in all of the trailers, other then that, he doesn't have a character ark, he just falls over a lot, gets hit in the head a bunch, and he says unfunny one liners, basically the same as Thor and Loki.And finally Odin, what really surprised me with this specifically, is how the writers added a bunch of backstory to Odin's character, to just ignore it.Basically Odin and Hela went around conquering and committing genocide on different worlds.You'd think being Odin's son, Thor might have some sort of emotional response to this, but just like with Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun, he doesn't even find out, so it's just as useless.And last of all here's a question I bet even people who like this movie can't answer, What is the theme/message of this movie?Because I can name the themes/messages for the first two movies just fine.The theme/message for Thor (2011) ""Killing people just for disagreeing with you, only creates enemies""The theme/message for Thor The Dark World ""Forcing your people to give up their lives for their land is no less brutal then mass genocide""The theme/message for Thor Ragnarok, after weeks of thinking ""Forcing people, to do things against their will is fine, as long it's the good guys who are forcing them""It's a shame when a series starts off by simply being, and doing its own thing.But then the producers start listening to the people who weren't even fans to begin with, and they turn it into an obnoxious, cynical, condescending, self parody, that I didn't walk out on, because I still like the MCU.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Terrible joke.,"This movie is littered with awful, stupid jokes. That itself is not sich a bad thing, but the fact that every scene, every somewhat serious moment leads up to a cheap gag just disappoints me.Thor isn't Thor anymore. He's not a brutal god from Asgard, he's a silly joker, a walking comedic relief. He acts like a simple guy from Earth, I can't see how he's still ""Thor"".You can't take ANYTHING in this movie seiously. Everything was made for gags.
Maybe you can laugh first 5-6 times, but then you just cringe every time this movie throws another stupid, awful, unfunny joke at you.Action scenes are mediocre, nothing extraordinary. Same with plot. The villain-girl was barely shown.Also, Thor (God of Thunder) gets knocked down with a shocker. Just think about this.Overall, just a bad movie. I never want to see it again.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Thor: Ragna.... zzzzzzzz,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie months back I had a bad feeling about it. In other words, something was telling me it was going to be a huge disappointment. That gut feeling was not wrong. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a poor attempt of superhero comedy, so poor infact that (like Spiderman: Homecoming) I couldn't bear to watch it all. I'm not sure why the writers decided to take it in the ""humorous"" (I use that term very loosely) direction that they did as all they achieved was to turn Thor into a parody of himself, totally ruining the character in the process. I just didn't get the need for all of the cheesy one-liners that peppered the film like cringe-worthy moments from a stand-up act gone wrong, it truly was unbearable after a while. As other people have said, the films events were supposed to have serious undercurrents but they were all delivered so carefree and joked about that there was very little for us as an audience to emotionally invest in, how can that be a good thing? I didn't care what happened to Thor, Asgard or anything, in fact I wanted everyone to die half hour into the film so I could do something more interesting like paint the fence. I have really been enjoying the MCU films for all these years up until the past two mentioned movies, they have just been plain awful and I really fear that Infinity War is going to go the same route. I hope to god it doesn't as, for me, it will just be a massive shame and a waste of such a good build up of 10 years' worth of excellent movies and story lines.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Ragna wrong,"Oh dear oh dear oh dear.Where to start?Well, Thor 1 and Thor 2 were great. Loved those films - as someone previously said - the humour had a place in those films. It was all referential to an individual in an unknown place and out of their depth - and most crucially it was Thor being a dufus and the rest of the world around him playing the 'straight man'.Now - since Guardians Of The Galaxy was 'apparently' so good - they've gone to town on the funnies, and the plot or any believable emotional response to any event in the film takes a distant back seat.The result is a boring, unenfaging film. Not to mention confusing.I'm writing this film as Thor is sitting down talking to the hulk about fire. That's a scene almost exactly half way through the film. I haven't seen 50% of this garbage film yet and i'm Already bored and writing a review. Wow. Hopefully it will save some else the ¬£9.99 Of wastes earnings buying it. Yes BUYING it. Marvel Studios don't even want to let me rent this utter trash.I could write more but the longer my review is, then the more of this film I have to watch.Forget Thor - in fact forget Marvel Studios, because they don't even understand their own films.Awful. 1 Star.

Thor: Ragnarok,Good comedy but another forgettable Thor movie,OK let me start by saying that the comedy in the movie is good.funny movie overall. But like GoTg 2 the humour overshadows the serious moments. It's more of a teenager flick where no one cares about the consequences and repercussions the characters are just goofy and joke their way through all the destruction. Thor is supposed to be serious seeing ragnarok OK taking place but jokes after jokes makes the whole movie want to fall apart.11 out of 24 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink,1
Thor: Ragnarok,An embarrassment...,"First I have to say that I am a massive fan of the marvel movie franchise, as well as a massive fan of Thor comics all the way back to Journey into Mystery 83, and indeed the first two Thor movies... So what happened?
Of course superhero movies are stuff and nonsense, but it works because the director and cast take it seriously. The same is true for comedy. If jokes are telegraphed, they don't work... and here we had two hours of hamming it up and mugging for the camera. For British fans we seem to have Carry on up the Fjord, or for those in the U.S., Lewis and Martin are back! Characters who previously had gravitas or indeed a personality become ciphers at best. I can only guess that the cast signed up before reading the script. On the other hand Director Taika Waititi must be congratulated for persuading really very fine actors to give truly poor performances.

Thor: Ragnarok,Ragnawhok ??,"Starting from the basics.What does the title mean?From Wikipedia: In Norse mythology, Ragnar√∂k is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, T√Ωr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. the fact that our film and characters are quite literally the same as those mentioned in the Norse mythology one would hope to see such cataclysmic disasters of monumental proportions on screen from ""The House of idea"" right?WRONG!!Well our characters have either gone fully insane or the performers were bound by contracts and buried under the pile of of cash that they didn't tried to borrow or adapt anything remotely from the source and that spelled Ragnarok (ironic in this case) for the film. The performances are trite and pathetic except for Hemsworth who showcases his natural talent of comic relief. He has proved time and again that he has the talent for what it takes to be a powerhouse and his boastful resume speaks of Rush,Thor, In the Heart of Sea, etc. But sadly the ""GOD of Thunder"" has been reduced to a self aware parody that only leads to ennui for the audience.This feels more like what the ""GOD of blunder"" would do.Mind you, this film is mostly targeted for children and teenage audience so humor, colorful C.G.I scenery which are glaringly obvious and plainly distracting in some cases in the film and retro infused soundtracks are enough on the platter to cater to them.Hulk's character is forced in the film as he doesn't feel natural midst all the chaos. Even his motion capture looks cheap as low budget corny effects.his struggling with his humanity and monstrosity sides has been sidelined and likely won't be addressed further as his presence in ANY film is just to have a bruiser to smash.Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie looks NOTHING like her comic counterpart since she should have been a tall musclebound warrior with sinewy physique not some glamour model walking the catwalk cos-playing her new Walmart sale.ODIN the all-father, one of the most powerful characters is conveniently sidestepped so as to circumvent his true potential like taking head on with Galactus the ""Devourer of Worlds"", taking a full on brunt from Silver surfer and Thanos and acting like nothing ever happened. But sadly Anthony Hopkins looks tired and bored to continue and even expressed disappointment regarding this very fact not once but twice!!Then why bother casting him in the first place??All in all a ""seen it all before"" repeating formulaic garbage from MCU. i don't understand how the director said in the first place this will be darker than all previous THOR movies. did i mention Karl urban was in it? Yes he was as forgettable as his character was that of a mindless grunt henchmen of Hela. No personality or development just boom boom pow.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Expensive parody of itself,"If you're an adult and like Deadpool ""humor"" this might be for you. If you're a kid, you probably like pretty colors, lots of characters, and wackiness.As a movie though, it's like this one has too many ingredients and no time to make sure everything fits together and has cooked properly. Exactly like kids making their dinner on their own, and then end up with a mess everywhere and giggle about it.Maybe it's because the writers were given an impossible task, like telling a chef to use everything inside a mall for one dish. ""You can't put cat litter in food"" -sure you can, it fits in the pot and we've already paid for it.The result is busy introducing new characters, fierce characters doing stupid stuff, all the while trying to keep the story intact and then giving up, which is the actual ending of the movie.There were many things along the way that showed like they struggled with the mess and took easy solutions with their hands up. Dialogs shot with experienced actors, which gave serious Owe Boll vibes and should have been rewritten, reshot, or left on the cutting room floor. And how do we solve the problem of getting the God of Thunder captured? With a bug zapper. Next problem.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Overkill with the Comedy!!!,"Thor is such a great and epic hero. Why did they ruin such a great story by throwing in constant joke after joke after joke?! Some comedy is of course appreciated, but this was just making a fool out of every single character. It was impossible to feel any feelings towards them and connect to the story. I could not feel the tragedy and the triumph that this had the potential for. I am really hoping and wishing that another Thor movie comes out and returns to its original tone. This was just terrible...5 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,No. Just no.,"This movie was pure trash! You could tell just by watching the beginning, okay I get it a little comedy is okay every now and then but there was too much comedy.

Thor: Ragnarok,"Another C-Rate Director by Disney - No Taste, Spoofish Feel","Movie Mood Level: Spoofish.Not sure why Disney is letting bottom-shelf talent handle top-shelf content once again (Star Wars '17). The level of humor was drought, effortless, disappointing, overworked yet ever-trying, and must have been most likely very embarrassing for the actors at times. Was the choreography union on strike? Screenwriters too? Writers? Where was the talent aside from the actors? The movie's marketing campaign of ""fun"" is a joke and disgrace to every good action-comedy out there.Rian Johnson, Taika Waititi.. you stand together as equals.Disney - With great power comes great responsibility.

Thor: Ragnarok,Thor Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 are interchangeable,"I liked the first Thor movie probably more than others. I think all actors did a great job, and the introduction of Thor and Loki was very well done. Despite being a mess Thor The Dark World had some good moments between Thor and Loki as well. Thor Ragnarok has been praised by many for being the best of the three Thor films. Unfortunately I am not one of those who enjoyed the film.I watched Thor Ragnarok in theater before I watched GOTG2 on Netflix. The countless jokes especially the middle section lost me with its kindergarten level back and forth between Thor and Hulk and Thor and Korg. I went back to watch the film again just to make sure it wasn't me being tired or not paying attention the first time. My impression remains the same: Nothing of significance happens for an hour in the middle of the movie. It's just Thor and Hulk and Korg and others being childish and foolish and obnoxious and talking nonsense. Any quiet/emotional moment, there might be only two in the whole film, between Thor and Loki, is either interrupted or followed by a lame joke. Even the destruction of Asgard is followed by a joke. The result is that not only could I not root for any of the characters, even those I previously cared about, I now deeply resent this ""refurbished"" Thor, and would definitely not watch any future solo Thor outings, if there is any, hopefully no more. Not mentioning I couldn't care for the plot, story, Asgard getting destroyed. If these Asgardians get wiped out in Avengers Infinity War, as suggested in the new IW trailer, I won't care either. Thor might very well make another joke about it and all is well.What makes matters worse is that I watched GOTG2 the other day on Netflix. I missed GOTG2 in theaters because I wasn't a big fan of the first one. It's disturbing to me how similar the movie is to Thor Ragnarok. Nothing important happens in the movie. Everybody is super jokey. Father issues. There are massacres of faceless people in the most ""glorious"" fashion (Yondu/Valkyrie). A villain gets his/her power from a planet (Ego/Hela)and loses when said planet is destroyed. Sibling rivalry, reconciliation and oh a hug at the end, one shown one not shown. Last but not least, atrocious editing. It became clear to me Thor Ragnarok copied a lot from GOTG2, as GOTG2 came out first and Thor Ragnarok had major reshoots two months after GOTG2's cinema debut, I could swear many things were added hastily during Thor reshoot just because they sorta worked in GOTG2.There are some minor differences between the two movies: GOTG2 made some efforts in making certain scenes emotional. Didn't work all the time but at least it tried. Thor Ragnarok did not even make any attempt to do so. GOTG2 has poorer jokes, because everybody is screaming at the top of their lungs. Thor Ragnarok does a bit better in the jokes department, not because the jokes themselves are any better, but because actors are not screaming all the time. Thor Ragnarok has better actors (Ruffalo/Hiddleston/Blanchett), GOTG2 has better cinematography. In the end, the two films are so similar now I cannot tell apart Star Lord from Thor. In fact, I cannot tell Thor apart from Spider-Man either, since I saw Spider-Man Homecoming after seeing Thor Ragnarok as well and Thor and Spider-Man appear to be of same mental age and have exactly the same speech patterns. So good job, Marvel. Thanks a lot for saving me from any anguish contemplating how everything will turn out in a future Marvel film. Next time a Marvel film comes out, I already know what is going to happen in the movie. It's Thor/Star Lord/Spider-Man/their clones joking their way through the whole movie while the world crumbles around them, since they don't care, why should I?",1
Thor: Ragnarok,A thundering bore...,"... and a lesson on how to make $180 million look cheap as chips. The overall kitsch 80s feel is a monument to bad taste, and a baboon could have come up with a better plot.

Thor: Ragnarok,Nonsensical driveling story. Avoid it and save yourself the aggravation,"What a letdown! After the success of the great Captain America movies and most of the Avengers ones i confess myself disillusioned and perplexed by this new installment.Most of the movie feels like an extended version of the pod-racing scene on Star Wars Episode I with an ever-present Jar Jar Binks: absurd and irrelevant, forcing a quick and mediocre finale. Thor, the god of thunder, is reduced to a babbling moron who needs to be reminded that he is indeed a god and as such has powers. The story, if i can call it that, will probably remind you of the redneck avengers parody on youtube, but even that short script is far better. Whoever wrote this script seems to have been hellbent on wiping his butt on the Marvel characters and Universe by producing the most fetid turd of a movie he could think of with the complicity of the director.I cannot understand how so many famous actors and actresses accepted a role in this film catastrophe. I thought they read scripts before accepting a role, but i guess not. Perhaps the only two actors not portrayed as morons were Benedict Cumberbatch and Cate Blanchett. Even a talented actor like Tom Hiddleston comes out with a tarnished reputation, and don't get me started on Sir Anthony Hopkins. I feel sorry for both.On top of all that, there was far too much mediocre special effects.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Worse super hero movie!,"What a rip off this movie is? They used the title Thor to make a cheap version of the series. People gave it good reviews because of the basic humour... Really, I love a good comedy but Thor is not where i would try to find it. I would rather watch Dumb and Dumber over and over. Hulk acting like a baby, playing with a bouncing ball... Thor throwing a ball at a window only to have the ball ricochet back and hit him in the face to knock him flat? What is this?
Thor's hammer seems so light and fake. The movie sets look like Sesame Street. Wood panels cheaply painted with a bunch of bright colors. The costumes are ridiculous. The CGI is the worse, the special effects don't even try to seem realistic. Nowadays I can do better with an iPhone. Cate Blanchett is too good an actress for her role. 
The only character that brings back the usual Thor vibe is Idris Elba as Heimdall..
They should have begged Kenneth Branagh or Alan Taylor to direct this one too.

Thor: Ragnarok,Generic MCU crap,"This movie is a perfect example of what the MCU has become.
This is just another superhero movie. Has no depth. If you just want a good laugh and some action sequences, go for it. But if you want a decent movie with emotion, character , and some depth, then this movie is a waste of time.
Thor Ragnarok represent what a generic MCU movie is like. I used to love the MCU movies but ever since they started making shit like this I'd not recommend anyone to watch such crap.
The movie pretty much follows the same formula:
Comedic Sequence
Action Sequence
Emotional sequence
repeat.
The fact that Odin dies and thor is just jumping around and laughing seems absurd. I'd say they did a poor job with the emotional spectrum and this is not what a superhero movie should be like.4 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Worst of the Thors,"I'm not a Disney lover by no means!!! They did do some marvel movies that were good like the first two Thor's, but this one shows what all of us who see Disney for the ruiners they are!!! This was a fast cash grab for the avengers movie & NOT a stand alone movie!! It's a crossover like the last two Caption America's, last two Iron Man's, the new spider man movies!!!
This has some laughs when it's not supposed to be a comedy but fails as a super hero movie in every way!!! Thor is the god of thunder but for most of the movie, they make him look week!! A small disc gets planted on his neck & is used to control him!! A god is not controlable people!!! His hammer gets destroyed by his sister, (the hammer is indestructible)!!! He gets dropped basically, on a junk planet with Jeff G. as ruler!! Hulk has been there for two years & never changes back until he sees an archive clip of Black Widow!!! It's a pathetic attempt at a comic movie!!! These types of movies must be stopped before they get ruined for good!!",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Guardins from a stupid galaxy and it's not Thor's,"15 whole minutes I watched this sitcom for, 15 minutes, and it was enough to put anybody off the 'superpants' genre for life. (An ego they aren't clowns in diapers, but are providing an alternative role models). It was a bad as watching musical stupid heroes. They might as well have sung themselves into Valhalla. No it was worse, they told really stupid fart jokes almost every time they spoke, while flicking 'snot' at the screen, (CGI goop grunting) upon using posh English accents. And in utter disdain I have boycotted Thor and these stupid heroes from memory.Don't bother. You will probably find it worst, because if it was that bad, the source material has vanished.

Thor: Ragnarok,Monty Python meets Deadpool for 5 y.o... and not in a good way.,"Horribly executed production for kinderg√§rtners. Boring and predictable. Full of stupid jokes yet not funny. Actors' accents made it even more absurd. The decorations and props were extremely poor even for a comedy movie. Monty Python and Army of Darkness had designing of much better quality, it's unbelievable. We are in a world of papier mache weapons, Styrofoam walls and plastic armor straight from the toy section of Walmarts.The Villain's outfit is basic af. Even this headpiece looks cheap... Darling, the Boulet Brothers serve more exciting outfits in they Friday night gigs. Such a talented cast, but the acting is next to non-existent. No chemistry between characters. Especially Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo. You can see them thinking ""please make it stop, I need to go home"". And they even used a 16-bit music pack from the random video game. God, this movie is bad.I've never read the comic book, but I am shocked at the positive reception of this garbage.",1

Go see it if you are a teenager and unaware of the Marvel Comics universe.

Take away the Hulk v Thor fight and there's not much left.
Honestly only one fight in the gladiator arena is not enough.AWFUL!! cheesy, dumb, and desperately trying to get in on the success of guardians of the galaxy. This doesn't feel like any of the previous Avenger related films, and what they did to Hulk is shameful. One of the worst films i have ever watched. That being said, if you like GotG, and GotG2 then you'll probably appreciate the humor in this more than i did.What the hell happened? It's like Thor meets Monty Python on one of their off days. Risible humour. Loki has definitely put on weight. Odin in a care home. I will be turning this off any time soon. Hopefully Cate Blanchett will infect some life into this mess of a movie. Oops Cate is as camp as Christmas like a taller version of Wednesday Adams. Marvel is dead in the water. Where is the off switch?",1

The dialogue and CGI was like they were pandering to toddlers. The plot was dumb, overall a waste of time. There is no way that fans gave this an 8.0 on their own.

Thor: Ragnarok,Another nail in the coffin for superhero movies,"There's nothing here but the same formula, with a few tweaks for the mentally ill simpletons to think it's something different. To say it's ""different"" or a ""change of pace"" (which some people are) is just stupid . The fact that this is a superhero movie alone negates all possibility that there is anything remotely refreshing or different about it.The attempts at constant ""jokes"" are just obnoxious. Besides, I don't think that a movie that is in fact one big joke would be able to swallow that irony.As for the actors there's the always annoying, uninteresting, no-count lead actor who plays thor-what's his name again? lol, yeah, like that matters. A plank of wood would have more character than this no-count, who in this movie looks like he just freshly pulled his head out of some guy's crevice.As for the other ones, they could have gotten a more attractive actress to play Valkyrine (did I misspell that?), so then at least there would be something fun to look at despite the obnoxiousness of the character. All the hot musclegirls there are these days and yet they couldn't get one for this role? No excuse for that really.Same goes for Cate Blanchett who plays Hela for that matter. Hey Cate, they're called implants, look them up some time, hit the thick glutes training while you're at it. Might have made this character remotely interesting....but probably still not. Hopefully at least she'll die horribly at some point.I used to respect Jeff Goldblum more, mostly for his older roles and that respect will dissipate quickly if he keeps taking roles like the one here. Maybe he's starting to think he should have stuck with his jazz piano playing.How do these movies even make money in an age of peer-to-peer downloading or get any good reviews? I know a lot of people are basically either paid off or obliged to make fake good reviews, and I suppose the big studio and finance system takes full advantage out of the special interest group of depressed, lost, and thor-oughly butt-stuck idiocrats out there, apparently before they kill themselves, too depressed and too in a mental fugue to know what they're doing with what's left of their lives, exposing themselves to things that's probably just making them even more unhappy. Although the lack of choice presented to these poor people has much to do with all this of course. And the suicide and mass shooting rate continues to rise....Anyway, this is yet another marvel/comic book movie that would truly sully any landfill site. Another nail in the coffin for superhero movies no doubt. Another completely irrelevant movie (even irrelevant to entertainment) that already feels very old and done for.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,The Only Thing Useful For The Devil's Would Be To Throw Every Copy Of This Movie Into It!,"A bigger fan of comic books, comic book movie adaptations and the subsequent merchandise than me you would be hard pressed to find but this movie is a juvenile and poorly written piece of trash the likes of which the actors and characters did not deserve to be associated with. From drunk Valkyries to naked Hulk this movie is filled with jokes a 10 year old boy would find funny. The director fancies himself a funny, funny man indeed. Well then perhaps his calling was to a career in stand up comedy where some of this low brow humor might land on willing ears. I'd rather be tied up and forced to watch the entire season of The Inhumans on infinite loop rather than be subjected to this film even one more time. Howard The Duck had better jokes than this and at least wasn't afraid to push the envelope into R rated territory but what we get with this allegedly family friendly romp through the halls of a junior high school hallway between bells is something which makes Tyler Perry filmmaking look like top tier cinematic entertainment. On the other hand it sure seems a fitting prequel to the forthcoming Love & Thunder which sounds as if it will only amp up the sophomoric gross out jokes from this abomination of a movie!

Thor: Ragnarok,The movie is fun but Hela's character is such a disappointment,"I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so and thought it was a great start (minus some of the utterly eye-rolling attempts at humor), but for me it all sort of came to a screeching halt once Odin died and it was revealed that Hela was Thor's sister.It was just a terrible writing decision for the character and made her look like nothing more than a second-rate Loki clone. It pretty much destroyed the entire movie for me because I was really hoping this character would be another good villain like Vulture, but alas she is probably one of the worst to date. Visually her costume design was perfect, she was surprisingly hot to look at, and Cate Blanchett played her well enough (it was far from her best performance mind you), but the character writing itself was horribly lazy and unoriginal. She was just a completely one-note and stupidly overpowered character who was evil for the sole purpose of being evil and was angry at people who punished her for being evil. And every scene between her and Thor felt incredibly awkward and forced because the two had no established relationship with one another and no real reason to hate each other (unlike Loki who already had more development in the first half of the first Thor movie than Hela did throughout the entire course of this film). Her not looking anything like Thor or Odin in appearance didn't do her any favors either. She had practically no interaction with any of the main protagonist characters aside from talking to Thor for maybe 5 minutes at the most throughout the entire movie. Most of her screen time was wasted on Skurge (another lame villain who I'll talk about later). And the big, ugly, rotten cherry on top of all of this is that she practically had no real plan once she got Asgard, so her threat didn't feel genuine to me. The only reason there was a conflict at all during the final battle is because she was too focused on making her grand introduction to take the Bifrost Sword upon arriving in Asgard as to avoid it being stolen by Heimdall. I guess her plan was to destroy the other eight realms while rambling about her ego?I know it's a fantasy film, but whoever wrote this seriously expects the audience to believe that Hela was just born looking the way she did with the set of powers that she had; powers that no other Asgardian possessed and an appearance that looked like she should have been related to Loki instead of Thor? Sorry, I just don't support stuff like this. As a big fan of Cate Blanchett it's depressing that she was wasted like this and I don't think the character writing deserved her in the role or her perfect costume design at all.The good news, however, is that if you are not like me and didn't expect or want much out of Hela then you will probably love this film. The main Thor vs. Hulk fight was great and I actually rather enjoyed the banter between the two on Sakaar. Thor's character arc here was a massive improvement over The Dark World, but I still prefer his arc from the first Thor movie just due to my bias preference for that film. Valkyrie was also a decent and welcome character, but they could have done more with her IMO. Loki was still on point but I wish we had seen him interact with Doctor Strange more; that cameo from Cumberbatch was great. However, once they got to Asgard for the final battle it all fell apart for me again because there was no real weight to it; partly due to Hela's terrible character writing and partly due to the nonstop humor which just didn't work during a serious battle.Jeff Goldblum and Karl Urban were also completely wasted on lame one-note side characters who didn't do anything particularly memorable throughout the entire film... well in all fairness Skurge had a cool final battle scene, but that's about it.Overall this film could have been way better had the main villain's character writing been at least passable (it was considerably below average IMO) and had the final battle just been more serious. But taking all of my issues into consideration, it sits at the very bottom of the barrel for me when it comes to the MCU - and I have not once walked out of a single MCU movie outright hating it prior to the night I saw Ragnarok.7/10 without Hela's horrible writing and the disappointing final battle, 1/10 with everything included.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,"Disaster, Its own parody","Give return my 2 hours. This movie is its own parody! There are lot of jokes, which are terrible. What did they do with Thor? He is like a stupid cheerleading girl. ""My hair, do not cut my hair"". I want to forget it!",1
Thor: Ragnarok,"Blackwashing, too many jokes, but very funny okayish movie","Not sure what to say or think about this movie. It is hilariously fun, and the jokes are well woven into the narrative, the acting great, the action amazing. In almost every aspect this is the perfect action-y superhero movie, but I still do not like it...Out of all the Thor movies, this is probably my least favorite, and that is saying something.The reason? Well, the blackwashing for one. Again we see Hollywood destroy a great character only because they want to get rid of white people. It is racism, and that racist idea of exchanging white characters with black ones leave a bad taste in my mouth. Secondly there are way, way too many jokes in here. And worse: they joke when people are dying. Oh, a planet is destroyed and millions are dying? Well, let us joke about it. And laugh, and laugh... This is probably the blackest, darkest, most world changing movie (or topic of a movie) Marvel has done, but it ends up being slapstick comedy within a buddy road-trip. This movie feels like they've almost made a spoof move about something serious, and I do not like it at all.This movie should have been dark, gritty, serious, and the focus should have been on the blood, the dying, the ending of a world, but instead we get characters making jokes. This is not the movie I wanted and it is not a movie about Ragnarok. This is a comedy movie about friends going on an adventure. No... I do not like it...Also there are tons of topics just glanced over. Warriors three dying? Well, lets skip over that quickly shall we. Sif not in the movie? Nah, who cares. Loki was Odin the last time around, well let us joke about that and move on.I still give this movie a 5. It is very entertaining, it is funny, and the action is mostly fantastic. I can however not get over the fact that this movie should have been something completely different and in combination with bad taste jokes, and the racism, I cannot give it a higher score. Probably my least favorite Marvel movie so far and I hope that this movie does not spill over into other future Marvel movies, because this is how you kill a franchise...",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Horrendous,"It takes an awful lot for me to not like a fantasy movie. Ragnarok succeeded, though. I'm convinced that this project was written and directed by toddlers. The cringe factor of the dialogue alone is off the charts. The action is good but the FX are decidedly not. It could have been SO good but it's a bad, bad movie.

Thor: Ragnarok,Disappointed,"It was just a real big disappointment compared to the first Thor movie. It brought in another character from the MCU (like all marvel movies nowadays), which personally seemed poorly done to me. But the movie just didn't seem like Thor. And I couldn't last through the entire movie.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Thor: Ragnarok is... Loathsome and Revolting!,"Let me just get right to it: It sucks! It stinks! It's a rotting pile of old brussel sprouts (my apologies if you like brussels) mixed with wet dog fur and topped with old braunschweiger for good measure. Okay, now that I've summed it up, let's get to the meat of it.For starters, it's a Marvel movie, and a Thor movie, of which I am not a fan. But that aside, I tried it anyway. *sigh*The characters are simply deplorable. It seems that each and every one of them is raunchy, over the top, and just plain unlikable. The worst of the lot is Vallkyrie (Tessa Thompson), whose name doesn't even make sense because it refers to her occupation. She is rude, drunk, and violent. Thor is, as always, completely annoying. His constant cheeky remarks quickly get tiresome. Hela (Cate Blanchett) is a typical villain, with no color or originality about her (well, she has antlers, but still). Loki (Tom Hiddleston) requires no complaint, but also evokes no praise either. Then we come to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), who literally owns a space junkyard. My critique of him alone, should I write it, would be several pages.The plot is awful; you care nothing for what's going on. The action is too busy to even look at. I usually go on a bit more, but all I can say is 'Thor: Ragnarok' is ""Yuck!!!""",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Lame Joke followed by even more lame jokes,"Was this meant to be a kids movie?
Dont mind a few jokes in a superhero movie every now and then.

Thor: Ragnarok,One of the worst first 5 minutes of a movie I can remember!,"I just couldn't bring myself to watch this after the first 5 minutes. There were so many lame jokes packed into the first few sequences, it was cringe worthy. They were ""heh"" funny at first but persisted to repeat themselves as if they'd suddenly become funnier the 2nd and 3rd time round. They weren't.The cringe worthy spectacle continued into the second scene where, I'm guessing some kind of villain, decided he'd have a go at talking like Danny Dyer from football factory. By this point I realised I'd made a mistake.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
Thor: Ragnarok,The name of the game is Ragnarok...kind of,"Thor: Ragnarok is a Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off. Plain and simple. It was a sci-fi comedy full of Guardians of the Galaxy's similarity both visually and in its humor. The film was packed with joke and the actions in the movies are weak. The movie is about something as dark and serious as Ragnarok yet the movie fails to show any seriousness to it and shows how little the subject is for the character to not have any sense of urgency towards it at all. Speaking of character, Thor was not Thor for the majority of the film. His personality has been push toward that of Tony Stark, where he makes jokes at nearly every single moment in the film. Regardless, Thor has some moments in the film that were funny along side that of Mark Ruffalo's Hulk and Tom Hiddleston's Loki. However, the hype the movie built surrounding that of the Valkyrie was just that, nothing but hype. During Thor's first meeting with the Valkyrie, Tessa Thompson was hyped to be a major or focal point in the film but during the climax unfortunately did nothing but show up here and there.In conclusion, Thor: Ragnarok was a huge sci-fi clustered comedy movie with inconsistency in it's character strength all because the director rather have a movie full of jokes rather than a character driven, story driven and action packed film.A funny movie doesn't make it a great movie and that's what superhero critics fails to understand.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Planet Hulk feat. Thor,"I adored the first two Thor movies. They had the right mix of humor and serious plot with well-timed jokes and excellent character development- something this film was severely lacking. Thor seemed to have regressed back to the Thor from the beginning of the first movie, when he was even the focus. Despite being the title character it felt like the main character of the movie was anybody but Thor. Hulk in particular got a lot of focus in the Planet Hulk portion of the movie, which really should have been its own movie rather than taking over Thor. vent though this film was the longest of the three Thor films it was so packed full of unnecessary filler that the parts of the movie that were actually important get glossed over, happening in the blink of an eye to move on to more lengthy filler nonsense. In addition to Thor, Loki was also very poorly written. The god of mischief and lies shouldn't be predictable. Tom Hiddleston is an amazing actor but even he can't save this movie from its bad writing. It felt like the writers had no idea how to write the characters so they just recycled what they saw in the previous movies.
Worse yet, this whole movie was overrun with bad humor, as though they had tried to shoehorn in as many jokes as humanly possible in the two hour run time. For the ""What was Thor doing during Civil War?"" short the humor worked and made me laugh but for a movie with so much death about the destruction of Asgard and the end of Asgardian civilization as we know it it should be far more serious. All the humor does is downplay the gravity of the situation and the ""comedic timing"" was such that serious situations got turned into jokes and ruined the whole moment. It got to a point where any joke made me cringed or groan in exasperation.
I went to Deadpool to see Deadpool. I didn't go to Thor to see Deadpool, but that's what I got and while Deadpool was great Thor Ragnarok was a complete dumpster fire.",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Absolute Cringe Comedy,"When did epic,passionate and badass movies die and were replaced with cringe comedies? I'm so confused by the direction this movie took and why it (and most previously serious movies) has become a huge joke..The movie had so much potential to be unique,epic,amazing and mind blowing, but instead there had to be cringey and awkward jokes and terrible lines every few minutes. This movie was made for simple children and brainless adults who will laugh at and not question anything. Lines that dont make sense,scenes that dont jive with the rest,characters that normally would be out of place in anything but a children movie or poor quality comedy are ever present and given major roles. Its a disgrace to the genre and the series.. I will not be watching another Thor in theaters again!3 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1

Thor: Ragnarok,Bad casting welcome back cheesy movies,This is like the old Batman movies with Jim Carrey absolutely terrible and cheesy I guess that is what they were going for. They have a woman who is 5 foot 4 playing a Valkyrie and now anybody can beat up Loki with ease. The writing stupid a 7th grader would not have made the mistakes they did. Thor is basically a wimp thru the movie he can't beat the tiny Valkyrie or the hulk and there are two villains and one of them is Jeff Goldblum really !? The writing was all over the place along with the bad casting they turned this into and old 1970 or 1980 cheesy movie they had Thor begging and whinnying it was the worse super hero movie of the 21st century. I would have given this zero stars but the lowest it will let me go is 1. Hey on the bright side if you are between the ages of 5 and 10 you might like this can't be sure because they have gotten used to good movies I hope if they make another the do not hire the same director the same producer the same casting agent or the writers... Did the writers even see the other movie's ? They embarrassed the franchise and the critics want to pick on Ben Affleck when they had enough garbage here to last them a life time if you have not seen this don't it will make you hate the franchise and trust me you have not missed anything.,1
Thor: Ragnarok,Surreal,"The Good: Visually I loved pretty much everything about it (minus some of the Sakaar scenes). The film certainly has its moments, and I loved the overall storyline when it was properly used (which isn't very often, I'll talk about this more in ""The Bad"" section). All of the cast are very solid in their roles even if they are a bit annoying at times (Grandmaster I found particularly annoying). Most of the action sequences are well done and easily some of the best parts of the film. My favorite scenes of the entire film are the scenes when Hela kills the Asgardian soldiers, Hela explains her backstory, and the scene where she resurrects the dead soldiers and Fenris with the Eternal Flame.She was actually my favorite part of the film. She has plenty of good action sequences, is tons of fun to see on screen, has a passable amount of screen time, and has some decent dialogue when it isn't hindered by the comic relief. However, the only things that really make her a step above most of Marvel's past bland villain offerings are the performance, visuals, and of course the fun factor. Hela is essentially to this film what Tim Curry's Pennywise was to the 90's IT miniseries. Loki is easily my second favorite part of the film as he is still a great character and we've gone for far too long without seeing him on the big screen.The Bad: This is one of those movies where they show you a lot of good story elements but never fully utilize them - ever. To me it almost feels like an attempt by the studio to troll the audience by saying ""Hey, we know we can do this, but we won't anyway and instead we'll substitute it for comic relief or pretend it didn't happen"". I can't tell if the writing was originally this lazy or if it just turned out that way because of the humor. I didn't feel that any of the characters had their backstories explored to their full potential. Grandmaster was by far the most underused as we only get these vague hints as to his origin. Hela's backstory is ironically the most fully-explained albeit still not fully utilized. Skurge was a joke.And of course, now we get to that part. Albeit overused in the MCU's past, humor has never been something that fully hindered by ability to enjoy any of their movies. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. The opening scene with Thor and Surtur pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film from start to finish. The final battle is by far the weakest part of the film, both due to the nonstop one-liners and the fact that very little emphasis is actually put on the coming of Ragnarok until near the end of the battle. I wanted there to be some humor in this, but not American Werewolf in London-level humor where I just can't stomach stake and ice cream on the same plate.Conclusion: Overall it was an enjoyable watch and I'm certainly glad I went to see it. However, despite its moments, I can't help but feel that the film was a massive waste of potential on so many levels. They show you so many glimpses of really good stuff, but whenever you think they'll use it, they don't. Thor (2011) is by far the superior film in my book, although this is still far better than The Dark World where the entertainment factor is concerned.On my first viewing I'd give it a solid 6/10. I may very well be coming off more negative than I really mean to sound and I might be a bit too harsh. I desperately wanted to like this more when walking out of the theatre, but I simply cannot bring myself to. If the rumor is true that they made this a full-blown comedy to make the ""impact"" of Infinity War greater, then it is truly a shame that they had to sacrifice the quality of what could have been one of the best MCU installments in exchange for something else. Who knows, I may change my mind on a second viewing.Post credits scenes are nothing worth staying for this time around.",1
Thor: Ragnarok,Identitiy Politics barf,"Yeah, it started a few years before, but this is where it really switched its gears up ... like the disgraceful 1-sentence Elimination of Jane Foster and the reasoning of the producers why she had to go: ""Because they needed someone ""MORE SUITED"" instead of Jane"". Yeah, how about someone who just happens to be black because we all know that Valkyrie, a nordic cultural goddess, was black, right?
And all this according to the director because he wanted to be ""more inclusive"".
What do you mean more inclusive? More inclusive by completely destroying established characters with a total disregard for a whole culture?
Pathetic.
Wanna be inclusive? How about this then: Make the next inclusive movie with Martin Luther King played by a blonde, nordic, blue eyed white dude?2 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink",1
